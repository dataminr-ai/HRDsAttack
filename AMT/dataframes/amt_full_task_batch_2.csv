Officials have also accused demonstrators of causing damage and economic losses estimated at more than $68m as people have not been able to go to work and businesses were forced to shut.</p> <p>Deputy Prime Minister Themba Masuku said the king is open to having a dialogue with all sectors of society once the violence ends and the coronavirus pandemic is over.</p> <p>“We are ready to engage,” Masuku told Al Jazeera. “But it is important to note that any engagement must be in an environment of calm, of peace,” he added.</p> <p>Protesters, however, are showing no sign of giving up. Longtime activist Madzabudzaru Kunene, who lost one of his legs to police fire during an earlier round of protests, said he would not stop demanding democratic reforms, regardless of the risk.</p> <p>“I will fight even if their will cut my other leg, and if I will still have hands, they will have my hands, until they cut my heart,” Kunene told Al Jazeera.</p> <p>“That is the way I will stop.”</p>",2
974052754,Jury Acquits Iowa Journalist Andrea Sahouri Who Was Prosecuted For Covering Protest,2021-03-11 00:00:00,"<p>Free press advocates are celebrating after a jury in Iowa acquitted journalist Andrea Sahouri.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Des Moines Register reporter was found not guilty of failing to disperse and interfering with official acts while she was covering a Black Lives Matter protest in May of 2020. She was facing misdemeanor charges that could have resulted in fines and 30 days in jail.</p> <p>Her case, unusual for a journalist in the U.S., was seen as a test for the First Amendment.</p> <p>After feeling exhausted this week, 25-year-old Sahouri woke up on Thursday feeling ""powerful"" because she got to tell the world her side of the story. Being acquitted of an unjust arrest sets a precedent, she says.</p> <p>Sahouri says she was only doing her journalistic duties when a police officer Luke Wilson pepper sprayed her and her then-boyfriend, who she says insisted on accompanying her for protection. After pepper spraying her ""right in the face at close range,"" the officer then arrested her on the spot and told her, ""'That’s not what I asked,' she recalls.</p> <p>She identified herself as a journalist many times throughout the ordeal, she says. As she was running away from tear gas, an officer began to charge at her. She froze, put her hands up, and repeatedly verbalized that she was a part of the press, she recalls.</p> <p>On the day of her arrest, Sahouri was not wearing press credentials, which isn't required, she says. As she waited in jail, Sahouri says she kept telling officers she worked for the Register.</p> <p>Police body cam footage, shown to the six-person jury, corroborated Sahouri's account of the events leading up to the arrest. Register reporters on the scene were ""covering it well and while following police orders,"" she says. ""The evidence clearly proves that and the jury also agreed.""</p> <p>Wilson testified that his unit was ordered to coat the area with pepper spray to disperse protesters at the scene, NPR reports. He also said he did not know she was a journalist at the time of her arrest.</p> <p>Other journalists were arrested in similar situations across the country last summer, but very few of them were actually prosecuted like Sahouri. The cases against other members of the press were almost immediately dropped. The journalist says she still questions why the state of Iowa would ""waste resources to pursue this case.""</p> <p>Sahouri is Palestinian. She's questioned in the past if perhaps race played a role in the state's motivation to prosecute her. While she can't prove motive, she says she lets the facts speak for itself.</p> <p>""I was the only journalist of color at that protest. I was with another reporter who was right next to me as I was arrested and she wasn’t arrested,"" Sahouri says. ""She was able to go.""</p> <p>There was a lot at stake for the freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Sahouri's case. She believes it could have had harsh impacts on silencing both journalists and protestors if she had not been acquitted.</p> <p>""It’s essential for us to be able to document historical moments,"" she says. ""And without journalists, I can’t even imagine what our society would be like today.""</p> <p>Chris Bentley produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Tinku Ray.

Eyad al-Gharib is charged with arranging the torture of at least 30 opposition activists arrested after a demonstration in 2011.</p> <p>Arrested in February 2019, the two men are being tried in the Higher Regional Court in the German city of Koblenz.</p> <p>Human rights organizations and a former regime photographer have documented the deaths of thousands of detainees from torture, execution, and inhuman conditions in regime prisons.

This trial will break the immunity of the criminals in Syria, from the head of the regime all the way down.</p> <p>Human rights organizations and Syrian activists are called on other states to follow Germany’s steps, and to provide support for the documentation of war crimes.

This would not have been possible without the bravery and sacrifices of Syrian survivors, families of victims, and scores of other individuals and organisations who have relentlessly pursued justice and truth, often putting their own lives at risk in doing so. At a time when Syrians feel that the international community has failed them, this trial brings renewed hope that some measure of justice is still possible.</p> <p>Hamoudi Shoaib, tortured in northeast Syria in 2011 and a refugee in Germany since 2014, said, “To me, just the fact those people are having a fair trial in a respectable court feels like a revelation.

I just want justice.”</p> <p>From Official to Defector to Torture Defendant</p> <p>Anwar Raslan was head of the investigations team of Branch 251, the intelligence directorate prison in Damascus notorious for its torture of detainees.</p> <p>He defected in 2013 with a Syrian rebel escorting him out of the capital to the opposition-held area of East Ghouta and then to Jordan.</p> <p>Raslan built up his position with opposition leaders and was even in an opposition delegation at UN talks in Geneva in 2014. He flew to summer that summer and settled with his family in northeast Berlin.</p> <p>But German prosecutors built up a case, based on documents smuggled out of Syria by opposition activists. The indictment says that, while Raslan was in charge of Branch 251, at least 4,000 people were tortured and 59 died from April 2011 to September 2012.</p> <p>Wael al-Khalid, an opposition activist who helped Raslan defect, said the former official agreed to hand over the files of more than 20,000 detainees but never delivered on the promise.</p>",2

On Thursday, the government issued a decree to disband the protests. Photo by Narong Sangnak/EPA-EFE</p> <p>Oct. 15 (UPI) -- The prime minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha declared a state of emergency on Thursday in response to escalating protests calling for pro-democracy reforms in the kingdom. The decree was issued after thousands of protesters on Wednesday took to the streets of Bangkok demanding the prime minister's resignation and for a new constitution, saying it allowed Prayut, who took the helm of the country in a 2014 coup, to unfairly maintain power during last year's elections.

927646095,"Zimbabwe: 1,300 Arrested in 24 Hours over Coronavirus Lockdown",2020-06-05 00:00:00,"<p>Zimbabwe police arrested 1,312 people nationwide on Tuesday for violating coronavirus quarantine measures as authorities reinforce lockdown restrictions, Zimbabwe’s state-owned newspaper The Herald reported on Thursday.</p> <p>National police spokesman Paul Nyathi confirmed Tuesday’s arrests to the newspaper. Security officials cited a “growing laxity” in people’s adherence to restrictions on movement as the main reason for the high number of arrests over the 24-hour period. Since March 31, law enforcement officials in Zimbabwe have arrested a total of 52,041 people for violating quarantine measures.</p> <p>According to the report, Zimbabwe police said they are making “special efforts” to track down escapees from coronavirus quarantine centers, a growing problem in the country that poses a major public health risk. On May 29, Zimbabwe police said they were “hunting down” over 100 people who escaped quarantine centers, which the national health minister referred to as “our source of danger” when describing the breakouts at the time.</p> <p>On Thursday, authorities said 158 people had escaped from quarantine and police had tracked down and arrested 26 of them. Police have also been cracking down on people entering the country illegally and said they had arrested 97 “border jumpers.”</p> <p>Zimbabwe requires people returning from abroad to enter a 21-day quarantine period at state-run quarantine centers to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Nearly all of Zimbabwe’s new coronavirus cases last week were linked to these quarantine centers. They reportedly hold hundreds of people returning to the country from abroad, sometimes involuntarily. Most of Zimbabwe’s returning travelers left the country seeking work in neighboring South Africa, the regional economic hub, or in Botswana, with which it also shares a border.</p> <p>“The total number of escapees from various quarantine centers in provinces across the country is now 158,” Nyathi said on Thursday. “Escapees who have been arrested are now 26 following the arrest of a 40-year-old woman who absconded from Vuti Quarantine Center in Mashonaland West. Since May 16, police have arrested 97 border jumpers and smugglers.”</p> <p>“We continue to urge the public to be health and security conscious and assist the police and other security services in the maintenance of law and order,” Nyathi added.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s government ordered troops and police to reinforce coronavirus lockdown measures in the capital, Harare, amid a recent surge in coronavirus infections which had “more than tripled” to 203 as of June 2, according to national health authorities.</p>",2

The defender’s lawyers reported that a judge had ordered his release for “good behaviour”.</p> <p>“It’s great news for Bernardo, his family and Guatemala’s Indigenous Mayan Q’eqchi’ communities that he can leave prison and be reunited with his loved ones after more than four years of being a prisoner of conscience. However, Bernardo remains convicted of a crime he did not commit and thus the Guatemalan authorities continue to criminalize him for his work in defence of human rights and the environment,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.</p> <p>After reviewing the criminal case against Bernardo Caal Xol, Amnesty International found that there was no evidence of the crimes he was accused of. The proceedings against him show similar patterns of criminalization that the organization has documented against other human rights defenders in Guatemala. Amnesty International therefore considers Bernardo Caal Xol a prisoner of conscience and has been campaigning globally for years for his immediate and unconditional release.</p> <p>It’s great news for Bernardo, his family and Guatemala’s Indigenous Mayan Q’eqchi’ communities that he can leave prison and be reunited with his loved ones after more than four years of being a prisoner of conscience.

Despite the lack of factual evidence to support the charges, on 9 November 2018, the court in Cobán sentenced him to 7 years and 4 months in prison for the crimes of aggravated robbery and aggravated illegal detention.</p> <p>It’s regrettable that in Guatemala unfounded criminal prosecutions aimed at harassing and obstructing the work of human rights defenders – particularly environmentalists and Indigenous people, and those who fight against impunity and corruption – are such a common tactic.

1016763675,Tanzania: No Justice for Zanzibar Election Violence,2021-11-29 00:00:00,"<p>Click to expand Image A woman walks past a wall with posters of presidential candidates in Zanzibar’s town on October 24, 2020.  2020 Patrick Meinhardt / AFP via Getty Images</p> <p>(November 30, 2021) – The Tanzanian government has not held security forces and aligned militia accountable for killings in Zanzibar during the 2020 elections, Human Rights Watch said today.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch research has found that at least 14 people died and 55 were injured, as police, soldiers, and armed men in civilian clothes teargassed and shot at crowds, between October 26 and 30, 2020. The armed men also arbitrarily arrested, detained, and tortured opposition supporters on Zanzibar’s main islands of Unguja and Pemba. Neither the Tanzanian central authorities nor Zanzibari authorities have acknowledged, let alone investigated, the full scale and toll of the violence, despite a public outcry within the country, and calls for investigations, including by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p> <p>“Tanzania’s authorities have not taken steps to ensure justice for family members of those who died, and survivors of the serious abuses that marred Zanzibar’s 2020 elections,” said Oryem Nyeko, Tanzania researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The leaders of both Zanzibar and Tanzania should demonstrate their commitment to justice by ensuring accountability and compensation for survivors and the families of those who died at the hands of government security forces.”</p> <p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 57 people by phone between October 2020 and November 2021, including victims and witnesses, journalists, and opposition party officials about election-related violence in Zanzibar, the semiautonomous archipelago.</p> <p>Around October 26, 2020, the Tanzanian government deployed an estimated 10,000 security forces to Unguja and Pemba islands in Zanzibar, just before Zanzibar’s two-day voting period on October 27 and 28. The residents interviewed said that security forces patrolled the streets, harassed residents and beat them, brandishing guns and chasing them away from public spaces, broke into homes, and indiscriminately fired teargas and live bullets. They imposed and enforced curfews, beating those who did not comply, and arbitrarily arrested residents, detaining some in unofficial sites for weeks. This climate of fear caused many people to flee affected areas across Zanzibar. “Those who couldn’t run were beaten,” said a 59-year-old resident of Nungwi, Unguja.</p> <p>On the evenings of October 26, 27, and 28 security forces shot into crowds near polling places on Pemba Island, killing at least nine people, including a 16-year-old student and a pregnant woman. On October 28 the violence and the chaos intensified as Zanzibar Electoral Commission officials counted the votes and the “Mazombi,” a Zanzibar government-aligned militia group, chased and beat people, including those who came to witness the counting.</p> <p>Almost all the witnesses interviewed said they did not report the killings because of the climate of fear brought on by the violence. Family members said when they did report killings to the police and other authorities, nothing came of it. One man said that the police fatally shot his 25-year-old son in the chest in the Kangagani village square in Pemba between 9 and 10 p.m. on October 27. He reported the shooting to a community leader and the police. He buried his son the next day, alongside two others who were killed that night. Human Rights Watch found that the police have still not taken any action.</p> <p>The Zanzibar authorities also attempted to control media coverage of abuses by blocking accredited journalists from filming security officials and entering some polling places. Police detained three journalists covering an opposition protest for an hour on October 29 in Zanzibar City, Unguja.</p> <p>On October 29 the Zanzibar Electoral Commission announced that Hussein Ali Mwinyi, of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, had won the election for president of Zanzibar and that John Magufuli, also of the CCM, had been re-elected president of Tanzania.</p> <p>The only official acknowledgment of the killings came on November 11, 2020, from the Tanzanian inspector general of police, Simon Sirro, who told the media that only two people had died during “sporadic violence” on October 26 and that opposition supporters killed a policeman on October 28. He did not address allegations of police involvement in the killings</p> <p>Human Rights Watch wrote letters to the offices of the presidents of Tanzania and Zanzibar, and to the Tanzania police force, to share findings and ask about the steps the authorities have taken to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by police officers, soldiers, and militia during the Zanzibar election, but has yet to receive a response.</p> <p>Zanzibar has experienced election-related violence in the past, especially during the 2000 and 2015 elections. “Every five years, people are killed and maimed,” said a resident of Pandani, Pemba. “This happens every election, and always after the elections, we don’t sleep at home.”</p> <p>Domestic, regional, and international human rights standards, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, prohibit the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials. Such standards enshrine the right to a remedy for gross human rights violations. Under the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms, security forces may use force only in proportion to the seriousness of the offense, and the intentional use of lethal force is permitted only when strictly unavoidable to protect life.</p> <p>“It is important to bring the cycles of election-related violence in Zanzibar to an end,” Nyeko said. “For this to happen, the Tanzanian and Zanzibari authorities should take urgent steps to rein in security forces and ensure justice.”</p> <p>For more details about the 2020 election-related violence in Zanzibar, accounts from victims and witnesses, and recommendations, please see below.</p> <p>Click to expand Image Zanzibar's anti-riot police officers stand guard by a group of men sitting on the ground during an operation after the opposition called for protests in Stone Town, on October 29, 2020 as tensions rise while the results of the general election are being announced.  2020 Marco Longari/AFP via Getty Images</p> <p>Governance, Police, and Justice Structures</p> <p>Zanzibar is a semiautonomous archipelago consisting of several islands off the coast of mainland Tanzania. Zanzibar is governed by both the central union government of Tanzania in Dodoma and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (Serikali Mapinduzi ya Zanzibar, SMZ) in Zanzibar City.</p> <p>Various security forces, as well as the Zanzibar government-affiliated militia, the Mazombi, were active in Zanzibar during the 2020 elections. The Tanzania Police Force and the army, the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF), are administered by the central union government and operate in both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. The Zanzibar Police Division is part of the larger Tanzania Police Force. Zanzibar also operates its own security forces, known as the “special departments,” “SMZ forces,” or the “Vikosi,” alongside the Tanzania Police Force. The Mazombi, or “Janjaweed,” are armed, hooded men in black civilian clothes.</p> <p>Unlike the centrally administered police force and army, both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar have separate Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions that are responsible for initiating, prosecuting, and supervising all criminal prosecutions in their respective jurisdictions.</p> <p>History of Election Violence in Zanzibar</p> <p>In January 2001 Tanzanian security forces killed at least 35 people and injured 600 in Zanzibar for protesting irregularities in the October 2000 elections. During a re-run of the 2015 presidential elections in March 2016, Zanzibar authorities violently arrested opposition members, banned public rallies, and suspended radio stations. The 2015 elections and the 2016 re-run were further hampered by the Mazombi threatening and harassing civilians and government critics. Unidentified men, suspected to be state agents, also abducted and threatened a Zanzibar-based journalist for covering the 2016 re-run.</p> <p>Neither the Tanzanian nor Zanzibari authorities have adequately investigated these abuses. The impunity for abuses by members of the ruling CCM party has thus contributed to the cycles of election-related violence, including the most recent events, in October 2020.</p> <p>Security Force, Mazombi Abuses in Zanzibar during the 2020 Elections</p> <p>Human Rights Watch found that during the 2020 elections, the Tanzanian and Zanzibar security forces, including the police, military, and Vikosi, as well as the Mazombi beat, teargassed, harassed, and shot residents on Unguja and Pemba islands, starting just before and ending just after the voting period. Some residents abandoned their homes and hid in neighboring forested areas for days or weeks.</p> <p>“Some people felt they were not safe to return [even after the elections],” said a 33-year-old resident of Kangagani village, Pemba. “[We didn’t return home] for two months until the situation came back to normal, and everyone was confident to come back.”</p> <p>Many witnesses and some victims’ family members said they did not report the abuses out of fear. “I didn’t report [his killing] anywhere,” said the relative of a man who was killed on Pemba. “First it was panic, we didn’t expect this to happen. Secondly, where do you report? Who will listen to you?”</p> <p>Beatings, Break-ins</p> <p>On October 26, 2020, masked security forces in unidentifiable uniforms began arriving in Nungwi village, northern Unguja. They announced an 8 p.m. curfew. Some witnesses said that they harassed people and broke into homes for at least four days, targeting young men for beatings. Police and soldiers caned anyone outside after curfew, including those returning home after prayer at about 8 p.m.</p> <p>On October 27, the day set aside for security personnel to vote, people in Nungwi were instructed to remain indoors after 1 p.m. Witnesses said that Mazombi beat anyone outside after 1 p.m. From about 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on October 28, the day set aside for the general population to vote, a witness said, the Mazombi set up a makeshift camp in Nungwi, took several people there, and beat them.</p> <p>“I could hear the voice of a man called Haji Hajibu,” said a 54-year-old witness. “He was brought here and beaten. He was stripped naked and told to go to a shop and find clothes.” The same witness said they had heard rumors about some rapes of women, but Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate this.</p> <p>That night, Nungwi residents protested the repression by blocking roads with stones and burning tires. The police responded with live bullets. Meanwhile, the security forces and Mazombi continued to break into and loot homes and shops and to beat people. “Doors were being smashed and forced entries were being made,” a 59-year-old resident of Nungwi said.</p> <p>In the Garagara neighborhood, Zanzibar City, security forces beat a 23-year-old man attending his shop, forced him to roll in a puddle of water, and humiliated him by forcibly cutting his hair with a knife.</p> <p>Burning, Shooting of Unarmed Residents</p> <p>From October 26 to 29, and again on November 11, numerous witnesses said security forces indiscriminately fired teargas and shot people in various locations on Unguja and Pemba, mostly at polling places, killing at least 14 people.</p> <p>Throughout the evening and night of October 26, security forces shot teargas and live bullets at people who had gathered at Chwaka Primary School, a polling place in Tumbe, northern Pemba, after hearing rumors that CCM supporters had been transported there to vote. At around midnight, Abdalla Said Abdalla, 24, was killed.</p> <p>A humanitarian worker described the chaos:</p> <p>Many Vikosi and police started coming. Even the army. [The security forces] were firing teargas and bullets. Just for the sake of firing. Everywhere. We were on the main road and could see [an official] was issuing orders: do this, do this.</p> <p>On the night of October 26 security forces shot people in the Kangagani village center, Pemba, killing at least three, including Asha Haji Hassan, who was pregnant. A 36-year-old witness, who was shot in her left thigh by armed uniformed men whom she believes were police and members of the Vikosi as she walked near the polling place at Kangagani Primary School about 9 p.m., said of Hassan’s shooting:</p> <p>I saw the men [who shot Asha and me], they came out of the voting center, they came on the main road. I don’t know the number, but they were many. Some kneeled, came down from the car, and shot. I believe those who kneeled were the ones who shot at me and the pregnant woman.</p> <p>A relative of Kombo Hamad Salim, 32, said that security forces in a police truck shot Salim in the chest about 30 minutes later as he sat with his friends on the playground of Kangagani Primary School. He died immediately.</p> <p>In Garagara, witnesses said, security forces fatally injured a 73-year-old woman after throwing teargas into her home. At around 11 a.m. on October 27, six armed men, believed to be from the Vikosi, based on their uniforms, went to the home of Saada Ali Hassan and demanded that her family surrender the young men living there. Shortly after they refused, the men threw teargas canisters and a flammable liquid at the house, causing it to catch fire. Hassan was resting and recovering from an illness in her room. Her 50-year-old daughter said:</p> <p>Mattresses were burning. Doors burning. She could not help herself. We had to try to help her, but we couldn’t because the fire was intense. It was very smoky. She was calling for help from her daughters.</p> <p>A policeman unaffiliated with the Vikosi entered and pulled Hassan from the room. The armed men stood by and watched without interfering or assisting. Hassan had severe burns, so her family took her to Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar City, where she remained until her death on December 8.</p> <p>Just after midnight on October 27 security forces guarding ballot boxes at the Mtemani Primary School, a polling place in Wete district, Pemba, shot live bullets at passersby, hitting at least three people, including a 16-year-old student, Massoud Salim Fadhal. His father said his other children saw a person in a black car instructing the security forces to shoot people outside the school.</p> <p>Ali Kombo Omar, a cleric at a nearby Islamic school who cleaned and prepared Fadhal’s body for burial, said the body was still bleeding from a bullet wound in his back.</p> <p>At about the same time, in Kinazini village, Pemba, security forces fired teargas and live bullets, hitting Ali Said Kombo, 28, who was with friends at a polling place watching the ballot boxes brought in for voting. His family did not take him to the hospital because they were afraid to go out due to the chaos, and he died several hours later.</p> <p>“They were teargassing, using live bullets,” said one of Kombo’s friends. “I didn’t see the people, but by the signs and their cars, they were security people.” He noted that they drove Toyota Defenders, the model used by security forces in Tanzania.</p> <p>Witnesses at the Vitongoji Primary School polling place in Vitongoji town, Chake Chake district, Pemba, said that at about 1 a.m. on October 27, policemen believed to be part of the anti-riot Field Force Unit, based on their green uniforms, killed Mohammed Khalfan Mjaka, 35, and injured a 30-year-old man in the leg. The policemen shot Mjaka about six times in his chest, they said.</p> <p>The security forces’ violence continued into the morning. At 10 a.m. on October 27, police shot and killed Salum Ali Abdalla, 38, at his neighbor’s shop near his home in Kipangani neighborhood, Wete. A witness said that Abdalla tried to flee when two policemen stormed the shop. One of them shot him in the back as he ran and then attempted to conceal the evidence by rubbing dirt over the bloodstains on the ground. The policemen drove off with his body, which was eventually taken to Wete Hospital.</p> <p>Two people, including a close friend of Hamad Shehe Ali, 35, witnessed his killing in Konde, Micheweni district, northern Pemba. On the evening of October 27, hooded, uniformed, and armed men, traveling in a fast-moving convoy of unmarked cars led by a police car and a Vikosi truck, shot their guns, causing people to run and hide. One bullet hit Ali, who was on his way with two other people, to Konde Primary School, a polling place, in the chest. A close friend who was with him said that onlookers carried Hamad to Wete Hospital, where he died.</p> <p>In Garagara, Said Makame Ali, 18, left his relatives’ home at around 9:30 a.m. on October 28 to walk to the town center with one of his cousins. They encountered uniformed men clashing with people and firing teargas who chased them, the cousin said:</p> <p>There was a wall we had to jump but Said couldn’t jump. That’s how they caught him. While he was trying to go over the wall, he was hit by a bullet. It was only one bullet. I saw him clutching his leg in agony.</p> <p>Ali’s cousin escaped, but his family was only able to locate Ali’s body three days later at the Mnazi Mmoja Hospital morgue. Another relative said he observed the injury on Ali’s leg and his body was still bleeding when they found him.</p> <p>On October 29, at about 9:15 a.m., assailants shot Mussa Haji Mussa, 28, four times – in the chest, both shoulders, and one leg – outside his home in Nungwi. Family members took Mussa to the nearby hospital, but he was dead on arrival. One relative said Mussa had been sick at the time and would have been resting inside his home. He believes the assailants were government-affiliated security forces and had dragged Mussa from his house, then shot him.</p> <p>Mussa’s family reported the matter to the police who, possibly fearing a riot, provided security at his burial. However, the authorities have not provided updates about any investigation into his killing in the year since.</p> <p>After the elections, the security forces maintained their presence in most of the areas where abuses had occurred and continued to intimidate residents.</p> <p>On November 11 security forces with the Kikosi cha Valantia Zanzibar (KVZ) division of the Vikosi shot Said Salum Suleiman, 34, on a street in Mwembe Makumbi neighborhood, Zanzibar City, as he transported sand in a donkey cart with his brother. Suleiman’s brother described their encounter with six officers before Suleiman’s death:</p> <p>It was me who was negotiating with them. It was then that Said joined the conversation. They tried to stop Said from joining, but he said he was going to join to see what was happening to his brother. One of them said, “I will shoot you. Don’t come this way.” But he still insisted on following me. [The officer] just shot the bullet and hit him in the stomach, right on the navel. He died instantly.</p> <p>Suleiman’s family later heard that the officer who shot him was arrested and taken to court, but they have not received further information about the proceedings or been called to testify.</p> <p>Torture of Detainees</p> <p>Three former detainees told Human Rights Watch that on October 26, hooded, armed men dragged them from their homes, blindfolded them, beat them, and drove them for about 30 minutes to a house. They were kept in a room there, regularly beaten, and warned to “stay out of politics.”</p> <p>“The system was that before a meal, we were beaten, then provided with a meal,” a former detainee said. “They mostly used wires and hammers. We were hit with hammers on the joints.”</p> <p>Six days before their release, the beatings stopped and officials wearing prison guard uniforms brought doctors who treated the victims. By November 15, 19 days after their abductions, all the men, except Ameir Ameir Soud, were blindfolded and dumped in different locations.</p> <p>Soud, a 72-year-old well-known political commentator and government critic in Bwejuju, Unguja, was abducted while he was alone at home, his wife said.</p> <p>A fellow detainee said that during their detention, Soud was taken to a torture room and never returned. Twenty-four days after Soud’s abduction, his family learned he had been dumped at Madema police station, in Zanzibar City, found him, and transferred him to a nearby hospital. His wife said:</p> <p>He was in a very bad condition. His legs were not functioning. He had eye problems. He was weak. He told me that he was tortured. He said it was a terrible situation. I couldn’t ask more.</p> <p>He died days later, on November 24, 2020, in a hospital.</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>To end the cycles of election-related violence in Zanzibar:</p> <p>Authorities in Tanzania and Zanzibar, including the Tanzania Police Force and the SMZ special departments, should identify and dismantle any structures that enable government-allied militias to operate in Zanzibar, and close all unofficial places of detention; and</p> <p>The governments of Tanzania and Zanzibar should demobilize all existing irregular security militias, including the Mazombi.</p> <p>The international community, including partners of Tanzania, as well as the African Union and its human rights experts, should urge the Tanzanian authorities to:</p>",2

He was charged in July in 3rd District Court with rape, a first-degree felony.</p> <p>Bizarro met a 19-year-old woman outside of his bar in March and invited her in for food. He then offered the woman alcohol even though she was only 19, according to charging documents.</p> <p>The woman said she doesn’t remember much of what happened next.</p> <p>“(Her) next clear memory is waking up next to Bizarro at about 4 a.m. at a hotel in Salt Lake County,” the charges state. “Bizarro texted (her) the next morning and advised her to use day-after contraceptive.”</p> <p>Police reviewed video surveillance from the hotel and found images of Bizarro and the woman arriving about 1 a.m. The woman was “swaying and using a counter for balance,” according to the charges. At 3:15 a.m., the video recorded the woman “trying to get away from Bizarro” and Bizarro trying to pull her back into an elevator.</p> <p>Detectives said the woman had a “significant” blood alcohol level when she was tested, even hours after her last drink. Police say in charging documents that the surveillance video and toxicology results “show the the victim was too impaired to consent” to sex.</p> <p>The incident happened while Bizarro was out on bail on charges accusing him of sexually abusing female workers at his bar. The charges were filed in 2018 based on a 2014 incident. As of Friday, that case was still ongoing. The 2018 charges were based on when Bizarro was the owner of the Moose Lounge, 180 W. 400 South. Bizarro no longer owns the bar which has since changed its name and is under new ownership.</p> <p>Prosecutors have requested Bizarro now be held without bail.</p>",2

Ontario court Judge Richard Blouin found them guilty last year, saying the case against them was overwhelming.</p> <p>“Mr. Sears,” Blouin said, “promoted hate to a vast audience in an era where online exposure to this material inexorably leads to extremism and the potential of mass casualties.”</p> <p>Sears, 57, who described himself as “halfway between a lawyer and an actor who portrays a lawyer on TV,” is handling the appeal himself before Superior Court Justice Peter Cavanagh.</p> <p>Embry has maintained he did his best to provide effective, professional counsel. While he considered Sears's views about the Holocaust to be indefensible and vehemently disagreed with much of his client's thinking, court heard, he believed they had a shot at raising a doubt about whether the accused had been promoting hate with the publication.</p> <p>During his evidence, Sears said he repeatedly urged Embry to call witnesses in an effort to undermine the testimony of the prosecution's two experts on anti-Semitism and misogyny. Embry, however, was adamantly opposed.</p> <p>“I said we should leave nothing on the table and lead our own experts,” Sears said. “He thought again it would piss off Blouin.”</p> <p>Sears, who fired Embry after the guilty verdict, said he felt stuck with the lawyer whom he described as honest and a good person.</p> <p>In cross-examination, Crown lawyer Michael Bernstein suggested a lawyer has an obligation to pick an approach, prompting Sears to retort it was an incompetent strategy.</p> <p>“Mr. Embry acted at all times professionally and competently,” Bernstein said.</p> <p>“We agree to disagree.”</p> <p>Bernstein produced a series of emails about planned closing submissions in which Sears praised his lawyer for having done a “really good job” and telling him, “I do trust you as much as a I trust anyone who isn't me.” At the same time, Sears insisted Embry not say anything in “Your Ward News” was false.</p> <p>“I gave him the big thumb's up. That's correct,” Sears said. “I didn't want this, but I acquiesced to it. I wanted to present a full defence.”</p> <p>“You did a lot more than acquiesce,” Bernstein said, quoting Sears at one point as telling Embry: “You're looking good. We're going to get acquitted.”</p> <p>“At the time, I didn't think he was incompetent but I had doubts,” Sears, who chose not to testify at his trial, explained of another email.</p> <p>Embry said in an affidavit he had urged his client to take the stand but couldn't persuade him. He also rejected many of his client's strategy suggestions because he thought they would backfire.</p> <p>Blouin last year handed Sears, who was granted bail pending appeal, the maximum one-year jail sentence, saying he would have given longer had the law allowed. St. Germaine was given 12 months strict house arrest.</p> <p>The appeal is expected to continue on Thursday.</p> <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published on Nov. 10, 2020.</p>",2
1032642855,"Government clamps down on ivermectin, hides drug’s benefits from public in latest example of blatant medical murder",2022-03-08 00:00:00,"<p>(Natural News) “The HighWire” host Del Bigtree and guest Tess Lawrie talked about why there is little news about the controversial drug ivermectin.</p> <p>“For me, ivermectin is actually the key to unlocking all the secrets of this pandemic,” Lawrie said during the March 4 episode of “The HighWire.” “There would have been no lockdowns, there would have been no masking or any of that necessary because ivermectin is really good at reducing transmission.”</p> <p>In the last two years, the government and mainstream media clamped down on ivermectin, which has been called a “miracle cure” against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). Big Pharma and the government shut it down in favor of dangerous, untested vaccines.</p> <p>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci is one of the big players in flushing ivermectin out of the radar.</p> <p>Lawrie, a bioethics specialist and research consultant, shared her concern about the lack of evidence to support the strategies that the authorities are recommending to mitigate COVID-19.</p> <p>Pierre Kory, president of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC Alliance), testified at a Senate hearing in December 2020 about looking into early outpatient COVID-19 treatment using the already expansive and still rapidly emerging medical evidence on ivermectin.</p> <p>“We have evidence that ivermectin is effective, not only in prophylaxis, in the prevention. If you take it you will not get sick,” he said, adding that the drug has immense and potent antiviral activity.</p> <p>Data showed that ivermectin was able to prevent COVID-19 and keep early symptoms from progressing to the hyper-inflammatory phase, and can even help critically ill patients to recover.</p> <p>Kory said at the time that doctors trying to save lives considered the lack of governmental guidance and research on effective early home preventive treatments unconscionable, considering that hospitals have been overflowing with patients.</p> <p>Ivermectin should be used for both COVID prevention and treatment</p> <p>Lawrie herself said that it was clear ivermectin was likely a game-changer that should be used for both prevention and treatment. (Related: Japanese study finds that ivermectin is “safe and effective” for treating covid.)</p> <p>Moreover, ivermectin was on the World Health Organization‘s (WHO) list as an essential medicine. In reports, ivermectin was shown to reduce inflammation and speed up viral clearance, so it can get rid of viruses quickly. In studies with severe infection, there was a 75 percent reduction in mortality in ivermectin users.</p> <p>But instead of promoting something that seemed to be showing a lot of success, the government with the help of a non-governmental organization that collaborated with the WHO, influenced the conclusion of the studies involving ivermectin.</p> <p>In the U.S., the use of ivermectin can take away a doctor’s license. It has become a sort of flashpoint in people’s lives, and the government wants them to agree to defer using it as treatment, essentially destroying ivermectin. (Related: Secret documents reveal FDA’s attack on Ivermectin.)</p> <p>“So there would have been no emergency use authorization of experimental novel treatments. And that includes the new gene-based vaccines. So, if you want to understand what COVID is all about, then you’ve got to start with ivermectin. And that really unlocks the whole mystery.”</p> <p>Bigtree added: “We’re going to need an investigation into what to me could lead to crimes against humanity, there was a known solution, a miracle drug if you will, that could have saved millions of lives. And it was purposely stopped by some group of people or health departments, then we’ve really got to question the motives there.”</p> <p>More related stories:</p> <p>Oklahoma AG declares medical boards cannot punish doctors for prescribing ivermectin.</p> <p>Medical deep state continues to lie about ivermectin.</p> <p>“Ivermectin” is the word that shall not be uttered in the Australian parliament.</p> <p>Study finds preventive use of ivermectin reduces COVID deaths by 90 PERCENT.</p> <p>Royal hypocrisy: Queen Elizabeth of England has COVID and she’s reportedly taking ivermectin to treat it.</p> <p>Watch below the full March 4 episode of “The HighWire” with Del Bigtree to learn more about ivermectin censorship.</p> <p>This video is from The HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.</p> <p>Sources include:</p> <p>Brighteon.com</p> <p>NewsWise.com</p>",2
964745092,Confronting the scourge of persecution by prosecution,2021-01-17 00:00:00,"<p>BY NIGEL NYAMUTUMBU</p> <p>One of the most topical debates in national discourses in Zimbabwe over the last week has been around mechanisms to address and regulate the dissemination of false information and disinformation, in light of the arrests of journalist Hopewell Chin’ono and opposition political officials Job Sikhala and Fadzayi Mahere.</p> <p>The trio’s alleged crime was that of publishing a falsehood or communicating false information prejudicial to the state.</p> <p>This purported offence is drawn from Section 31 (a) (iii) of the Criminal (Codification and Reform) Act, a part of the law which in all intents and purpose doesn’t only no longer exists in our statutes by virtue of a Constitutional Court ruling, but is also not in sync with the government’s law reform agenda that has, among other developments, repealed repressive legislation such as the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Aippa).</p> <p>There have been several articulate submissions around the illegality of the law used to arrest the trio, centered on the precedence set by the Constitutional Court in the ruling against criminal defamation and indeed the principle that no law, including the constitution, which is the supreme law can resurrect statutes that no longer exists.</p> <p>One doesn’t need to be a lawyer or constitutional expert to appreciate that even if provisions of a repealed law are in sync with the new law, those former statutes don’t automatically become effective unless and until the provisions are enacted through the recognised law-making processes.</p> <p>The arguments, therefore, that the law was resurrected by way of the general amendments are illegitimate.</p> <p>To use the repealed Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Aippa) as an example, a general amendment of the title of an officer of say the Zimbabwe Media Commission (ZMC) for all statutes cannot in any way suggest that the repealed law has been reinstated and is effective.</p> <p>It is an unsustainable argument that only suggests a leopard doesn’t change its spots and the regime of the so-called second republic is not any different from the first.</p> <p>Beyond the submissions on the illegality of the law and therefore arrests, there have been suggestions that the trio had a case to answer before the country’s judiciary as a way of holding peddlers of false information and misinformation accountable.</p> <p>To put things into context, the trio recirculated a video that went viral on social media in which a police officer is seen quarrelling amid pushing and shoving among a group of people that audibly accused this police officer of striking and killing a baby with a baton stick.</p> <p>In the same visuals, an actively involved woman holding a baby — who at that time was reported to be the mother of the “dead” baby — is also seen grabbing the policeman.</p> <p>Chin’ono who uses his social media handles as a source for verified and legitimate news and information, being an internationally acclaimed journalist, posted the video, disapproving of the wanton act of violence that the citizens in the video were audibly complaining of and in the process reported the case of the child having been “killed” as fact.</p> <p>Sikhala and Mahere, who by virtue of being in the opposition posit themselves as alternative leaders raised concern at the treatment of citizens by the police, more so that the violence against citizens had led to the “death” of an innocent child.</p> <p>Thousands of social media users within and outside Zimbabwe also weighed in the condemnation with the narrative that there had been a baby that had lost their life on account of a brutal police force trending.</p> <p>Zimbabwe would need to build new prisons if the country were to accommodate those that could have been arrested on the same account as the three high profile figures incarcerated for commenting and recirculating a trending video and subsequent narrative.</p> <p>To their credit, police in response to the trending video, initiated an inquiry into what had obtained with their investigations, revealing that there had been a scuffle between a police officer and members of the public after the officer in question had shattered a windscreen of a commuter omnibus with a baton, resulting in the baby being hit by debris.</p> <p>However, and perhaps a critical fact according to the police investigation, the baby did not die as those in the video suggested and as the trio and many others widely circulated.</p> <p>The police’s role should have started and ended there.</p> <p>To then go on and make an arrest, not on account of the investigation but to punish those that had circulated the information that gave you the lead, is not only unfair but outrageous.</p> <p>What made the police investigation, report and subsequent action even more interesting is how the narrative of the mother of the baby in a later interview with the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation Television (ZBC TV) differs from the police statement.</p> <p>The consistent fact revolved around that the baby is alive and well, which seems to be the state’s main contention.</p> <p>It is given that the police report and account by the mother, social media users, including the trio circulated information that was not entirely true.</p> <p>It is also given that in this digital age, misinformation and fake information is a challenge that will need multifaceted interventions to address.</p> <p>Arresting citizens, dissenting voices and opposition leaders is certainly not one of the ways to curd disinformation.</p> <p>The state cannot purport to hold and monitor the truth.</p> <p>It is tantamount to criminalising freedom of expression and it is an unsustainable way of regulating or promoting ethical practices on the internet when it comes to the dissemination of news and information.</p> <p>As highlighted earlier, it was going to be impractical for the state to prosecute all those that recirculated, commented or reacted to the video that missed critical facts.</p> <p>It is actually telling in the persons that were arrested that this was actual fact targeted at journalists and activists.</p> <p>This is not to say, especially from a journalistic perspective that the media cannot be held accountable.</p> <p>It is to this end that the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe (MAZ) and its partners, among them the press council, journalists’ union, editors’ forum and the Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa Zimbabwe), are consulting on a Media Practitioners law that read together with the soon-to-be-enacted Zimbabwe Media Commission Bill will provide a framework for co-regulation of the media premised on a binding code of conduct.</p> <p>l Nigel Nyamutumbu is a media development practitioner currently serving as the programmes manager for the Media Alliance

It also presents the view of the oil and gas industry about plastic.</p> <p>In making the documentary, Schlosberg shot in countries across the globe, including Indonesia.</p> <p>Aside from having problems related to waste management, Indonesia is described as a country that has human resources to deal with the problem of waste, including plastic.</p> <p>While in Indonesia, Schlosberg – who won an Emmy Award for her documentary Backyard – collected footage of Jakarta’s Ciliwung River, the Bantar Gebang dumpsite in Bekasi, West Java, and street rallies in East Java against diaper pollution in the Brantas River.</p> <p>“The film introduces viewers to solutions and the global resistance and network of international heroes working to combat this urgent problem, including Capt. Charlie Moore [Algalita Marine Research & Education] who discovered the North Pacific Garbage Patch,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Jakarta Post.</p> <p>The documentary is a collaborative effort between The Story Of Stuff Project and React To Film. It also reveals the shocking agenda of the oil and gas industry, which dramatically increased plastic production across the world.</p> <p>“Driven by cheap American shale gas, the plastic industry is aggressively investing to produce more single-use plastic, with devastating consequences for marginalized communities and the environment. As much as the plastic producers would like to put the responsibility on consumers, plastic production and pollution is not about demand, it’s about supply, and the supply is exploding. The Story of Plastic will not only change viewers’ lives, it will fuel a worldwide movement,” Wilson said.</p> <p>The production of the film also involved Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready as music director. “We promise, you’ll never look at plastic the same way again,” Wilson added.</p> <p>Schlosberg stole media attention in October 2016 when she was arrested and charged with criminal offenses for filming the #ShutItDown protest in North Dakota.</p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> <p>Schlosberg produced Josh Fox’s climate change film How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change (Sundance/HBO).

Seated directly behind Trump in the House chamber, Pelosi marked the end of the address by theatrically tearing her copy of his remarks, dramatizing the bitter gulf between the two sides as this year’s presidential and congressional election campaigns commence.</p> <p>Democrats won House control in 2018 by lambasting unsuccessful efforts by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law. Democrats say they will concentrate on health care in this year’s campaign as well, including opposing an administration-backed federal lawsuit aimed at declaring Obama’s statute unconstitutional.</p> <p>Trump’s impeachment has dominated Washington since the fall. In a remarkable confluence of events, the GOP-run Senate was set to acquit him Wednesday, less than 24 hours after his address.</p> <p>“As we witness the impeachment process in Washington there are some things each of us, no matter our party, should demand,“ Whitmer said. “The truth matters. Facts matter. And no one should be above the law.”</p> <p>Democrats’ selection of Whitmer, 48, underscored their determination to improve their performance in the Midwest in November’s elections.</p> <p>Trump captured Michigan in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes by appealing to lower-earning workers, winning a state that hadn’t voted for the GOP presidential candidate since 1988. Trump also won over enough working-class white voters to score slender victories in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and to win Ohio handily.</p> <p>Reaching out to those voters, Whitmer acknowledged their struggles to afford transportation, student loans and prescription drugs.</p> <p>“Michigan invented the middle class,“ she said. “So, we know if the economy doesn’t work for working people, it just doesn’t work.”</p> <p>Whitmer’s prominent role also highlighted her party’s outreach to women, who’ve soured on Trump’s belligerent style and whose growing support helped Democrats make big gains in suburban districts in 2018.</p> <p>Whitmer was elected governor easily that year over a Trump-backed Republican, and she’s been mentioned as a potential vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>In Democrats’ Spanish-language response, freshman Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar focused on health care and workers’ struggles to get by.</p> <p>Speaking from a community centre in her home town of El Paso near the Mexican border, Escobar also described last August’s mass killing there by a shooter she said “used hateful language like the very words used by President Trump to describe immigrants and Latinos.“</p> <p>Escobar also touched on Trump’s impeachment, saying that he’d jeopardized the next election and threatened national security with his efforts to pressure Ukraine, an ally fighting Russian-backed insurgents, to produce damaging information on political rival Joe Biden.</p> <p>“We Democrats will continue to fight for truth and for what is right. No one is above the law,“ Escobar said.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Associated Press writer Cedar Attanasio in El Paso, Texas, contributed to this report.</p> <p>SHARE:</p>",2

920753473,Wednesday briefing: Job furloughs 'risk slide into mass redundancies',2020-04-29 00:00:00,"<p>Top story: Call to extend job retention scheme</p> <p>Hello, Warren Murray with you once again this morning. Let’s set the controls for the heart of the news …</p> <p>The UK government’s plan to subsidise workers’ wages should be extended until at least autumn, the trade body for the human resources sector has argued. Peter Cheese from the CIPD said extending the scheme until at least September would prevent the job retention scheme becoming a “waiting room” for eventual redundancy. The CIPD is calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for urgent changes including allowing furloughed staff to work reduced hours. There are early signs the furlough scheme is working, with more than 4m positions protected following the first week of its operation. Extending it could add £12bn a month to the cost to the exchequer, according to the Resolution Foundation.</p> <p>British Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel. Its chief executive, Alex Cruz, has told the airline’s 42,000 staff that it “must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future”. The UK’s flag carrier has placed 22,600 people on the government’s furlough scheme and the CEO wrote to staff that it “cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely … Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300.” Unions have reacted with shock and anger to the announcement.</p> <p>The number of US cases has passed one million as Donald Trump predicted an economic rebound in the fall and claimed there would soon be 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day. An international row has erupted as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed calls for an investigation of the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus. The Chinese government has responded by blasting out belittling messages about “panda bashing” and “victim blaming” by Australia.

994090353,Government To Pay Nearly $7 Million To Resolve Sexual Abuse Cases At Leavenworth VA,2021-07-08 00:00:00,"<p>The federal government has agreed to pay nearly $7 million to settle eight cases stemming from the sexual abuse of veterans by a former physician assistant at the VA Hospital in Leavenworth, Kansas.</p> <p>The settlement comes after three veterans took their cases to trial last year, resulting in hefty damage awards against the government.</p> <p>“We just didn’t give up,” said attorney Danny Thomas, who represented the veterans. “The Department of Justice fought these cases tooth and nail for years. They treated these veterans like dirt. They accused them of lying, they attacked their character in court and in pleadings. And we just weren’t going to stand for it.”</p> <p>The plaintiffs, all of them veterans of the Iraq or Afghanistan conflicts, alleged they were subjected to unnecessary genital exams and other physical abuse by Mark Wisner, who was a physician assistant at the Dwight D. Eisenhower VA Medical Center from 2008 to 2014.</p> <p>Wisner is thought to have abused as many as 100 military veterans, which would make the episode the largest sexual abuse scandal in the history of the VA.</p> <p>More than 80 veterans represented by other lawyers settled their lawsuits against the government for $6.7 million in 2019.</p> <p>“We were able to do better than that just for our eight clients alone,” Thomas said.</p> <p>Together with the latest settlement and the cases that went to trial, the government will have paid out nearly $17 million in claims over the scandal.</p> <p>Holding the government responsible</p> <p>Wisner was convicted of aggravated sexual battery and related charges in 2017 and sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison. He surrendered his license to the Kansas Board of Healing Arts in February 2015.</p> <p>Terms of the new settlement call for the eight veterans to receive amounts ranging from $706,250 to $1,406,250, Thomas said.</p> <p>In court documents, the veterans are referred to by the fictitious name John Doe since their cases involved sexual abuse.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>As part of the settlement, the government will drop its appeals of the cases that went to trial, Thomas said.</p> <p>Those cases were tried before U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree, who awarded one veteran $538,000, another veteran $1.5 million and the third veteran more than $1 million.</p> <p>The awards, along with a change in Justice Department personnel under the Biden administration, appear to have spurred the government to resolve the remaining cases rather than risk the prospect of additional damage awards.</p> <p>Thomas, who has been battling the government for more than four years, was highly critical of U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, whom he accused of “not lifting a finger” for the veterans.</p> <p>He said Moran, ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, never asked for an investigation of what happened at the Leavenworth VA or inquired about the veterans’ well-being.</p> <p>Asked to respond, Moran's office said that Moran had raised concerns about the allegations against Wisner with then-VA Secretary Robert McDonald in 2016 and later publicly questioned him about them.</p> <p>His office also noted that he had introduced the Accountability to Safeguard Veterans from Violent Crimes Act of 2016 to reduce pensions earned by certain VA hospital employees convicted of violent crimes.</p> <p>Although the government never disputed that Wisner sexually molested the veterans, it contended it was not liable for his conduct because it occurred outside the scope of Wisner's employment.</p> <p>“This obviously wasn’t just about the money,” Thomas said. “It was about doing justice for these guys and making sure their voices were heard.”</p> <p>Copyright 2021 KCUR 89.3.

900514048,Translator working for German military arrested for spying for Iran,2020-01-21 13:00:52,"<p>German authorities have arrested a former translator and cultural advisor for the German military, accusing him of spying for Iranian intelligence. The 51-year old man, who has been identified only as Abdul S., was arrested along with his wife and charged with treason and with breaching official secrecy laws in 18 cases.</p> <p>The accused is a dual German-Afghan citizen. The prosecution has revealed very little of its case thus far. Reporters and media were barred from the courtroom when the accused was being indicted in Koblenz’s state court.</p> <p>The trial is being held behind closed doors because of security concerns, Judge Thomas Bergmann stated. The trial is expected to last through March.</p> <p>The accused’s wife, identified only as Asiea S., is also a dual German-Afghan citizen. She has been charged with being an accessory to treason. Prosecutors have said that she supported his passing of secret documents to Iran from the beginning, without detailing the nature of that support. Her trial will take place in March.</p> <p>Abdul S. faces life in prison if he is found guilty of the charges; however, that normally means he’d have to serve at least 15 years. His wife faces a maximum of 11 years.</p> <p>It was revealed in court documents that “Abdul S. is strongly suspected of abusing his position as a civilian employee of the Bundeswehr to pass on military state secrets to a member of the Iranian secret service.”</p> <p>He was arrested in January of 2019 after informants overseas tipped off German authorities of his alleged spying. The Germans set up a trap for Abdul S. and once he took the bait, he was taken into custody; he is being held ever since.</p> <p>Abdul had worked for several years at the Heinrich-Hertz barracks in the town of Daun, in the Eifel region of western Germany near Koblenz.</p> <p>He isn’t the only Iranian agent that the German authorities have uncovered: In 2018, German authorities arrested a Vienna-based Iranian diplomat suspected of espionage. Prosecutors alleged that he was plotting, along with a Belgium-based couple, to plant a bomb at an Iranian opposition rally in Paris.</p> <p>Germany’s BfV, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (German: Bundesamt für Verfassungsschut), a domestic intelligence agency, has identified Iran as one of the countries most active in spying on Germany, along with China and Russia. In a published report, the BfV said that Iranian spy services “are regularly looking for appropriate sources to cover the information needs of the regime.”</p> <p>The BfV has been rocked by scandals almost since its inception.

In his speech at the foot of Chino Roces (formerly Mendiola), Espina lamented that of the 187 media killings since 1986, only 17 had convictions.</p> <p>Lawyer of the families of the victims Nena Santos earlier told the media she is confident that a guilty verdict would be handed down by the Quezon City local court. The promulgation of the case has been reset to Dec. 20 this year.</p> <p>In a statement, Altermidya- People’s Alternative Media Network says anything less than conviction of the Ampatuan is “unacceptable.”</p> <p>“The delivery of justice for Ampatuan Massacre victims will act like a beam of light shone into a great darkness that is the escalating climate of fear and impunity under the Duterte administration,” the group said.</p> <p>In a separate statement, the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (Focap) maintained that “convictions of the perpetrators and full recompense of the victims’ families will be a first step in reversing the long and tragic injustice.”</p> <p>The Ampatuan massacre is considered as the single biggest attack on journalists and the worst election-related violence in Philippine history. The 58 victims were part of a convoy that would file the candidacy of Esmael Mangudadatu.

The three police officers responsible — Jon Mattingly, Myles Cosgrove, and Brett Hankison — have yet to be arrested. At the end of May, the FBI reopened the investigation into her death, but protestors have been on the ground since demanding justice for Taylor. The Louisville Bail Fund was created to help bail out those who took to the streets following Taylor’s killing. It was created by Black Lives Matter Louisville, and while it is nationally connected to similar networks, the fund is entirely community driven.</p> <p>Several organizations have taken the initiative to help rebuild Minneapolis amid the massive protests that followed George Floyd’s murder this May. We Love Lake Street is a nonprofit dedicated to restoring the storefronts and businesses damaged by looters during the early phases of protesting; their mission is made more important by the fact that many businesses on Lake Street in Minneapolis are owned by immigrants and people of color.</p> <p>Like Lake Street, several businesses in North Minneapolis have been impacted by vandalism and arson. The West Broadway Business and Area Coalition, in collaboration with Northside Funders Group, are now redirecting their donations to aid these northside businesses.</p> <p>Black Visions Collective (BLVC) is a Minnesota-based organization whose mission is to organize and build a powerful collection of Black communities to dismantle systems of violence and racism. BLVC is dedicated to Black liberation and collective liberation, and integrates healing justice into all of their campaigns and leadership programs.</p> <p>Gays and Lesbians Living in a Transgender Society (G.L.I.T.S) approaches the health and rights crisis faced by transgender sex workers holistically. They apply a harm reduction approach whilie fighting for economic and social justice for trans sex workers. G.L.I.T.S. provides low-cost health care, safe sex supplies, and stable housing to their clientele while helping to fight the stigmatization of transgender sex workers. \</p> <p>Four Black and Trans led organizations in New York City — BTFA Collective, The Black Trans Travel Fund, For the Gworls, and The Okra Project — have banded together to raise money for what they’re calling the Black Trans Protestors Emergency Fund, to aid demonstrators in New York and across the country. They plan to redistribute donations to purchase resources and necessary medical care for demonstrators on the ground.</p> <p>The Emergency Release Fund NYC is a bail fund specifically for trans people, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the fund has extended their resources to all LGBTQ+ people. As of June 25, the fund says they have helped to free 205 individuals since it was founded in August 2019, totaling over $1.5 million in bail posted. As a part of the National Bail Fund Network, a nationwide collective of over 60 bail funds, the Emergency Release Fund also provides financial help towards immigration bonds for LGBTQ+ detainees.</p> <p>TGI Justice Project is a group of transgender, gender variant, and intersex people fighting against imprisonment, police violence, racism, poverty, and other human rights injustices experienced by Black and brown trans people. While the group’s mission is to abolish the U.S. incarceration system, TGI Justice Project focuses its efforts primarily on those who have experienced incarceration in the California system by providing legal support and re-entry programs. They are predominantly staffed by low-income transgender women of color (and their families) who are in prison, formerly incarcerated, or targeted by the police, as is so often the case for Black trans people in the U.S.</p> <p>The Trans Justice Funding Project is a funding initiative founded to support grassroots, trans-specific justice groups run by and for trans people. These groups include organizations fighting to eradicate prison systems and provide legal protections for trans people, organizations that provide health and wellness to the community, and organizations providing housing for trans people.

949116501,Several hundred arrests amid protest calls in Egypt: rights group,2020-09-28 00:00:00,"<p>CAIRO (Reuters) – Egyptian authorities have detained at least 382 people since Sept. 20 amid reports of small, scattered demonstrations against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a rights group said on Monday.</p> <p>The interior ministry could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>The arrests come after security measures were tightened around the first anniversary of rare demonstrations in Cairo and other cities, triggered by appeals in September last year from an exiled former contractor and actor, Mohamed Ali.</p> <p>Ali, who had posted videos online lambasting the authorities, called for more protests this month.</p> <p>Videos posted on social media since Sept. 20 appeared to show several very small demonstrations involving up to several dozen people in different parts of the country.</p> <p>Reuters could not independently verify the videos, but security sources confirmed some small and scattered protests on Friday, which they said were mainly in villages and outside big cities.</p> <p>In one case, a witness said about 100 men had gathered in an area outside the city of Damietta and chanted “Leave, Sisi”.</p> <p>The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms said it had directly documented 249 detentions over the past nine days, while it said another 133 had been documented by other rights groups or lawyers.</p> <p>The public prosecutor’s office said on Sunday it had ordered the release of 68 minors detained for their alleged participation in “recent riots”. It did not mention other arrests.</p> <p>Security forces can be seen deployed in public spaces especially on Fridays, and there have been increased security checks.</p> <p>The protests are partly fuelled by economic frustrations made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, and by a major government campaign to impose fines or demolitions on unlicensed housing, activists say.</p> <p>In an apparent reference to the protests, Sisi praised Egyptians for enduring tough economic conditions on Sunday and said some were trying to exploit Egypt’s challenges to undermine the country but would not succeed.</p> <p>“They choose the difficult conditions to offend and sow suspicion among Egyptians about what we are doing – that this is at their expense and against them,” Sisi said during the inauguration of a petrochemical plant.</p> <p>“The people and the state are one entity. Nobody intervenes between us and nobody will be able to intervene between us.”</p> <p>Since his election in 2014 Sisi has overseen a broad crackdown on political dissent, which was extended with a wave of arrests after the protests last September.</p> <p>Sisi says the government is looking after human rights by working to provide basic needs such as jobs and housing.</p> <p>At the inauguration, a video on human rights was played that said the “safety and stability” of Egypt was one of the most important rights of its people.</p> <p>(Editing by Giles Elgood)</p>",2

Lopez Obrador touted the program as a way to help the US regulate migration. The US “is looking for alternatives because migration is out of control,” Lopez Obrador said. “Instead of seeking to block it with punitive measures, it should be channeled and ordered.”</p> <p>UNITED STATES</p> <p>Black Sea warning issued</p> <p>The Department of State on Monday branded as an “unprovoked escalation” reported Russian plans to block parts of the Black Sea, which could affect access to Ukrainian ports. Russian state media have reported that Moscow intends to close parts of the Black Sea to foreign military and official ships for six months. Such a move could affect access to Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov, which is connected to the Black Sea through the Kerch Strait, on the eastern tip of the Crimean Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. “This represents yet another unprovoked escalation in Moscow’s ongoing campaign to undermine and destabilize Ukraine,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.</p> <p>UNITED STATES</p> <p>Drugmakers go on trial</p> <p>Four drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson, on Monday went on trial over claims that they helped fuel an opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing that downplayed the risks of addiction. Johnson & Johnson, Teva, Endo and Allergan are accused of trivializing the dangers of long-term use of opioid painkillers to boost sales in a lawsuit filed by several California counties and the city of Oakland. The complaint seeks billions of dollars in damages to abate the public nuisance it says the drugmakers created.</p> <p>UNITED STATES</p> <p>Activist sues Twitter</p> <p>Project Veritas frontman James O’Keefe on Monday sued Twitter Inc for defamation for banning him from the Internet platform. O’Keefe sued in state court in Westchester County, New York, where Project Veritas does business, claiming that the social media company falsely banned him for operating fake accounts. “After suspending Mr O’Keefe’s personal Twitter account on April 15, Twitter, through an unnamed spokesperson, disseminated to media outlets the provably false statement that Mr O’Keefe was ‘operating fake [Twitter] accounts,’” he said in a complaint.</p> <p>UNITED STATES</p> <p>Bathroom bill approved</p> <p>Tennessee House lawmakers on Monday passed a bill that would put public schools and districts at risk of civil lawsuits if they let transgender students or employees use multiperson bathrooms or locker rooms that are not for their gender. The proposal must now pass the Senate before it can head to Tennessee Governor Bill Lee’s desk, with senators expected to vote on the proposal later this week. Under the proposed measure, which passed 65-24, a student or employee could sue in an effort to claim monetary damages “for all psychological, emotional, and physical harm suffered” if school officials allow a transgender person into the bathroom or locker room when others are in there, or if they require staying in the same sleeping quarters as a member of the opposite sex at birth, unless that person is a family member.</p> <p>NEW ZEALAND</p> <p>Airport virus case confirmed</p> <p>Authorities yesterday said that an Auckland airport worker had tested positive for COVID-19, although Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it would not affect a newly opened travel bubble with Australia. Confirmation that a cleaner at the airport had contracted the virus came barely 24 hours after the transport hub hosted joyful scenes as families reunited following the launch of the quarantine-free bubble. Ardern said the cleaner worked on planes arriving from “red zone” countries deemed high risk, not Australia, which like New Zealand has largely contained the virus. She said the two nations expected to handle border cases, and had systems in place to do that without closing the long-awaited travel bubble. “We accept there will be cases and that is part of our journey together, for both sides,” she told reporters.</p> <p>CHINA</p> <p>Supercomputing hub coming</p> <p>The southern space port of Wenchang plans to invest 20 billion yuan (US$3.1 billion) to build a supercomputing center by the end of the year to analyze data obtained from space, the state-backed Hainan Daily said yesterday. The center would provide big data services for industries, including the aerospace and marine sectors, starting next year, the report said. The nation envisions having in the next decade massive constellations of commercial satellites that can offer services ranging from high-speed Internet for aircraft to tracking coal shipments. To meet the demand for satellite launches, it would have to build bigger rockets that can carry more satellites or build more launch sites, or both. The nation currently has four launch sites — three inland and one in Wenchang, Hainan Province. Earlier this month, the government said it was planning a new commercial space base in Hainan to meet growing demand for launches.</p> <p>SOUTH KOREA</p> <p>Protesters shave heads</p> <p>More than 30 college students yesterday shaved their heads in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul to protest Tokyo’s decision to release water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea. Police periodically dispersed crowds, who chanted and held placards, but did not stop the event from taking place, although there is a COVID-19 pandemic ban on gatherings larger than 10 people. The protesters who were shaved were draped in protective sheets emblazoned with messages condemning the Japanese plan and calling for it to be ditched. One read: “The Japanese government should immediately cancel the plan to release the contaminated water.” Tokyo last week said it would release more than 1 million tonnes of treated water from the Fukushima site in stages starting in about two years.</p> <p>UNITED KINGDOM</p> <p>‘Downton’ sequel coming</p> <p>Downton Abbey is to return in a sequel due to be released this Christmas, producers said. The first Downton Abbey film, based on the hugely popular British TV series, was released in 2019. Producers on Monday said that much of the original cast — including Maggie Smith, Hugh Bonneville, Laura Carmichael, Jim Carter, Michelle Dockery and Elizabeth McGovern — would return. They would be joined by new faces, with Hugh Dancy, Laura Haddock, Nathalie Baye and Dominic West making an appearance, the producers told USA Today. The movie, which began production last week, is set to be released on Dec. 22. The plot remains under wraps, but Julian Fellowes, the man behind the original script, has signed on to write the sequel’s screenplay.</p>",2
930157688,Should Images Of Protesters Be Blurred To Protect Them From Retribution?,2020-06-18 09:08:00,"<p>News consumers are asking NPR to obscure the faces of protesters who have not given their explicit consent to have their images published.</p> <p>These requests have come into the Public Editor inbox, and we've been tagged in conversations on social media. Newsrooms everywhere are facing similar requests.</p> <p>Vivien Manning wrote to us: ""Protesters across the country are risking their lives to fight against police brutality and murder. By posting photos that expose their faces and identities, you're putting individuals at risk of retaliation, both from racist people online and stronger governmental forces.""</p> <p>And Leah Block wrote: ""Do not forget the Ferguson protesters who died under ""mysterious circumstances"" — Deandre Joshua, Darren Seals, MarShawn McCarrel, Edward Crawford Jr., Danye Jones (whose mother was an active protester), and Bassem Masri. Their deaths were not coincidental.</p> <p>""I urge NPR to take down the photos of protesters or blur their likenesses entirely. Otherwise, make sure that you have the photo subjects' consents to post their photos and put them at risk, and preferably include a notice of this consent in all of your photo/video captions.""</p> <p>My answer comes in two parts. Part I: NPR should not institute a policy of obscuring the faces of people photographed while participating in public demonstrations who do not give express permission to have their picture published. NPR is committed to journalism, and that includes chronicling news as it happens and in public. And now, much of the day's events qualify as historic moments.</p> <p>Blurring images is a form of photo manipulation that makes them less true, and is generally an unacceptable practice for documentary photography. Photojournalists — and their news organizations — certainly can consider genuine concerns for the safety of a person in an image. But rather than default to altering the image, in the spirit of recording the truth of the circumstances, the journalist might first look for another image that conveys a comparable moment without jeopardizing an individual. The bar for manipulating a news photo is so incredibly high that I cannot remember an occasion when it was justified.</p> <p>Photojournalism often puts a face on the story and documents the circumstances. Blurring faces can erase the power of that work, as would selecting only images that do not contain identifiable faces. Protesters' faces communicate a range of emotions — joy, anger, sorrow. Without those emotions, the story would be incomplete and inadequate. Most — though I recognize that certainly not all — have chosen to be part of these protests fully aware they are entering a public space and at personal risk. The journalists' job is to convey reality.</p> <p>Think of the many historic images of protests and how they galvanized the general public. If we can't see their faces, we won't feel the full impact of what they are feeling or understand the truth of their circumstances. That's the power of a great photo.</p> <p>""The general public's opinions about protests and the social movements behind them are formed in large part by what they read or see in the media,"" wrote Danielle Kilgo, a researcher and an assistant professor of journalism at Indiana University, in a piece that argues that historically newsrooms have been less likely to legitimize anti-black racism protests.</p> <p>Photos and video are the most powerful tool in a storyteller's toolkit. On top of that, photos of protests are crucial for storytelling in the digital environment, said Keith Jenkins, NPR senior director of visuals.</p> <p>The vast majority of images that appear with NPR content come from The Associated Press or Getty Images, Jenkins said.</p> <p>Which brings me to part II of my answer to this concern. Protesters have the opportunity to stay out of the limelight. And photographers on the scenes of protest have opportunities to hear from protesters who would prefer not to be part of the story.</p> <p>While some journalists dismiss the fear of harm to the subjects, I find the concern valid. Protesters can get fired, or charged with crimes. While the prospect of racists hunting protesters down is alarming, it seems more likely that social media, not journalistic photos, would be the starting point.</p> <p>But after talking to a photo editor from an international wire service, it's clear that photographers don't want to thoughtlessly publish photos of unwilling subjects.</p> <p>Photographers working for all the wire services and photo agencies that NPR uses are instructed to identify themselves and ask for names, whenever possible, particularly if there are fewer than three people in a photo, an editor for one of those wire services told me. He asked that I not name him or the wire service, because he has staff in harm's way all around the world and occasionally hostile governments will use his words against one of his employees.</p> <p>That means that it's rare that a photo of a single protester or a handful of protesters is distributed without a name. The wire photo editor said photographers don't ask permission, because they don't need it and asking would imply they did. But the minute someone expresses reluctance, the photographer moves on. All professional photographers carry identification.</p> <p>If it's a really peaceful protest, usually visible press identification is hanging on a lanyard. But if there is violence, the photographers take the lanyard off their necks for safety and keep their IDs in an exterior pocket, for quick access.</p> <p>A quick perusal of NPR's website suggests that photographers are asking protesters for their names. In most photos where a protester can be identified, he or she is named in the caption. Asking for the name gives a protester the opportunity to ask the photographer to not use an image. And while there is no legal obligation to grant the request, in most cases, photographers will do so.</p> <p>Of course, there are plenty of photos where protesters are not identifiable.</p> <p>However, some images buck this trend. But they appear to be in the minority.</p> <p>The best recommendation I can offer to NPR is to eliminate photos in this last category. If the name of an easily identified individual is available, use it in the caption. If the name is not available, consider whether it's the best and only image that conveys an important story that can't be told any other way — and if possible find another image. When you have a satisfactory alternative, why not use it? Otherwise, the audience will wonder about your judgment — rather than focus on the story you want them to know.</p> <p>Research by Meredith Roaten</p> <p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

The Intercept reported that the merger allowed Chinese clients to access Dean and other politically connected Americans that are on Dentons's payroll.</p> <p>Dean is the latest Democrat to introduce domestic partisan squabbles to debates over America's foreign relations with China. During the height of the coronavirus pandemic in March, Democrats led by Rep.

It would be good to have a woman,” Lewis said. “It would be good to have a woman look like the rest of America—smart, gifted, a fighter, a warrior. And we have plenty of able women, some of black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I think the time has long past of making the White House look like the whole of America.”</p> <p>Biden’s endorsement by Lewis came a good month before the Democratic primary is set to be held in Georgia on May 19, Lewis’ home state. The primary was initially planned on March 24, but postponed due to the outbreak of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, commonly known as the novel coronavirus. Currently, the state Democrats are considering organizing an all-mail election.</p> <p>Lewis, who is 80 years of age, was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreas cancer last year but is nonetheless determined to go on the campaign trail to endorse his friend.</p> <p>Lewis was a leading civil rights activist in the 1960s.</p> <p>“I saw people that were beaten, arrested and jailed. On March 2, 1965, more than 600 of us were beaten, left bloody, some of us left unconscious.” Lewis said, according to The Hill.</p> <p>Lewis was referring to “Bloody Sunday,” March 3, 1965, when he and some 600 other black voting-rights activists upon trying to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama were bashed by Georgia police officers. Lewis, then 25, fractured his skull as a result.</p>",2
901521797,Jammu and Kashmir police find China link in grenade attacks on forces,2020-01-25 23:03:00+05:30,"<p>Investigations by the Jammu & Kashmir Police (JKP) into seven grenade attacks on Indian security forces since the nullification of Article 370 last August have revealed a link between the terror strikes -- they were all Chinese-made grenades, and four of their levers had the same serial numbers -- according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>This has led the investigators to conclude that a consignment of Chinese ordnance used by the Pakistan Army was smuggled into the Valley across the Line of Control (LoC), the people added.</p> <p>Officials from JKP and North Block, who asked not to be named, said that grenades with the same series of Chinese levers (86P/01-03/632) were used in four attacks in Srinagar district. The lever (or safety handle) falls off when the pin is pulled before hurling a grenade.</p> <p>The officials cited above said that use of Chinese-made grenades in Pakistan-backed terror ops was evident from the fact that 23 grenades and 17 AK-series rifles seized by Punjab Police since August 2019 were dropped using Chinese-made drones across the international border. Punjab Police has busted eight modules and arrested 41 alleged terrorists post August 2019.</p> <p>Over the past five months, Punjab Police has also seized 221kg of pure Afghan heroin smuggled across the border from Pakistan. The officials added that the drugs were being used to fund terror strikes against India.</p> <p>The use of Chinese grenades is a change from the past, when the Arges grendade, manufactured by an Austrian firm, was used in major attacks in India – including the 2008 Mumbai strike, the 1993 Mumbai blasts and the 2001 Parliament attack. The Wah Cantonment Ordnance factory in Rawalpindi held had a franchise to manufacture the high-explosive Arges hand grenades. The officials said with the collaboration now discontinued, the Pakistan Army was relying on Chinese weapons and ordnance.</p> <p>A retired Indian Army general told HT that same series of Chinese grenade levers shows that Pakistan was trying to “orchestrate violence in Kashmir post the August 5 reorganisation of J&K and that consignments of rifles and ordnances have been smuggled to put the plan into action”.</p> <p>On Saturday, four overground workers of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) were apprehended by security forces in Bandipora. The recoveries, according to the forces, included two under-barrel grenade launchers, four UBL grenades, two pistols, 10 AK-47 magazines, and 312 AK rounds.</p> <p>SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON</p>",2

REUTERS/Brenda Goh</p> <p>Zhang Zhan, 37, the first such person known to have been tried, was among a handful of people whose firsthand accounts from crowded hospitals and empty streets painted a more dire picture of the pandemic epicentre than the official narrative.</p> <p>“I don’t understand. All she did was say a few true words, and for that she got four years,” said Shao Wenxia, Zhang’s mother, who attended the trial with her husband.</p> <p>Zhang’s lawyer Ren Quanniu told Reuters: “We will probably appeal.”</p> <p>The trial was held at a court in Pudong, a district of the business hub of Shanghai.</p> <p>“Ms Zhang believes she is being persecuted for exercising her freedom of speech,” Ren had said before the trial.</p> <p>Critics say that China deliberately arranged for Zhang’s trial to take place during the Western holiday season to minimize Western attention and scrutiny. U.S. President Donald Trump has regularly criticised Beijing for covering up the emergence of what he calls the “China virus”.</p> <p>The United Nations human rights office called in a tweet for Zhang’s release.</p> <p>“We raised her case with the authorities throughout 2020 as an example of the excessive clampdown on freedom of expression linked to #COVID19 & continue to call for her release,” it said.</p> <p>Criticism of China’s early handling of the crisis has been censored, and whistle-blowers such as doctors warned.

Her lawyers told the court that police strapped her hands and force-fed her with a tube. By December, she was suffering headaches, giddiness, stomach ache, low blood pressure and a throat infection.</p> <p>Requests to the court to release Zhang on bail before the trial and livestream the trial were ignored, her lawyer said.</p> <p>Other citizen-journalists who have disappeared in China without explanation include Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.</p> <p>While there has been no news of Fang, Li re-emerged in a YouTube video in April to say he was forcibly quarantined, while Chen, although released, is under surveillance and has not spoken publicly, a friend has said.</p> <p>(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: here) (This story corrects ""last year's"" to ""this year's"" in first paragraph)</p>",2

I am therefore once again asking you all to work with government in this fight.</p> <p>“This is not a joke. It is a matter of life and death. Mosques in Makkah and Madina have been closed. The Pope celebrated Mass on an empty St. Peter’s Square. The famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris held Easter Mass with less than 10 people. India, Italy and France are in complete lockdown. Other countries are in the process of following suit. We cannot be lax.</p> <p>“The previously issued guidelines on exempted services shall remain.</p> <p>“This is a difficult decision to take, but I am convinced that this is the right decision. The evidence is clear.</p> <p>“The repercussions of any premature end to the lockdown action are unimaginable”.</p> <p>Also, President Muhammadu Buhari has issued a new directive to ministers as he extended the Coronavirus lockdown order for another 14 days.</p> <p>Buhari, while addressing the nation in a nationwide broadcast, yesterday, directed the ministers to develop a comprehensive policy for a ‘Nigerian Economy functioning with COVID-19’.</p> <p>He said: “To ensure our economy adapts to this new reality, I am directing the Ministers of Industry, Trade and Investment, Communication and Digital Economy, Science and Technology, Transportation, Aviation, Interior, Health, Works and Housing, Labour and Employment and Education to jointly develop a comprehensive policy for a ‘Nigerian economy functioning with COVID-19’.</p> <p>“The ministers will be supported by the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and Economic Sustainability Committee in executing this mandate.</p> <p>“I am also directing the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, the National Security Adviser, the Vice Chairman, National Food Security Council and the Chairman, Presidential Fertiliser Initiative to work with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to ensure the impact of this pandemic on our 2020 farming season is minimized.”</p> <p>The President further thanked the health workers at the frontline fighting COVID-19 as he commended the achievement so far during these days of lockdown.</p> <p>It would be recalled that Buhari had on March 29 ordered a total movement restriction in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun states.</p> <p>According to the president, the order was based on the advice of the Federal Ministry of Health and the NCDC.</p> <p>Similarly, the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on the COVID-19 pandemic, yesterday, said the spread of the virus in the country has slowed down.</p> <p>The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, disclosed this during the daily media briefing by the task force in Abuja.</p> <p>He further stated that based on the evaluation of experts, assessment of available data and experiences of other nations currently in the same situation, the PTF has submitted its recommendations to President Muhammadu Buhari, and urged Nigerians to please await further pronouncements in this regard.</p> <p>Mustapha, who is also the chairman of the PTF, said 92 per cent of contacts tracing has been achieved.</p> <p>He assured Nigerians that the task force was already making headway on the fight against the pandemic, urging the public to continue to maintain calm, observing all the advisories and to continue showing understanding by respecting the measures instructed in containing the spread of the virus.</p> <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, since the broadcast of the President on Sunday, 29th March, 2020, the Presidential Task Force has, with your support accomplished the following objectives that underpinned the measure: ‘Slow down the spread in order so as not to overwhelm our fragile health system; intensified case identification, testing and isolation. Intensified contact listing and isolation-(92 per cent of all contacts have been identified).</p> <p>“Increased laboratories by 100 per cent – (Lagos -3; Abuja-2; Irua-1; Ibadan UCH-1; Iree-1; Jos-1; Kano-1; Abakaliki-1), there are now 11 laboratories in the network.</p> <p>“Increased testing by 50 per cent, to the current capacity of 1,500 tests per day, with over 6,000 tests done. Procurement concluded for new high throughput testing by end of the month.</p> <p>“Distributed Personal Protective Equipment to over 40,000 healthcare workers – there have been no stock outs. Trained over 7,000 Healthcare workers on infection prevention and control. Deployed NCDC teams to 19 states. Visited Lagos to evaluate the readiness.</p> <p>“Despite all of these, the PTF is convinced that we must deliver more. We have also been assessing the impact of the lockdown and the level of compliance by Nigerians.</p> <p>“While we recognize the difficulties associated with such unprecedented action, we remain certain, however, that it is a step in the right direction for us to secure a healthier tomorrow.</p> <p>“Based on the evaluation of experts, assessment of available data and experiences of other nations currently in the same situation, the PTF has submitted its recommendations to Mr. President and I urge Nigerians to please await further pronouncements in this regard.</p> <p>“The PTF continues to appeal to all Nigerians to remain calm, maintain personal hygiene, observe physical distancing and stay at home”, he said.</p> <p>The Federal Government also recommended the use of face masks by Nigerians in order to reduce their susceptibility to infection by the novel Coronavirus.</p> <p>According to the government, Nigerians do not have to resort to using ‘medical-grade’ or surgical masks which are normally discarded after four hours of usage, advising that homemade masks which are cheap and reusable would serve the same purpose.</p> <p>The Health Minister, Dr Osagie Ehanire, said the usage of mask was not compulsory, but only a recommendation by the task force.</p> <p>“We said we are recommending. We are not saying it is compulsory, we are recommending. Secondly, we also said that, it does not have to be hospital-grade mask. It does not have to be medical or surgical-grade. You can make your own and preferably, your mask can be washable. You can wash it and iron it and reuse.</p> <p>“The ones many of us are using here now are single-use which you have to throw away but you do not need that for day to day activities and the purpose of that mask is to shield you and shield your opposite because if anyone is emitting any kind of droplet or particles by way of coughing or sneezing or when people are shouting, laughing or exclaiming, you can capture them through the barrier.</p> <p>“It can even be a scarf you tie across your mouth so that you do not run the risk of transmitting it to someone else. That is why we said it must be washed every evening, preferably in warm water and then dried and ironed. If you do that, you are safe to reuse it the next day. We are making that recommendation and also particularly stretching it to food vendors in the interest of their customers”, he said.</p> <p>The National Coordinator of the Task Force, Dr Sani Aliyu, on his part, said newly-opened laboratories in the country are currently underutilized.</p> <p>According to him; “On the issue of testing, I know there has been a lot in the Press recently. Part of the reason why we have not proceeded as fast as we can is because of the demand as well. We are not having as much demand for testing in those laboratories that we have activated and I am asking those laboratories particularly the ones that were activated in the last few days to please put forward processes that will allow them to key in, particularly in areas where there are suspicions of people having COVID-19.</p> <p>“This does not only include people who have had contact or those who have travelled abroad. It also includes persons with unusual respiratory tract infections, particularly severe respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization and I will ask that those laboratories that we have activated in the last one week should widen their scope when it comes to selection of testing based on our protocols so that we can have more positives identified and isolated.</p> <p>“There is no room for massive community testing for Coronavirus. I would rather do a hundred tests and get 10 positives rather than do 1, 000 tests and get 10 positives. It is all a out improving the efficiency of the tests. It is better to test persons that have symptoms because what we call the pre-test probability is higher.</p> <p>“When we talk about incubation period, this is the period between when you get an infection and the time the symptoms happen. And the incubation period is when the virus multiplies in the body and it is not excreted. If you are in the incubation period, you will not be excreting the virus and the test is looking for the presence of the virus.</p> <p>“Therefore, if you do the test during the incubation period which may range from between two, three days to 14 days, the test will be negative. In other words, you could still be in an incubation period and it will give you a false assurance that everything is alright. That is why we do not recommend doing the tests in the absence of symptoms.</p> <p>“The reason why in some cases some people might be asymptomatic and still have a positive result, which is extremely rare, is because a lot of people might have mild symptoms that you will not even notice. This is why we need to do the test at the right time in order to pick up the virus.</p> <p>“So, we are not going to start doing massive testing in the communities. It will be inefficient, it will be expensive and it is not going to help us increase the number of positives”, he explained.</p> <p>In his remarks, the Aviation Minister, Senator Hadi Sirika, who spoke on the face-off between the ministry and the Rivers State Government, said the Federal Government was currently dialoguing with the state government to effect the release of two pilots of Caverton Helicopters who were last week arrested and remanded at a state facility in Port Harcourt for breaching an Executive Order made by the state Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike.</p>",2

907542249,"Grief, anger and calls for action after shooting in Germany",2020-02-21 00:00:00,"<p>By DAVID McHUGH and FRANK JORDANS</p> <p>Associated Press</p> <p>HANAU, Germany (AP) — Hundreds of grieving people are flocked to Friday prayers in the mosques of the German town of Hanau, two days after a racially motivated shooting shook the country and prompted fresh calls for a crackdown on far-right extremism.</p> <p>Germany’s top security official said authorities would step up the police presence throughout the country and keep a closer watch on mosques and other sites, in a first reaction to the rampage. In Hanau, German and Turkish flags flew at half-staff outside a mosque where worshipers were gathering Friday.</p> <p>A 43-year-old German man fatally shot nine people with immigrant backgrounds in the Frankfurt suburb late Wednesday before apparently killing his 72-year-old mother and himself. Half of the victims were reported to be Turkish.</p> <p>The man, identified as Tobias Rathjen, left a number of rambling texts and videos espousing racist views and claiming to have been under surveillance since birth.</p> <p>More than 300 people attended prayers at the Turkish-speaking DITIB mosque attended by at least one of the victims. “The mood is subdued,” said Adam Arslan, who was friends with Gokhan Gultekin, who died in the attack. “I cannot accept this crime.”</p> <p>“May our almighty God rest the souls of our brethren who lost their lives in Wednesday’s heinous racist attack,” Fevzi Hoguk, the imam, or prayer leader, told the congregation.</p> <p>Mosques opened their doors to journalists who have swarmed into Hanau after the attack — not the usual practice in privacy-obsessed Germany. A half-dozen TV cameras plus photographers and journalists mingled freely with the congregation before and after Friday prayers.</p> <p>The chairman of the mosque board, Memduh Onder, said the community was not afraid, “because we are together,” citing the memorial gathering in front of city hall Thursday evening where German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke. “The thousands of people on the square, most of them were German,” he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, officials confirmed they had received a letter from the suspect last November in which he sought help from authorities in stopping the surveillance he believed he was under. The letter didn’t ring any alarm bells with prosecutors, officials said.</p> <p>Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said state-level security officials and security agencies he consulted Thursday agreed to increase the law enforcement presence around the country. Seehofer said there would be more surveillance at “sensitive sites,” including mosques, and a high police presence at railway stations, airports and borders.</p> <p>“The threat posed by far-right extremism, anti-Semitism and racism is very high in Germany,” Seehofer told reporters in Berlin.</p> <p>Thousands of people gathered in cities across Germany on Thursday evening to hold vigils for the shooting victims but also to express anger that authorities haven’t done enough to prevent attacks despite a string of incidents in recent years. Last week, authorities arrested 12 men — including a police employee — on suspicion of planning attacks on Muslims and politicians.</p> <p>Some have also called for a crackdown on the extremist and anti-migrant ideology that has crept into mainstream political debate with the rise of the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD.</p> <p>A top official in the center-left Social Democratic Party, a junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, accused AfD of providing ideological fodder to people like the Hanau shooter.</p> <p>“One person carried out the shooting in Hanau, that’s what it looks like, but there were many that supplied him with ammunition, and AfD definitely belongs to them,” Lars Klingbeil told German public broadcaster ARD on Friday.</p> <p>Parts of Alternative for Germany already were under close scrutiny from Germany’s domestic intelligence agency. The party has rejected all responsibility for far-right attacks, including an anti-Semitic attack on a synagogue and the killing of a regional politician last year.</p> <p>One key question in the investigation is whether authorities or others were aware the suspect posed a threat.</p> <p>“That’s one of the points that’s particularly interesting to me in this investigation,” said Seehofer. “Who knew what.”</p> <p>Peter Frank, Germany’s chief federal prosecutor, said the investigation would concentrate on the suspect’s movements prior to the attack, and whether he had had contact with other people. The suspect’s father was being questioned as a witness, he said.</p> <p>Frank acknowledged that his office had received a letter from the suspect three months ago. The letter didn’t contain many of the more explicit racist and genocidal comments later found in the document posted on Rathjen’s website and didn’t prompt any action from prosecutors, Frank said.</p> <p>Seehofer noted that rules intended to ensure stricter background checks on gun owners came into force Thursday — a day after the attack — but that he was open to the idea of tightening the rules further.</p> <p>One hurdle to effective communication between different branches of government in Germany is the country’s treasured notion of privacy — which grew out of the experiences with the Nazi police state and communist East Germany — along with the complex web of local, regional, state and federal authorities that might be involved in checking a person’s suitability for gun ownership.</p> <p>“We will always respect data protection,” said Seehofer. “But the discussion about data protection mustn’t push aside the discussion about security in this country.”</p> <p>___</p> <p>Jordans reported from Berlin.</p> <p>Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

915483885,A former aide for students with disabilities was charged with battery. He’s the second worker at Gages Lake to be arrested this school year.,2020-03-31 00:00:00,"<p>Gages Lake School is one of several school programs operated by the Special Education District of Lake County. It serves young students with behavioral disabilities. (John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune)</p> <p>This story is a collaboration between the Tribune and ProPublica Illinois.</p> <p>A Gages Lake School worker has been arrested and charged with battering a 7-year-old student in the school’s seclusion-room space, the Lake County sheriff’s office said Monday.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The aide was assigned to work in an area called “office intervention” where workers take students who have been removed from class for disruptive behavior. Records show that Justin Cole, 35, of Kenosha, Wisconsin, had been working as a paraprofessional for about three weeks when, on Feb. 27, school administrators notified police about an incident earlier in the day.</p> <p>A Chicago Tribune and ProPublica Illinois investigation in December revealed numerous child welfare, police and other investigations at the school, which regularly put children in a seclusion area and physically restrained them. The news organizations’ “The Quiet Rooms” investigation found that schools throughout the state misused and overused the practices, which were only to be used if there was a physical safety concern.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>It’s the second time in the last year that an employee at Gages Lake, which serves about 115 students with behavioral disabilities, has been charged with a crime related to mistreatment of a child inside the school’s seclusion rooms. The school is part of the Special Education District of Lake County.</p> <p>Another former aide who worked in the Gages Lake behavior management office was arrested and charged in October with six counts of reckless conduct for using “excessive force” on children. He pleaded not guilty and the case is pending.</p> <p>In the most recent case, sheriff’s deputies allege Cole used “excessive force” in responding to a child who pushed him. Cole picked up a pillow “and struck the 7-year-old in the head” with his hand, using the pillow as a barrier between his hand and the boy’s head, according to the sheriff’s investigation.</p> <p>“This caused the boy to fall to the ground and begin crying,” the sheriff’s office said.</p> <p>Cole was put on unpaid leave and then fired earlier this month, records show.</p> <p>“Essentially, he lost his temper while assisting a highly dysregulated student and did not exercise our protocols for de-escalation or calling in other staff for help,” Meagan Dwyer, who oversees behavior supports for the school, wrote in a letter to parents in late February. She told parents that another staff member had notified administrators of the incident.</p> <p>In a note to parents on March 27, after the Lake County state’s attorney issued a warrant for Cole’s arrest, SEDOL Superintendent Valerie Donnan wrote that Cole had received “extensive” training in how to work with students who have behavioral challenges. Attempts to reach Cole’s attorney for comment were unsuccessful Monday. He was charged with one count of misdemeanor battery.</p> <p>From May until December 2019, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services opened more than 20 child-welfare investigations into mistreatment of children at Gages Lake.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Surveillance video from the school gathered by DCFS and referenced in the agency’s reports describe workers grabbing children by the wrists, shoving them into walls and throwing them to the ground in “the office,” which was a cluster of four seclusion spaces — some with lockable doors, others open. All of the doors were removed by late November as the school dealt with scrutiny from investigators and from the Illinois State Board of Education.</p> <p>Jennifer Smith Richards is a reporter for the Chicago Tribune.

During a meeting last week between Lavrov and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the two parties laid out the various areas of dispute, but they also agreed there exist potential topics of cooperation, such as on how to stop climate change.</p> <p>New tensions over Belarus also are expected to be discussed at the summit. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is a Putin ally facing increasing resistance to his rule. Over the weekend, Lukashenko’s government was accused of forcing down a civilian airliner traveling over his country’s airspace to arrest a dissident journalist who was on board. The act drew condemnation from the United States and many European leaders.</p> <p>Geneva is a favorite location for international conferences, summits and other major gatherings. That’s in part due to Switzerland’s historic decision to be neutral in various conflicts. The country also is not a member of NATO, the military alliance that Putin has long seen as a potential threat, making it more palatable to Russia as a meeting place.</p> <p>In 1985, Geneva was the site of the first meeting between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The gathering — at which arms control was focus — helped the leaders develop a personal rapport with one another.</p> <p>In 2015, Geneva was one of the cities that hosted international talks that led to the Iran nuclear deal. U.S. and Iranian officials, whose governments officially do not have diplomatic relations, hashed out the details together in the Swiss city as well as in Vienna and other places, along with representatives of several other countries.</p> <p>The Biden administration had consideredseveral potential locations for the summit. Other contending cities included, but were not limited to, Vienna and Helsinki, also favored locations for international meetings.</p> <p>One of the cities under serious consideration to serve as host was Bratislava, Slovakia, where President George W. Bush and Putin met in 2005.</p> <p>Helsinki was less likely to be chosen than some of the other possibilities because former President Donald Trump met with Putin there in 2018. Trump at the time appeared to accept Putin’s assurances that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, despite the American intelligence community’s assessments that it did.</p> <p>Trump’s deference to the Russian leader during the Helsinki summit infuriated both Democrats and Republicans.</p> <p>Anita Kumar contributed to this report.</p>",2

We demand that UNRWA address the core problem, and demonstrate its genuine commitment to basic norms of education in its schools, by publicly condemning UNWRA employees who incite terrorism and anti-Semitism, removing them from their positions, and creating an independent and impartial investigation of all of its staff,” he stated.</p> <p>Similar reports by other organizations have been published in the past, and almost without exception, the UNRWA has failed to take action.</p>",2

Every Nigerian should be of concern to Nigerians. Now if you say 100, 000, where did you even get the data?</p> <p>“In any case, are you saying 100, 000 people are not people. Are they not Nigerians?

933966283,Why Putin should fear presidential election in Belarus,2020-07-09 00:00:00,"<p>Why Putin should fear presidential election in Belarus</p> <p>By Vladislav Inozemtsev</p> <p>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been ruling Belarus with an iron fist since 1994.</p> <p>However, his grip on the country has weakened significantly in the past few months, and he might well be out after the presidential election scheduled for Aug. 9. Such an outcome would not only shake up Belarus, it would also give Russian President Vladimir Putin serious cause for concern.</p> <p>At the beginning of this year, Lukashenko seemed unchallengeable. Most Belarusians believed that their strongman leader would win a sixth term in office in the same corrupt way that he had secured his previous victories. Even Lukashenko’s opponents suddenly went silent as he defended Belarusian sovereignty in the face of Putin’s plans to “integrate” the two post-Soviet states.</p> <p>However, COVID-19 has changed everything. As Lukashenko proclaimed the pandemic “nonsense,” and lied regularly about its scope and casualties, ordinary people affected by the crisis started to turn on him.</p> <p>They particularly resented pressure by the authorities to attend May 9 commemorations of the end of World War II without masks or protective gloves, and to sign a petition in favor of Lukashenko’s re-election.</p> <p>In early May, the authorities arrested the popular blogger Sergey Tikhanovsky, who had announced his intention to run for president.</p> <p>However, his wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, is now bidding to stand in his place and has received enthusiastic support.</p> <p>Last month, lines to sign her ballot petition in Minsk, Brest and Gomel stretched for nearly a kilometer, despite police urging people to disperse.</p> <p>Opinion polls conducted between May 20 and May 22 — before the authorities banned them — indicate that only 3 to 6.24 percent of voters support Lukashenko, with Tikhanovskaya at 12.7 to 18 percent and the former Belgazprombank chief executive officer Victor Babariko — now jailed by the Belarusian KGB — the clear front-runner, backed by 50 to 54.9 percent of respondents.</p> <p>On Tuesday last week, the Belarusian Central Election Commission formally allowed Babariko and Tikhanovskaya to run after it reviewed their supporters’ signatures. A Lukashenko “victory” over them on Aug. 9 would almost certainly trigger another Eastern European “color revolution.”</p> <p>However, Lukashenko’s possible demise after a quarter-century of wielding near-dictatorial power is not the only reason why the presidential election matters. The other is the long-standing tendency for political developments in Belarus to foreshadow events in its giant neighbor.</p> <p>Russian leaders have been following in Lukashenko’s footsteps since the mid-1990s. Then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin’s 1996 re-election campaign, including its appeal to Russians to “vote with your heart,” was copied straight from Lukashenko’s 1994 campaign. When Putin succeeded Yeltsin in 1999, he — like Lukashenko three years earlier — proclaimed the return of “stability.”</p> <p>Just as Lukashenko revived the Soviet-era Belarusian flag and seal, Putin restored the Soviet national anthem in Russia. Putin also followed Lukashenko’s lead in eradicating independent political parties and forcing opponents into exile or killing them (and sometimes both).</p> <p>In both countries, parliament and the courts were transformed into departments of the presidential administration, while Russian laws concerning “foreign agents” and “unwelcome foreign organizations” emulated Belarusian legislation.</p> <p>Finally, Putin’s national referendum on Wednesday last week, which formally allowed him to remain president beyond 2024 — by resetting the clock on the constitutional limit of two consecutive terms — mirrored Lukashenko’s in 2004.</p> <p>Allowing Russians to vote online or outside of polling stations resembles the week-long “early voting” period in Belarus, which has secured Lukashenko one victory after another.</p> <p>Lukashenko’s defeat next month would thus represent a huge symbolic blow to the Russian version of his political model and could shape Russia’s future much more than Ukraine’s efforts to throw off dictatorship have done. Whereas Russian leaders have long regarded Ukraine as a country that looks to the West rather than following Russia’s path, they view Belarus as Russia’s most trusted friend and ally.</p> <p>Russians deeply respect Belarusians for the suffering they endured during World War II, and the two countries’ citizens have enjoyed equal economic status since the establishment of the Union State of Russia and Belarus in 1999. So, while most Russians expected that Ukraine would eventually opt for liberal democracy and reject Soviet-style autocracy, a similar shift in Belarus could shatter the foundations of Putin’s regime.</p> <p>Nowadays, Lukashenko seems to be equated with Belarus in the same way that Putin is with Russia. Or, as the current chairman of the Russian Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, put it in 2014: “There is no Russia today if there is no Putin.”</p> <p>Like Lukashenko, Putin is now trying to perpetuate himself in power, deprive voters of any say in decisionmaking, and capitalize on Soviet heritage rather than modernizing the country. Lukashenko’s failure to secure re-election would thus make a deep impression on Russian voters.</p> <p>Rising tensions between Putin and Lukashenko make the situation even more intriguing.</p> <p>Since 2000, Russia has subsidized Belarus to the tune of more than US$100 billion, receiving nothing but supportive political statements in return. Lukashenko frequently criticizes Putin and leads the Russia-skeptic forces within the Eurasian Union, Putin’s aspirational geopolitical construct.</p> <p>Moreover, the Kremlin might no longer have either the ability or the will to intervene in Lukashenko’s favor. The fact that Belarus lacks ethnic divides of the sort that facilitated Russian incursions into Ukraine also weakens Putin’s position.</p> <p>The big question now is whether Belarus will follow the same democratic path that Ukraine chose in 2014 — one hopes without the violence. If Lukashenko falls, then Putin’s regime might also start to appear far less incontestable.</p> <p>Vladislav Inozemtsev is the founder and director of the Center for Post-Industrial Studies in Moscow.</p> <p>Copyright: Project Syndicate</p>",2
1010676876,Fate of Anti-War Journalism Lies in Upcoming Assange Hearings,2021-10-22 00:00:00,"<p>Within just a few days, the United States will once again make its case in a UK court that it has a right to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be tried under the Espionage Act, in what remains this century’s most dangerous attack on global press freedom.</p> <p>These hearings, taking place on October 27 and 28, are an attempt to appeal the decision that Judge Vanessa Baraitser made earlier this year to not extradite Assange to the United States because it is likely he will commit suicide if subjected to the inhumane conditions of the U.S. prison system. However, while this decision was focused on his health, these hearings are really about what the Assange case has always been about: the United States’ determination to silence anyone who exposes the crimes of the US empire.</p> <p>Leading press freedom and human rights organizations have been clear about the implications of a potential Assange extradition and have called on President Biden to drop the case. If there were still any doubts that the Department of Justice’s focus on Assange was corrupt and politically motivated, those who remain skeptical should consider two major revelations about the US campaign against Assange since the last hearing.</p> <p>Earlier this year the Icelandic news outlet Stundin reported that a key witness in the prosecution against Assange admitted to lying in his indictment. This witness was Sigurdur Ingi Thordarson, a convicted pedophile and fraudster. The FBI promised Thordarson immunity from prosecution under the condition that he lie about his relationship with WikiLeaks in an indictment which would strengthen the DOJ’s conspiracy charge against Assange. Along with the debunked claim that Assange pressured whistleblower Chelsea Manning into hacking a US government computer, Thordarson’s indictment was supposed to paint Assange as having a pattern of pressuring sources to commit cyber crimes. The Stundin article should put to rest any belief that the United States is being honest about its stated reasons for going after Assange.</p> <p>But the Stundin article is not even the most concerning glimpse into the prosecution’s true character. Just this month, Yahoo News reported that Mike Pompeo, the main force behind Trump’s decision to pursue extradition, was obsessed with punishing Assange for publishing the Vault 7 documents which revealed the CIA’s activities of electronic surveillance and cyber-warfare. Though The Grayzone initially broke this news in May 2020, the recent Yahoo News report includes additional details of Pompeo’s obsession. Most shockingly, Pompeo held such a vendetta against Assange that he considered arranging a shoot-out in the streets of London with the British government to assassinate Assange.</p> <p>It is still unclear if either of these facts will be considered in the UK court’s upcoming hearings. There remains a dangerous lack of solidarity with Assange from the press, which is exactly why it is so important that this extradition not happen. As mainstream news outlets become increasingly complacent, and even supportive of pro-war policies, it becomes more essential that anti-war voices, and anti-war journalists in particular, resist the attempt by the United States to set the precedent that the act of publishing war crimes is a punishable offense.</p> <p>After 20 years of the United States military destroying entire countries under the guise of fighting terrorism, there is finally a partial reckoning with US warmongering around the world. It cannot be said that Americans are particularly anti-war now, but at the very least, Biden’s decision to pull US troops from Afghanistan was widely popular across the political spectrum. Yet, many news outlets instead chose to emphasize the minority position on Afghanistan by prioritizing commentary from interventionists and weapons lobbyists over anti-war scholars and activists, and by falsely representing the US occupation of Afghanistan as a positive. This sudden emphasis on the supposedly positive role of US occupation in Afghanistan is a particularly dangerous line for journalists to push considering how little effort the US media placed on covering the conflict prior to withdrawal. One study found that in 2020, three major news outlets gave the conflict a combined coverage of less than five minutes.</p> <p>In contrast to publications that take such a careless or outright supportive stance on the irreparable harm of US foreign policy are WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. Following his view that ""if wars can be started with lies, they can be stopped by truth,"" Assange has published some of the most vital information on US foreign policy of the 21st century with perfect accuracy. Some of the information provided to the public (thanks to the anonymous online source submission system developed by Assange) includes the CIA rendition program, detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay, and US war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and more. It is this view on publishing which understands war as something to be exposed and resisted that has made Assange such a hated figure by warmongers in the United States.</p> <p>However, as every Assange supporter knows, a potential extradition of Assange will not just stop with Assange. The fear is that the torture he has endured and a possible extradition and even sentencing under the Espionage Act would enable the US government to do the same to anyone else who exposes the crimes of the US military. Even if the United States cannot successfully imprison every journalist who exposes its crimes, such a precedent would likely scare publications into even greater submission to the state. The desired outcome is the complete neutering of anti-war journalism.</p> <p>Despite the many problems with the mainstream press, journalism as an institution remains one of the most effective methods of resisting, and at times, ending wars. Even those distrustful of the press should be willing to oppose attacks on the right to a free press when such attacks occur. It is the guarantee of press freedom that enables anti-war reporting to make its way into the mainstream at times, shifting people’s understanding of what their government does.</p> <p>One recent example of the power of the press is the reporting that the New York Times and Washington Post did on the US military’s drone strike of an Afghan aid worker, Zemari Ahmadi, and his family. Though these two publications are often the principal cheerleaders of US foreign policy, their recent independent investigations into Biden’s drone strike brought the US drone program to the attention of the American public. As a result, the Pentagon had to admit it not only killed a civilian and his loved ones, but knowingly lied to the public by falsely claiming they had proof that this man was an ISIS-K operative. That admission of guilt and dishonesty may not have come if not for the power that the reporters at the Times and the Post chose to wield over the warmongers in the Pentagon.</p> <p>One has to wonder: if these publications chose to routinely use their immense resources and platforms to scrutinize the military, rather than provide PR for it, would the drone program even still be operating? Would the war in Afghanistan have ended much sooner? Could the invasion have been avoided entirely?</p> <p>These are questions that cannot be answered, but they should be asked of journalists as the US continues to prioritize military spending and beat the drum for a new war with China. The press still has the power to challenge and prevent US wars. However, this power hangs in the balance in the form of Julian Assange’s fate. Recent coverage of the Afghanistan withdrawal shows the potential for two types of press. One which sees its role as the mouthpiece for the most war-hungry members of a global empire or one that shows the true nature of war to the public, enabling them to oppose it and giving its victims some justice. For anti-war advocates who would rather see the latter option covering foreign policy, it is essential to show strong support for Julian Assange and demand the charges against him be dropped immediately.</p> <p>Sam Carliner is a journalist based in New Jersey.

948713078,California man found guilty of putting semen in co-worker's water bottle,2020-09-25 16:30:31+01:00,"<p>A man in Orange County, California was convicted on Monday for assault and battery charges after he was found guilty of putting his semen in his co-worker's water bottle and work space. Stevens Millancastro, 30 is set to be sentenced Oct. 6, and could face up to two years and six months in prison all because his advances towards a female colleague were rejected.</p> <p>Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Roberts found Millancastro guilty of multiple counts of misdemeanour assault and battery and determined that he committed the crimes for sexual purposes. He was also ordered to register as a sex offender, The Orange Country Register reports.</p> <p>Millancastro's attempts to retaliate against his female co-worker took place between November 2016 and January 2017, as prosecutors accused him of being obsessed with the woman. He had asked her out on a date but then he began to behave oddly when she turned him down. He started to ceaselessly stare at her enough to make the woman ask her boss to tell him to stop. She was then forced to file a complaint with the HR department.</p> <p>From that time, the woman would come to work on several occasions and find a murky substance in her half-filled water bottle. Upon her insistence, her boss agreed to set up a surveillance camera to keep an eye on her desk. The woman came to work another morning and discovered a ""milky white substance"" on her keyboard.</p> <p>Upon reviewing the footage, detectives were able to determine how Millancastro waited for the woman to leave and then smeared something on her keyboard and mouse using tissues. Police also said Millancastro had also put his semen in her water bottle as well as a bottle of honey she uses in her tea.</p> <p>The woman testified against Millancastro saying that he made her feel extremely uncomfortable and that his conduct towards her was just disgusting.</p> <p>Michael Morrison, the attorney representing Millancastro, acknowledged his client's ""highly inappropriate"" behaviour. However, he strongly denied that the man was acting out of sexual gratification. His reasons for this were based on the man's desire to retaliate against the woman after she lodged a complaint with the HR. Morrison claims his client's actions were brought on by his fear of losing his job.</p>",2
988755443,"In Belarus, yellow tags single out political prisoners",2021-06-04 00:00:00,"<p>KYIV, Ukraine — While visiting her son in a Belarusian prison, Natallia Makavetskaya saw deep scars on his wrists left by tight handcuffs. She also noticed the yellow tag sewn onto his clothes.</p> <p>The tags mark those jailed for joining demonstrations against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and single them out for “particularly harsh prison conditions,” Makavetskaya told The Associated Press.</p> <p>“They have decided that my son is prone to extremism and treated him accordingly,” she said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>Her son, Uladzislau Makavetsky, was convicted in December of threatening a police officer with a truncheon during a clash between protesters and police in his hometown of Vitebsk, and was sentenced to two years in prison. He denied the charges, saying he was only trying to protect an elderly man who had been beaten by police, and he just tossed away a truncheon dropped by one of the officers.</p> <p>Makavetsky told his mother that authorities at prison colony No. 22, located near Brest on the border with Poland, denied him any personal items or visitors for a time. During daily lineups, he was ordered to stand apart from other prisoners and say: “I’m prone to extremism.” Prisoners with yellow tags also get extensive regular searches.</p> <p>The 28-year-old woodcarver was one of more than 35,000 people arrested in Belarus in a harsh crackdown on protests that followed Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that was widely seen as rigged. Thousands were severely beaten by police.</p> <p>The wide-ranging repression was spotlighted again on May 23, when a Ryanair flight traveling from Greece to Lithuania was diverted to Minsk where authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was aboard. Outraged European Union authorities denounced the action as air piracy and imposed more sanctions on the country.</p> <p>Belarus human rights activists say authorities have toughened prison conditions in recent months for those who took part in protests. Many of them have been marked with the yellow tags, a practice denounced by human rights activists.</p> <p>“The tags’ yellow color draws direct associations with yellow Stars of David for Jews in Nazi Germany, and it’s hard to understand why the Belarusian authorities did it,” said Valiantsin Stefanovich of the Viasna human rights center. “In any case, these dangerous experiments lead to stigmatization of political prisoners by prison authorities and other inmates.”</p> <p>Viasna says that at least 460 political prisoners are being held in Belarusian penitentiaries on criminal charges related to protests that carry terms from six months to several years.</p> <p>The Belarusian authorities have ignored criticism of harsh conditions for jailed protesters. Lukashenko has repeatedly cast protesters as pawns in what he described as efforts by Western spy agencies to destabilize Belarus and forcefully change the government.</p> <p>Besides Makavetskaya, three other women told the AP that their sons had yellow tags sewn on their clothes when they visited them in April and May.</p> <p>One of them, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Valiantsina, fearing reprisals from authorities, said her son told her he is kept in handcuffs around the clock. The IT specialist from Minsk is serving his four-year sentence in prison colony No. 1 in the city of Novopolotsk.</p> <p>“My son whispered to me that he was being held for days in a stretched position in a punishment cell, his legs stretched far apart to cause intense pain without any trace left,” she told AP.</p> <p>Another prisoner who was given a yellow tag was Katsiaryna Barysevich, a journalist of the Tut.by independent news portal who was released last month after serving six months on charges of revealing personal data in her report about a protester’s death.</p> <p>“I wouldn’t say that I have been broken,” Barysevich told reporters after her release. “I have learned to look calmly at mad things.”</p> <p>Liubou Kaspiarovich, another Tut.by journalist who spent 15 days in jail last month for covering a trial related to protests, said she and 14 others in her two-bed cell had to sleep on the concrete floor that was still wet with chlorine bleach.</p> <p>“They were waking us up several times during the night, ordering us to report the criminal law articles we were charged with, and each morning they poured a bucketful of chlorine on the floor,” Kaspiarovich told the AP. “And they put a homeless woman who had lice in our cell.”</p> <p>Vitold Ashurok, who was among the first to draw attention to harsh conditions and yellow tags for political prisoners, died inside a prison in Shklov, where he was serving a five-year sentence for participating in protests. The authorities said Ashurok, 50, died of a heart attack May 21, although his death certificate didn’t list a cause of death.</p> <p>When relatives were given his body, which bore bruises and a bandage on his head, authorities also released a video in which a man purported to be Ashurok was seen grasping his head and collapsing before officers enter. The opposition said the video was doctored.</p> <p>Viasna’s Stefanovich questioned the official version of Ashurok’s death.</p> <p>“An absolutely healthy person suddenly dies in custody … and they don’t name the cause of death, and (then) hand over his body with bandages,” he said. “What are people supposed to think?”</p> <p>His death brought an outpouring of anger.</p> <p>“He died in the struggle for freedom and a brighter future for Belarus,” U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher said on Twitter, adding that Ashurok’s “wrongful imprisonment and senseless death demand accountability.”</p> <p>Another prisoner tried to slit his throat with a pen in court Tuesday after authorities threatened his family with criminal charges. Stsiapan Latypau, 41, was hospitalized and put in a medically induced coma afterward.</p> <p>German Foreign Ministry expressed shock and anger over the incident. Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said it “symbolizes the hopelessness that Lukashenko brings upon his citizens with his repression and also the brutal violence that is obviously being used there.”</p> <p>Human rights activists and relatives of those being held have urged the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Belarusian prisons to inspect conditions for political prisoners.</p> <p>“They are cranking up repressions and there is no way to find out the truth about what’s going on behind the walls of the Belarusian prisons that have inherited the worst Soviet traditions,” said Viasna’s Stefanovich.</p> <p>Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed.</p> <p>—-</p> <p>Follow all AP stories about developments in Belarus at https://apnews.com/hub/belarus</p>",2
987025197,Shane Bazzi: Supporters raise $100k to help gay Australian refugee,2021-05-26 00:00:00,"<p>Peter Dutton has issued defamation proceedings against Shane Bazzi. (Cameron Spencer/Getty/Twitter)</p> <p>A gay refugee activist who is being sued for defamation by Australia’s defence minister has received more than $100,000 in donations to fight his case.</p> <p>Defence minister Peter Dutton issued defamation proceedings against Shane Bazzi in April after the latter referred to him as a “rape apologist” on social media.</p> <p>The defence minister is seeking aggravated damages and costs from Bazzi, who is currently unemployed and recently had his benefits cut off due to a change in government policy.</p> <p>Because of the high cost of launching a legal defence, Green Party candidate David Shoebridge set up a crowdfunding campaign aiming to raise $150,000. On Wednesday (26 May), the crowdfunder had raised more than $119,000.</p> <p>“One of the most powerful men in the country, Peter Dutton, is suing me for defamation,” Bazzi tweeted in April.</p> <p>“I need your support. If you have the means, please donate to my legal fund and share this far and wide. Any support is greatly appreciated.”</p> <p>Shoebridge’s crowdfunder said Bazzi was being sued “for expressing an opinion, by way of critique and commentary, that the politician does not like.”</p> <p>The Green Party politician characterised Dutton’s legal action as “an attempt to silence Shane and others like him from expressing a particular view”.</p> <p>He wrote: “Historically, defamation laws have too often been used by the powerful (including politicians) as a tool to stop free speech and silence critics.</p> <p>“Defending defamation threats is very expensive, meaning many people are often forced to retract their statements even if they are true or an expression of an honest opinion.”</p> <p>Shoebridge said freedom of speech should protect a member of the public’s right to express an opinion about a political figure, and said politicians should “expect robust critique and commentary as part of the job.”</p> <p>If the crowdfunder exceeds its goal, additional funds will be donated to the Refugee Advice and Casework Service and to the Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia, Shoebridge said.</p> <p>Peter Dutton’s legal action ‘raises concerns about freedom of speech’</p> <p>Bazzi’s solicitors said they plan to “vigorously defend” the activist against Dutton’s defamation lawsuit in a press release.</p> <p>“Mr Bazzi expressed an honest opinion on Twitter that Peter Dutton was a ‘rape apologist’. This opinion was based on a number of publicly reported statements that had been attributed to Mr Dutton. Statements that were about matters in the public interest and that would undoubtedly provoke a number of different opinions, including that expressed by Mr Bazzi,” O’Brien Criminal & Civil Solicitors said in a statement.</p> <p>“A robust and vibrant democracy like ours should cultivate and encourage a diverse array of expressions of opinion on matters of public interest.”</p> <p>The solicitors said Dutton’s legal action “raises genuine concerns about freedom of speech in Australia”, adding: “While there must be some limits to that freedom, we will always defend the right of people to hold opinions, especially against politicians.”</p> <p>The defamation proceedings come after Brittany Higgins, a former staffer in Scott Morrison’s government, claimed she was raped by a male colleague in Parliament House in 2019.</p> <p>In February, Dutton faced fierce backlash when he said he hadn’t been provided with the “she said, he said details” of Higgins’ allegations.</p> <p>On 25 February, Bazzi shared an article on Twitter from 2019 in which Dutton was quoted as saying that women were falsely claiming they had been raped and needed an abortion in order to qualify for refugee status in Australia.</p> <p>Bazzi tweeted the article and characterised Dutton as a “rape apologist”. Dutton later said he would take legal action against a number of people for “defamatory” statements on social media.</p> <p>“I’m going to start to pick out some of them to sue, because we need to have… a respectful public debate,” Dutton said in March.</p> <p>“A lot of lazy journalists pick up these tweets and believe that they’re representative of the larger community view, when they’re not.”</p> <p>Larissa Waters, leader of the Green Party in the Senate, had also described Dutton as a “rape apologist” on social media following his “she said, he said” comment.</p> <p>On 24 March, she issued an apology on Twitter, saying she had made “false and defamatory statements” about the defence minister.</p> <p>PinkNews has contacted Peter Dutton for comment.</p>",2

The organization has not yet taken a stance on the proposal.</p> <p>The ACLU's concerns about deadly interactions with police come amid widespread protests over recent incidents where Black individuals were killed by white officers.</p> <p>A prosecutor on Wednesday announced that Kim Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who on Sunday fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, would be charged with second-degree manslaughter, The Associated Press reported. Authorities said the shooting was accidental and that Potter had intended to draw and fire a Taser.</p> <p>Wright's death coincided with the ongoing murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. George Floyd died in May after Chauvin kneeled on the handcuffed man's neck for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>In response to Floyd's death, Helfrich last year suggested the public should record any interactions with police.</p> <p>Ryan Supler, a York City Council candidate, said concerns about racial profiling could be assuaged by evenly distributing cameras throughout the city.</p> <p>That could, however, prove problematic, said Montez Parker, who was contracted by the nonprofit organization Better York to lead a feasibility study of the proposed surveillance system.</p> <p>“In certain areas, there might not be the infrastructure to place a camera,” he said.</p> <p>Better York, the city and the York County District Attorney's Office raised more than $30,000 to fund the study, which is expected to be completed by mid-June, Parker said.</p> <p>If a program were implemented in York, officials say it would be operated by a nonprofit organization with a community board.</p> <p>— Logan Hullinger can be reached at lhullinger@yorkdispatch.com or via Twitter at @LoganHullYD.</p>",2

888198354,"Netanyahu Calls Indictment a ‘Coup,’ Says ‘Investigators Should Be Investigated’",2019-11-21 20:10:28,"<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit’s decision to indict him on Nov. 21 “an attempted coup,” urging the investigators to be investigated.</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference, Netanyahu criticized Mandelblit for making his decision during the “most sensitive time politically since the establishment of the state.”</p> <p>Currently, Israel is on the brink of its third round of elections if the Knesset doesn’t form a coalition in 21 days.</p> <p>“This is an attempted overthrow of a prime minister [with a] biased investigation,” Netanyahu said. “Indictment publicized faster than ever at the most sensitive timing. The recommendation was also published a few weeks before the last election.”</p> <p>He accused the investigators of “inventing new crimes” and “selective enforcement on steroids. It’s enforcement just for me.” He advocated for an independent commission to investigate the investigators.</p> <p>“I cannot believe that the country I fought for and was wounded for, that I’ve brought to such achievements, that in this country, in its democracy, there will be this kind of tainted justice, of selective enforcement,” Netanyahu said. “I won’t let the lie win. I will continue to lead this country with devotion. For this country, for the rule of law, for justice, we have to do one thing: to finally investigate the investigators.”</p> <p>Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three cases.

Cases 2000 and 4000 involve Netanyahu allegedly using regulations to empower specific news outlets in exchange for more favorable coverage.</p> <p>Mandelblit said in his announcement of the indictment that his decision wasn’t political. “We’re not infallible or above criticism,” he said. “But we acted without fear or prejudice, for the rule of law.”</p> <p>Daily Wire Editor-In-Chief and Journal columnist Ben Shapiro explained in a Twitter thread that Netanyahu’s indictment opens up a whole new set of possibilities for Israel’s political future.</p> <p>(1) Netanyahu applies to the Supreme Court to have his trial take place while he is PM, which means it takes place in Jerusalem and he is likely fined but not jailed.

991558844,"AP Interview: Belarus regime 'frightened,' says opponent",2021-06-23 00:00:00,"<p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya talks during an interview with The Associated Press in Brussels, Tuesday, June 22, 2021. Tsikhanouskaya says President Alexander Lukashenko may have miscalculated last month by diverting a Ryanair passenger jet to Minsk, where a dissident journalist aboard was arrested. The exiled novice politician says the incident has galvanized the West against Lukashenko, who had never crossed this red line before. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)</p> <p>BRUSSELS – When authorities in Belarus diverted a Ryanair passenger jet to Minsk last month to arrest a dissident journalist who was aboard, their goal may have been to silence a troublesome government critic and send a message to others like him.</p> <p>Instead, believes opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, it was a panicked miscalculation by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko that has galvanized the West against him.</p> <p>“It was really a mistake,” Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with The Associated Press. “The regime never crossed this red line before, of interfering in a European area. This hijacking touched all the European leaders because their citizens were on this flight.”</p> <p>The European Union, the United States, Britain and Canada joined together Monday to impose sanctions on several Belarus officials and organizations in response to the May 23 diversion of Ryanair flight, which was traveling from Greece to Lithuania but was forced to land in Minsk. European officials, who likened the diversion to air piracy, also banned Belarus airlines from EU skies and airports.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>Lukashenko won a sixth term as president in an Aug. 9, 2020, election that the EU refuses to recognize as legitimate. The disputed election touched off months of mass demonstrations in Belarus, including some that drew as many as 200,000 people. Authorities there also began a harsh crackdown on protesters, and human rights officials say tens of thousands have been detained, with many brutally beaten by security forces.</p> <p>Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said EU countries thought for months that it still might be possible to reason with Lukashenko — until the flight diversion.</p> <p>“The mood is different now,” Landsbergis said.</p> <p>Tsikhanouskaya was a candidate in the election, running in place of her husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a popular opposition figure who had hoped to stand against Lukashenko but was arrested in May 2020.</p> <p>A day after the vote, Tsikhanouskaya was forced to flee the country to neighboring Lithuania, where the 38-year-old political novice lives in exile with her children and has worked to rally European countries against Lukashenko.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>“The regime is so frightened by the unity of Belarusians, by the unity of the European Union, the U.S.A., about this situation in Belarus that they stopped to think strategically. They started to think emotionally,” Tsikhanouskaya told AP.</p> <p>On Thursday, her husband's trial is scheduled to begin in the city of Homel on charges of violating public order, inciting hatred and plotting mass disturbances — accusations he rejects. He faces up to 15 years in prison.</p> <p>“The trial will be closed. The trial will be not in the court, it will be right in the prison. Lawyers will not have an opportunity to tell us what is going on,” Tsikhanouskaya said.</p> <p>She expects it to last a month or two, and is not optimistic about the outcome.</p> <p>“We understand that the trial will not be lawful, will not be honest, will not be fair. In reality, judges can write any number of years in prison,” she said.</p> <p>For Tsikhanouskaya, it’s yet another test of her ability as an accidental politician to avoid putting her own feelings for her husband above those of the many Belarusians who have been jailed for opposing the government.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>“He’s my beloved. I’m thinking about him most of all, because I’m talking about him with my children. I have every day to explain to them where their Daddy is, how he is feeling,” she said. “I assure them that he will come back soon.”</p> <p>She must “separate all those feelings from political duties, because your political duty is to release all of them,” Tsikhanouskaya said.</p> <p>“This is your personal pain. You can cry into your pillow in the evening. But just imagine in what conditions those people are in, what conditions my husband is (in) — without light, without information, without the normal conditions of life. Of course, it’s awful,"" she said. ""But again, it gives me strength not to stop, not to think about myself.”</p> <p>Since he was pulled off the Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich has been paraded on state TV, tearfully apologizing for his actions and praising Lukashenko.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>His parents, members of the opposition and others in the West believe he spoke under duress, with some saying there were signs he was beaten — a warning that no regime opponent can ignore.</p> <p>Pratasevich’s friends say the 26-year-old journalist, who left his homeland in 2019, believed he was being spied upon by Belarusian authorities before his May 23 arrest. This probably is true for many other political activists from Belarus, said Tsikhanouskaya, who a week earlier had flown Ryanair from Greece to Lithuania, just like Pratasevich.</p> <p>As she travels Europe to raise awareness about Belarus, she feels “more or less in safeness.”</p> <p>“People on the ground (in Belarus), they don’t have this protection of laws that the European Union has,” she said.</p> <p>Beyond the immediate fate of Pratasevich, her husband Siarhei and others like them, difficult times lie ahead for her country, Tsikhanouskaya said.</p> <p>“This crisis is deepening,” she said.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>If the authorities in Minsk really cared about people “they would start dialogue with Belarusians, they would release political prisoners, and solve this crisis in a civilized way,"" she added.

In the meantime, books in the September promotional box “will be screened and flagged by a team of staff members who are charged with bringing titles to senior staff’s attention that meet the United Nations’ criteria for hate speech”.</p> <p>This is defined as “any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are”.</p> <p>Other planned changes include an audit of all internal ABA policies and process “through a diversity, equality and inclusion lens”, a new copyeditor role responsible for “reviewing for conscious language and an awareness of equity and inclusion issues” in ABA communications with members, and the creation of a beta advance access programme for marginalised voices that will attempt to get more proofs by writers from marginalised communities into the hands of booksellers.</p> <p>American Booksellers Association apologised for sending anti-trans book ‘within hours’</p> <p>The American Booksellers Association apologised hours after members opened their July promotional box to find a copy of Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters by anti-trans journalist Abigail Shrier.</p> <p>The book describes trans identity as “a peer contagion among teen girls”, perpetuating the idea that being trans is inherently harmful to youth and something to be “cured”.</p> <p>“A generation of girls is at risk,” the description reads. “Abigail Shrier’s essential book will help you understand what the trans craze is and how you can inoculate your child against it – or how to retrieve her from this dangerous path.”</p> <p>Amazon previously acknowledged the book’s “offensive content” when it suspended a paid-for advertising campaign last year (though it continues to sell the title), Target also pulled the book from shelves in February.</p> <p>Despite this, the ABA sent the book to 750 independent bookstores as part of its monthly “white box” mailing, which includes a range of promotional and marketing materials and recommended titles that “publishers wish for booksellers to read and consider stocking”.</p> <p>Within hours, as trans booksellers flagged the incident on Twitter, the American Booksellers Association had issued a grovelling apology.</p> <p>“An anti-trans book was included in our July mailing to members,” they said in a statement. “This is a serious, violent incident that goes against ABA’s ends policies, values, and everything we believe and support.

963075462,"Housing prices: No dips in sight as demand, lumber, labor costs push prices higher",2021-01-06 21:37:30-05:00,"<p>By David Pendered</p> <p>The prospect of falling home prices – affordable units or market-based – shows no signs of appearing at the start of 2021. Demand for dwellings exceeds supply, and prices for lumber and labor remain above expectations.</p> <p>This is how the Atlanta Fed put it in its Dec. 2, 2020 Beige Book report:</p> <p>“Construction costs, especially lumber and labor, remained elevated. Consequently, home prices continued to rise, putting pressure on affordability.”</p> <p>Another recent federal report, issued Dec. 23, 2020 shows that home sales in the South led the other regions of the nation through 2020. This demand is evident in the time an abode is on the market. The national average is 4.1 months, according to the federal report; the Atlanta average is 61 days, according to a report by Norada Real Estate Investments, which observed:</p> <p>“Experts consider the market balanced when the number of listings is equal to about six months of sales.”</p> <p>Headlines may go to hot housing markets in other regions, but this pace of sales in the South can’t be overlooked. The South reported the lowest rate of seasonal slowdown in sales in November, compared to October, as compared to the rest of the country. The South reported the highest increase of sales based on a comparison of sales in November 2019 and November 2020, according to the Census/HUD report – up 30.5% in the South; up 20.8 for the nation; and up 19.8% in the historically effervescent West.</p> <p>Bruce Gunter, a longtime provider of affordable homes in Atlanta and now president of Civitas Group, said Wednesday the home prices reflect two components of housing development – supply and demand, and cost of labor and materials.</p> <p>“Supply hasn’t kept up with demand, and the costs of construction have to be a reason for the impeded supply,” Gunter said. “Maybe not the biggest reason, but a reason.”</p> <p>Lumber prices are just one example of material costs that skyrocketed in 2020 and have not fallen as expected.</p> <p>By last autumn, rising lumber prices had added more than $16,000 to the price of an average house, during a run-up on lumber prices that exceeded 170 percent from April to mid-September, according to a report by the National Association of Home Builders.</p> <p>Forecasters expected prices would recede for reasons including a decline in tariffs on Canadian imports that took effect in November, from 20% to 9%, and a seasonal slowdown in construction as winter curbed construction in colder climates.</p> <p>The expected priced dip came – and quickly left.</p> <p>The price of random lengths of lumber did drop, from around $950 per thousand board feet in late September to around $560 in mid November. Prices immediately climbed and were around $880 on Jan. 1, according to an NAHB report.</p> <p>Gunter said labor shortages are a significant concern on the supply side of the equation. He said the issue of immigrant workers is well known, and worth keeping in mind in discussions over the cost of new-build dwellings.</p> <p>“This is now an old story – the clamping down on immigration has hurt a lot of homebuilders,” Gunter said. “A lot of the workers were Hispanic and clamping down on them constrained a source of labor. Replacements, when they were available, came at a higher cost.</p> <p>“These are pretty good jobs, construction jobs, and they are skilled jobs,” Gunter said. “Skilled labor goes fast.”</p>",2
973192385,REPORT: 100K Migrants Apprehended at U.S.-Mexico Border in February,2021-03-06 00:00:00,"<p>Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 100,000 migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border in February, according to information leaked to Reuters by federal officials. This represents the largest number of migrant apprehensions in February since 2006.</p> <p>Reuters published previously unreported numbers showing that Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 100,000 migrants in February. If the numbers are accurate, they represent an increase of nearly 33 percent from January. Officials expect the official numbers to be released next week.</p> <p>The rapidly increasing number of apprehensions follows the abandonment of Trump-era border security and immigration control policies by President Joe Biden during his first days in office.</p> <p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sent a letter to President Biden on Friday requesting a meeting to discuss “great concerns” with the administration’s approach to the border, Reuters reported.</p> <p>“We must acknowledge the border crisis, develop a plan, and, in no uncertain terms, strongly discourage individuals from Mexico and Central America from ever making the dangerous journey to our southern border,” McCarthy wrote.</p> <p>The number of apprehensions of migrants continues to increase in March with officials acknowledging the arrest of more than 4,500 migrants on Wednesday, the article continues.</p> <p>On Thursday, U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar (D-TX) reported the apprehension of approximately 10,000 migrants in the Rio Grande Valley Sector during a seven-day period — 2,500 in the previous two days.</p> <p>“We are weeks, maybe even days, away from a crisis on the southern border. Inaction is simply not an option,” Congressman Cuellar said in a written statement. “Our country is currently unprepared to handle a surge in migrants in the middle of the pandemic.”</p> <p>Of particular concern is the growing number of unaccompanied minors being apprehended at the border. The massively increasing number led to the Biden administration holding minors in Border Patrol facilities beyond the 72-hour legal limit.</p> <p>Democrat leaders in South Texas are also critical of the president’s policies that are forcing the release of migrants infected with COVID-19. Officials in Brownsville, Texas, report more than six percent of migrants being released at a local bus station are testing positive for COVID-19.</p> <p>Texas State Senator Jose “Chuy” Hinojosa (D-McAllen) also complained about the migrants being released without being tested, Breitbart Texas reported in February. “[Border Patrol agents] were just dropping them off at the bus station without testing them. Obviously, that’s very alarming to all of us in that they’re coming from Central America and through Mexico and to be released into the United States without being tested for COVID is really unconscionable,” the Democrat state senator said.</p> <p>Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior news contributor for the Breitbart Texas-Border team.

Michel Euler</p> <p>A demonstrator takes a picture of policemen during a protest against a bill on police images, in Paris, earlier this month. AP — Christophe Ena</p> <p>PARIS — French activists fear that a proposed new security law will deprive them of a potent weapon against abuse — cellphone videos of police activity — threatening their efforts to document possible cases of police brutality, especially in impoverished immigrant neighborhoods.</p> <p>French President Emmanuel Macron’s government is pushing a new security bill that makes it illegal to publish images of police officers with intent to cause them harm, amid other measures. Critics fear the new law could hurt press freedoms and make it more difficult for all citizens to report on police brutality.</p> <p>“I was lucky enough to have videos that protect me,” said Michel Zecler, a Black music producer who was beaten up recently by several French police officers. Videos first published Thursday by French website Loopsider have been seen by over 14 million viewers, resulting in widespread outrage over police actions.</p> <p>Two of the officers are in jail while they are investigated while two others, also under investigation, are out on bail.</p> <p>The draft bill, still being debated in parliament, has prompted protests across the country called by press freedom advocates and civil rights campaigners. Tens of thousands of people marched Saturday in Paris to reject the measure, including families and friends of people killed by police.</p> <p>“For decades, descendants of post-colonial immigration and residents in populous neighborhoods have denounced police brutality,” Sihame Assbague, an anti-racism activist, told The Associated Press.</p> <p>Videos by the public have helped to show a wider audience that there is a “systemic problem with French police forces, who are abusing, punching, beating, mutilating, killing,” she said.</p> <p>Activists say the bill may have an even greater impact on people other than journalists, especially those of immigrant origin living in neighborhoods where relationships with the police have long been tense. Images posted online have been key to denouncing cases of officers’ misconduct and racism in recent years, they argue.</p> <p>Assbague expressed fears that, under the proposed law, those who post videos of police abuses online may be put on trial, where they would face up to a year in jail and a $53,000 fine.</p> <p>“I tend to believe that a young Arab man from a poor suburb who posts a video of police brutality in his neighborhood will be more at risk of being found guilty than a journalist who did a video during a protest,” she said.</p> <p>Amal Bentounsi’s brother, Amine, was shot in the back and killed by a police officer in 2012. The officer was sentenced to a five-year suspended prison sentence. Along with other families of victims, in March she launched a mobile phone app called Emergency-Police Violence to record abuses and bring cases to court.</p> <p>“Some police officers already have a sense of impunity. … The only solution now is to make videos,” she told the AP. The app has been downloaded more than 50,000 times.</p> <p>“If we want to improve public confidence in the police, it does not go through hiding the truth,” she added.</p> <p>The proposed law is partly a response to demands from police unions, who say it will provide greater protection for officers.</p> <p>Abdoulaye Kante, a Black police officer with 20 years of experience in Paris and its suburbs, is both a supporter of the proposed law and strongly condemns police brutality and violence against officers.</p> <p>“What people don’t understand is that some individuals are using videos to put the faces of our (police) colleagues on social media so that they are identified, so that they are threatened or to incite hatred,” he said.</p> <p>“The law doesn’t ban journalists or citizens from filming police in action ... It bans these images from being used to harm, physically or psychologically,” he argued. “The lives of officers are important.”</p> <p>A “tiny fraction of the population feeds rage and hatred” against police, Jean-Michel Fauvergue, a former head of elite police forces and a lawmaker in Macron’s party who co-authored the bill, said in the National Assembly. “We need to find a solution.”</p> <p>Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti has acknowledged that “the intent (to harm) is something that is difficult to define.”</p> <p>In an effort to quell criticism, lawmakers from Macron’s party announced Monday they would rewrite the criticized article of the bill, which will be debated by the Senate early next year.</p> <p>Activists consider the draft law just the latest of several security measures to extend police powers at the expense of civil liberties. A statement signed by over 30 groups of families and friends of victims of police abuses said since 2005, “all security laws adopted have constantly expanded the legal field allowing police impunity.”</p> <p>Riots in 2005 exposed France’s long-running problems between police and youths in public housing projects with large immigrant populations.</p> <p>In recent years, numerous security laws have been passed following attacks by extremists.</p> <p>Critics noted a hardening of police tactics during protests or while arresting individuals. Hundreds of complaints have been filed against officers during the yellow vest movement against economic injustice, which erupted in 2018 and saw weekends of violent clashes.</p> <p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said out of 3 million police operations per year in France, some 9,500 end up on a government website that denounces abuses, which represents 0.3%.</p> <p>France’s human rights ombudsman, Claire Hedon, is among the most prominent critics of the proposed law, which she said involves “significant risks of undermining fundamental rights.”</p> <p>“Our democracy is hit when the population does not trust its police anymore,” she told the National Assembly.</p>",2
969216403,"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wins privacy case against British tabloid",2021-02-11 20:31:19,"<p>LONDON - Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, won her High Court privacy case against the Mail on Sunday after a judge ruled that the tabloid had invaded her privacy by publishing a letter the former American actress wrote to her estranged father.</p> <p>It's a major legal victory for the duchess, the wife of Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. She sued the Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Mail on Sunday and the MailOnline, for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement following articles published in 2019 that featured segments of a five-page letter she had written to her father, Thomas Markle.</p> <p>The duchess said that she was ""grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers and The Mail on Sunday to account for their illegal and dehumanizing practices.""</p> <p>In an emailed statement, she added: ""For these outlets, it's a game. For me and so many others, it's real life, real relationships, and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.""</p> <p>Mark Warby, the High Court judge, said that the duchess ""had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The Mail articles interfered with that reasonable expectation.""</p> <p>In his judgment, Warby also wrote: ""It was a communication between family members with a single addressee. Precautions were taken to ensure that it was delivered only to him. It was, in short, a personal and private letter.

992259891,Interstate prison transfers as weapons of political repression: My nine years in domestic exile,2021-06-27 07:08:44,"<p>Transferring prisoners between states is human trafficking, a legacy of slavery and a form of “enforced disappearance” – a crime under international law since the 1946 judgment of the Nuremberg Tribunal against Nazi war criminals. Rashid, along with thousands of other prisoners, has been bounced back and forth between supermax prisons, death rows and work camps in Virginia, Indiana, Texas and Florida with the intention of alienating him from friendships and pitting people against him. Nothing deters Rashid from making art or speaking out against these oppressors and his efforts to enlighten minds softened by the prison system. – Art: Kevin “Rashid” Johnson, 264847, Wabash Valley Correctional Facility, P.O. Box 500, Carlisle IN 47838</p> <p>by Kevin ‘Rashid’ Johnson</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>In December 1990, a Special International Tribunal was held on the existence and abuse of political prisoners and prisoners of war (PPs and POWs) in the United States. The tribunal was conducted both to politically educate the public and as a semi-judicial event to put the Amerikan government on public trial, in light of its persistent denial of the existence of PPs in the U.S. and its use of extreme methods of repression to suppress political activism and expression of the poor, workers, oppressed nationality people of color and their anti-imperialist allies.</p> <p>A formal indictment was drawn up against the U.S. government by longtime movement attorneys Jan Susler and Lennox S. Hinds on behalf of nearly 100 PPs and POWs held in the U.S. That indictment enumerated several categories of political imprisonment practiced by the U.S. government. Under “Count III: Cruel, Inhumane and Degrading Treatment,” it identified Amerika’s use of interstate prison transfers as a form of political repression against political prisoners. It stated:</p> <p>“Retaliatory Transfers: Political prisoners, including those who have become politicized since their incarceration, are transferred from one prison to another in retaliation for the exercise of their right to free speech and/or association in the prisons, and/or to isolate them from outside friends and supporters. Most states and the federal government are now parties to an interstate compact permitting a prisoner in one state to serve his/her sentence thousands of miles away from home and family.”</p> <p>Politicized in captivity</p> <p>Since 2012, I have been transferred between states under interstate compacts five times because of my political activities: from my home state of Virginia to Oregon, Texas, Florida, then back to Virginia and now to Indiana. In my transfer to Indiana, I was traded with Shaka Shakur, another prisoner who has been politically active for a number of years and a thorn in the side of Indiana prison officials. He wrote about our swap in a 2019 article.[1]</p> <p>I’d spent the first decade of my imprisonment physically warring against abuses of myself and other prisoners in the Virginia prison system. I was first exposed to revolutionary ideas and history and began my political journey in 2001, and from there began writing and working with outside activists.</p> <p>In addition to writing political articles, I wrote about the abuses I and others suffered and witnessed, contributed to developing several prisoner support organizations, national and state-based protest actions, cofounded the New Afrikan Black Panther Party – NABPP, now the Revolutionary Intercommunal Black Panther Party, or RIBPP – and other efforts.</p> <p>I was repeatedly targeted with trumped up criminal indictments for physical resistance, all of which were thrown out in turn with me representing myself.</p> <p>In 2009 I was labeled a “domestic terrorist threat” in the 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment Report written by the Virginia State Police’s fusion center in collaboration with the feds. According to the report, the reason for this slanderous classification and blatant political targeting was the proven “influence” of my writings in rallying “prisoners and their associates on the outside to unite against law enforcement and the correctional system,” and my cofounding an organization – the NABPP – that sought “to continue the mission of the original Black Panthers.”</p> <p>With my work and publicizing prison abuses to the public, the repression I faced changed qualitatively and intensified in comparison to the repression I experienced when I’d responded with isolated physical resistance. I continued writing and organizing and was able to counter a lot of this repression by mobilizing outside supporters and through legal efforts.</p> <p>I was also repeatedly targeted with trumped up criminal indictments for physical resistance to guard abuses, including multiple counts of attempted capital murder against guards and felonious assaults, all of which were thrown out in turn with me representing myself.</p> <p>Retaliatory transfers</p> <p>It was then, in early 2012, that Virginia officials first transferred me without prior notice or hearing to another state, Oregon, where officials attempted to incite racial violence against and between me and various white supremacist prison groups, many of whom I ended up politicizing. I wrote about my Oregon experiences in a 2013 article, “Political Struggle in the Teeth of Prison Reaction.”[2]</p> <p>My political work and writings about abusive conditions continued in Oregon. I was subjected to repression there through the mentioned attempts to incite violence, bogus disciplinary actions, being thrown in solitary confinement and so on, which did nothing to deter me. Consequently, Oregon officials demanded that Virginia move me elsewhere.</p> <p>I was then transferred in 2013 to the notoriously abusive Texas prison system, where as soon as I arrived and while still in chains and defenseless, I was assaulted by guards in riot gear, then by ranking officials – an assistant warden, major and prison guard captain – and had my dreadlocks forcibly cut off.</p> <p>As soon as the restraints were removed, several physical altercations followed with their riot teams, who retreated, and I was promptly transferred from their reception center to a maximum security prison and thrown into solitary. This all occurred on my first day in the Texas prison system.[3]</p> <p>As in Oregon, my political work and writing exposing inhumane prison conditions continued in Texas. Again, repression followed, which I resisted and which had no deterrent effect on me. Texas officials ordered Virginia to remove me.</p> <p>As Kimberly Daniels, a Black Florida congresswoman stated after touring one such prison and the terrifying treatment even she received from the staff in 2018: “I couldn’t sleep for two days after leaving that place. It’s a culture. That’s a city where the KKK lived. And they work in the prison.”</p> <p>This time, during 2017, I was sent to Florida, the country’s most violently and notoriously abusive prison system, and held in that state’s most notoriously abusive prisons – prisons acknowledged by Florida’s own congressional representatives to be run by the Klan.</p> <p>As Kimberly Daniels, a Black Florida congresswoman stated after touring one such prison and the terrifying treatment even she received from the staff in 2018: “I couldn’t sleep for two days after leaving that place. It’s a culture. That’s a city where the KKK lived. And they work in the prison.”[4]</p> <p>She was talking about the Reception and Medical Center in Lake Butler, Fla., the first prison I was held at when I was first sent to Florida in 2017.</p> <p>Compared to my prior interstate placements, repression against me and abuses I witnessed were greatly increased in the Florida prison system. My writing and political work also intensified – again, I was not curbed.</p> <p>In Florida, officials also tried to hide my location from the public and outside supporters and frustrate my ability to communicate with the outside. I was not listed in the state’s online prisoner locator system, and people who called the prisons about me, including attorneys, were told I was located elsewhere.</p> <p>The deliberate concealment of my location added a particularly sinister and illegal aspect to my domestic exile, applying a German Nazi tactic of wartime political repression – enforced disappearance.</p> <p>Secret detention is a form of enforced disappearance which has been a crime under international law since the 1946 judgment of the Nuremburg Tribunal against Nazi war criminals. In relevant part, that tribunal convicted Nazi Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel for his role in enforcing Adolf Hitler’s “Night and Fog” decree issued Dec. 7, 1941, that called for secretly detaining and disappearing people deemed a threat to German security but “who were not to be immediately executed.”[5]</p> <p>After a physical altercation between me and guards, which was prompted by my speaking out about their routinely refusing meals and assaulting a neighboring prisoner who suffered obvious mental illness, Florida officials demanded that Virginia remove me “within five days.”</p> <p>Because Virginia officials didn’t have any other state willing to accept me within that timeframe, they had to temporarily take me back in. Upon my return, I was housed so as to keep me isolated from other prisoners. They admittedly feared my influence on others and exposing their mistreatments to the public.</p> <p>Initially I was held alone in a completely empty cellblock in the state’s super-maximum security Red Onion State Prison. Then I was moved to the state’s death row at Sussex One State Prison, where only three death row prisoners remained. They were ordered by the warden not to communicate with me. When these prisoners openly defied the warden, I was then moved into another isolated cellblock and denied outside exercise and other basic entitlements.</p> <p>Snitch jacketing is a particularly sinister counterintelligence tactic commonly used by the pigs specifically to destroy independent activists and organizations modeled after the FBI’s counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) against the BPP and American Indian Movement.</p> <p>Efforts to isolate me continued until Virginia officials finally negotiated with Indiana to take me. Here in Indiana, where I remain, officials have again tried to hide my location by not listing me in the state’s online prisoner locator system.</p> <p>Upon our being traded, both Shaka Shakur and I have been targeted with various well-established “counterintelligence” tactics, calculated to discredit and isolate us and incite conflict with prisoners, including official efforts to falsely portray us as informants – putting “snitch jackets” on us – to other prisoners in these “alien” states where we are relatively unknown to other prisoners.</p> <p>Snitch jacketing is a particularly sinister counterintelligence tactic commonly used by the pigs specifically to destroy independent activists and organizations. Ward Churchill wrote about it in his book on the FBI’s counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) against the BPP and American Indian Movement, where he explained:</p> <p>“‘Snitch-jacketing’ or ‘bad-jacketing’ refers to the practice of creating suspicion – through the spread of rumors, manufacture of evidence etc. ­– that bona fide organizational members, usually in key positions, are FBI or police informers, guilty of such offenses as skimming organizational funds and the like. The purpose of this tactic was to ‘isolate and eliminate’ organizational leadership; such efforts were continued – and in some instances accelerated – when it became known that the likely outcome would be extreme violence visited upon the ‘jacketed’ individual(s). Bad-jacketing was a very commonly used technique.”[6]</p> <p>Churchill went on to explain that “jacketing” people is “well known in prisons where guards are adept” at playing prisoners against each other.</p> <p>Indiana’s prisons present a particularly fertile environment for officials to snitch jacket prisoners. This is because the prison culture here is one where officials have successfully molded prisoners to think like them and have cultivated a value system where prisoners inherently distrust and compete with each other, but trust and look to win acceptance, favors and approval from the pigs. The Willie Lynch mentality and peer suspicion is deeply rooted in the culture.</p> <p>The prisoners are mentally softened up to not think critically or seek unity among themselves, by the prevalence of officially facilitated addiction and petty materialism and the uncritical practice of prisoners habitually gossiping, rumormongering, prying into others’ personal affairs and readily discussing personal things and engaging in “friendly” banter with the pigs – a total reversal of the old prison and political culture of decades past.</p> <p>An informant culture prevails where the prisoners openly give information to officials and spread misinformation generated by them.</p> <p>In any case, in Indiana, my political work and writings have continued, alongside my having previously unavailable access to communicate with outside people using the phone via tablets we have use of inside our cells throughout the day. I have therefore been able to contribute more directly to the outside work of others and organizations I support and cofounded. I continue to experience the range of repressions and remain undeterred as ever.</p> <p>These have been the conditions I have experienced and contended with, and which prompted my ongoing domestic exile – being bounced from state to state – over the past nine years. Political oppression and COINTELPRO are alive and well in Amerika.</p> <p>Specific accounts of the conditions I experienced and witnessed over these years can be read in the many articles on my website, which are separated according to each state system I have been imprisoned in – see rashidmod.com.</p> <p>Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win!

981106979,This Is Why It's Important to Correct the Liberal Media On Officer Sicknick's Death. It's Not Hard.,2021-04-21 00:00:00,"<p>Why circle back to Officer Brian Sicknick? It’s because it’s important to correct the record here. Sicknick was the Capitol Police officer who died during the Capitol Hill riots on January 6. For weeks, we were told it was murder. For weeks, we were told domestic terrorists (aka Trump supporters) were responsible. Everyone who voted for Trump, all 74 million of us, were culpable in his death. And it was dead wrong. Katie wrote up the medical examiner’s cause of death. In the end, Officer Sicknick died of natural causes (via WaPo):</p> <p>In an interview with The Washington Post, Francisco J. Diaz, the medical examiner, said the autopsy found no evidence the 42-year-old officer suffered an allergic reaction to chemical irritants, which Diaz said would have caused Sicknick’s throat to quickly seize. Diaz also said there was no evidence of internal or external injuries. Sicknick collapsed after returning to his office during the riot and died about eight hours later, on Jan. 7. Diaz said Sicknick suffered two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by a clot in an artery that supplies blood to that area of the body. Diaz said he could not comment on whether Sicknick had a preexisting medical condition, citing privacy laws.</p> <p>Beaten to death with a fire extinguisher.</p> <p>Poisoned with bear spray.</p> <p>Now - natural causes and ""no evidence of internal or external injuries.”</p> <p>The Brian Sicknick story was spun by police sources. But it is a media mistake that will stick for a while. https://t.co/NPjxcMOcCn — Steve Krakauer (@SteveKrak) April 19, 2021</p> <p>This blog post and Twitter thread from more than two months ago… did not age well.</p> <p>And is a good reminder about always being skeptical of your news sources - from all sides. https://t.co/2SUibhqpWM — Steve Krakauer (@SteveKrak) April 19, 2021</p> <p>It’s tragic. Of course, the Left and their allies in the media will try and say we’re trying to score political points, but we didn’t get the story wrong. You people did. In your lust to smear those with whom you disagree, you cooked up this false narrative about Trump supporters murdering police on the Hill. It didn’t happen. There’s a lot of media folks who should eat pavement for this, but the Derek Chauvin verdict in which the former officer at the center of George Floyd’s death was found guilty on all counts. There’s the Adam Toledo shooting in Chicago by police. The Daunte Wright shooting in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, and now another officer-involved shooting in Ohio. This will be buried, and accountability won’t be meted out to those who couldn’t keep their mouths shut in order to satisfy their moral superiority complex.</p> <p>The liberal media narrative on Sicknick got blown up. It’s not a story that’s good by any stretch of the imagination. An officer is dead, his family shattered, but it was the liberal media who weaponized his death to attack conservatives. And they should dragged for it. We didn’t start this fight. Some liberal reporters have called their side out as well.</p> <p>This confirms that no one was killed in the ""insurrection,"" in the sense of being violently targeted / aggressed upon by the mob. Imagine if that had been the narrative from the outset. Oh well — Michael Tracey (@mtracey) April 19, 2021</p> <p>Upon news from the medical examiner, Michael Tracey, a liberal reporter who is despised by other liberals, wrote, “this confirms that no one was killed in the ‘insurrection,’ in the sense of being violently targeted/aggressed upon by the mob. Imagine if that had been the narrative from the outset. Oh well.”</p> <p>And people wonder why the media is so distrusted. We have reporters who willingly and knowingly peddle fake news that now rivals the material manufactured out of Pyongyang.</p>",2

Intemperate and polarised rhetoric on social media has real-life results.”</p> <p>Rebecca Vincent, UK bureau director of press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders, said: “This comes after weeks of senior officials telling the public not to believe the media, whipping up the online ‘scum media’ mob, and now manifesting in physical aggression and violence.</p> <p>“This government’s intentional fuelling of hostility towards media must stop now.”</p> <p>“Scum media” has recently been trending on social media, increasing in frequency after some defended Dominic Cummings against accusations that he breached lockdown rules to travel from London to Durham, as revealed by the Guardian and Mirror.</p> <p>The unrest at the London protest followed more than a week of daily protests in the US over the killing of black man George Floyd as he was being arrested.</p> <p>In the US, more than 100 journalists are believed to have been assaulted, arrested or had their equipment damaged between Friday and Sunday night, mostly by US police, including a British press photographer who was arrested and charged despite identifying himself as press.</p> <p>Picture: Nine News screenshot</p>",2
970994615,SJC: Man Convicted For First-Degree Murder Of Boston Youth Worker To Get New Trial,2021-02-22 00:00:00,"<p>The state's highest court ruled Monday that one of two men convicted of first-degree murder in the killing of an innocent bystander during a confrontation in Dorchester should get a new trial.</p> <p>Wesson Colas was convicted in the killing of 26-year-old youth worker Dawnn Jaffier, and the non-fatal shooting of another woman, near Dorchester's J'ouvert Parade, a Caribbean festival, in 2014.</p> <p>Though Colas didn't fire a shot, prosecutors said he was equally responsible as the gunman, Keith Williams, because Colas pointed a weapon at the rival with the intent to kill and therefore participated in the gun battle. Williams was also sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder.</p> <p>But the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that there is not enough evidence that Colas intended to kill Williams. There is no evidence that the gun Colas had was even loaded, Justice Frank Gaziano wrote, or that he took any steps to fire it beyond pointing it in Williams' direction.</p> <p>Gaziano called it a ""close call.""</p> <p>""The fact that, in the midst of an argument, the defendant pointed a firearm at an opponent is not enough to carry the Commonwealth's burden,"" he wrote.</p> <p>Colas' appellate attorney, Esther Horwich, said there wasn't enough evidence that Colas even had a gun that day. She said those who testified against Colas had conflicting descriptions of the purported gun. She said it was more likely witnesses saw Colas' black and silver cellphone in his hand.</p> <p>The SJC declined to weigh in on the evidence.</p> <p>""This was an absolutely tragic shooting of innocent bystanders, and it's heartbreaking, but convicting someone who is innocent of the charges doesn't make it any better,"" Horwich said. ""In fact, I think it makes it worse.""</p> <p>The court ruled that Colas could be tried on second-degree murder. The decision on what to do next falls to Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins.</p> <p>In a statement issued Tuesday, Rollins said she was ""considering the options available to us with regard to a retrial,"" and would be speaking with the Jaffier family and the second victim.</p> <p>""Dawnn Jaffier’s life was stolen as the result of a feud in which she took no part. Legal nuances and 'close calls' offer no solace nor fill the enormous void left after Dawnn’s murder and the life forever altered of the shooting victim who survived,"" Rollins said. ""Dawnn’s family, her loved ones, the communities she devoted her brief life to empowering — and the surviving victim of this act of gun violence — are all left with unanswered questions and reopened wounds as the case against Mr. Colas enters this new chapter.""</p> <p>The shooter, Williams, is also appealing his conviction.</p>",2

874451257,Bridgeport absentees case bares similarities to 1986 investigation,2019-09-22 10:00:00,"<p>This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate</p> <p>BRIDGEPORT — A contentious late-summer primary between two bitter Democratic rivals ending with irregularities and likely state law violations in absentee voting, including charges of the illegal handling of ballots.</p> <p>That’s part of the fallout in the state’s largest city after a Hearst Connecticut Media investigation into the recent primary election between Mayor Joe Ganim and state Sen. Marilyn Moore.</p> <p>It’s a story reminiscent of the aftermath of an election 33 years ago. On Sept. 24, 1986, five Democratic workers were arrested and charged with illegally collecting and possessing absentee ballots, including Daniel Roach, now a top adviser to Mayor Joe Ganim and a longtime member of the city’s Police Commission.</p> <p>Roach, then and now the Democratic leader for the city’s Black Rock district, was a member of the city council at the time and the only elected official arrested. He took his case to trial, successfully fighting single charges of collecting and possessing an absentee ballot. During the 1988 court case where he was found innocent, a young lawyer named Joseph P. Ganim occasionally attended the trial in his support.</p> <p>At the time of his arrest, Roach called the charges “ridiculous.” He was defended by Ganim’s uncle, Raymond Ganim, and when evidence was presented, the chief witness against Roach couldn’t tell the difference between an absentee ballot application and the actual ballot, which is illegal to handle.</p> <p>Roach on Saturday recalled that the trial witness testified it was someone else, not Roach, who handled the absentee ballot.</p> <p>The case underscored a bizarre chapter in the city’s political history, in which a political pathfinder, state Sen. Margaret E. Morton, happened to see the campaign manager of her opponent stuff 45 absentee ballots into a mailbox on the sidewalk in front of the Middle Street post office on the morning of the Sept. 9 primary. Morton immediately called police, who seized the ballots and investigated.</p> <p>A subsequent probe by reporters on the two Bridgeport newspapers at the time, The Telegram and the Bridgeport Post, found that at least 17 voters said they gave their completed ballots to campaign workers for Morton’s challenger, Laurayne Farrar-James, at the time a member of the city council, who died this year at 92. Reporters also found city records indicating a deceased voter cast an absentee ballot and also voted in person on that 1986 Primary Day.</p> <p>Those arrested included a city employee and two residents of the P.T. Barnum housing complex, including the vice president of the tenants’ association. The four didn’t fight the charges, and did not get prison terms. The campaign manager Morton saw with the absentee ballots — John J. McNamara, an attorney — apparently escaped prosecution, claiming that he deposited only office mail in the mailbox.</p> <p>At the time, police investigating the issue had seized only the ballots and let other mail through to get processed at the post office.</p> <p>While only 45 absentee ballots were the focus of that investigation, an anticipated state probe into the city’s recent Sept. 10 primary between Moore and Ganim would likely center on the 1,280 absentees cast, 967 of which went to Ganim and 313 for Moore.</p> <p>Ganim won the election 5,304 to 5,034, according to Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who last week referred the Hearst Connecticut Media reports to the State Elections Enforcement Commission, which is expected on Monday to launch its own probe into the allegations of irregularities.</p> <p>Morton was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1972, at age 48. Eight years later, she became the first African American woman to serve in the state Senate. She retired in 1992 and died in 2012 at 87. In 2012, the City Hall Annex, which houses several city departments, including the registrars’ and mayor’s offices, was named in her honor.</p> <p>Nowadays, the contraction of the U.S. Postal Service has ended same-day delivery within the city of Bridgeport. Mail taken to the Bridgeport post office gets sent to Westchester County, N.Y., for processing, often taking three days to forward a letter mailed in Bridgeport, back to the recipient in Bridgeport.</p> <p>Roach took out 10 absentee ballot applications for the primary, according to city records. He said they were for elderly neighbors of his in Black Rock.</p> <p>kdixon@ctpost.com Twitter: @KenDixonCT</p>",2

The suit, filed in U.S. District Courts for Eastern and Western Districts of Texas, accused Verizon of repeatedly using 12 Huawei patents without permission or, more importantly, paying licensing fees.</p> <p>""Verizon's products and services have benefited from patented technology that Huawei developed over many years of research and development,"" Huawei chief legal officer Dr. Song Liuping said in the statement.</p> <p>Huawei pointed out that it spends a lot of money on research and development, and as such, deserves a cut when its ideas get used elsewhere. According to the Chinese firm, it only seeks a ""legal remedy"" when agreements can't be reached.</p> <p>That sounds fair enough with no other context, but Verizon doesn't see it that way. In a statement to Mashable, Verizon vigorously criticized Huawei's handling of the issue.</p> <p>“Huawei’s lawsuit filed overnight, in the very early morning, is nothing more than a PR stunt. This lawsuit is a sneak attack on our company and the entire tech ecosystem. Huawei’s real target is not Verizon; it is any country or company that defies it. The action lacks merit, and we look forward to vigorously defending ourselves.""</p> <p>This isn't the first time these two companies have gone toe-to-toe on this exact issue. Huawei demanded licensing fees from Verizon less than a year ago, but didn't quite take it to the courts. After Apple and Qualcomm settled their years-long patent infringement case last year, it was probably about time for the tech world to produce another one.</p> <p>Huawei, of course, has been involved in plenty of legal hang-ups in the western world recently. In December, Huawei sued the U.S. government over new FCC regulations on its equipment. In just the past week or so, both the U.S. and E.U. reportedly took steps to box Huawei out of 5G deployment in their respective territories.</p> <p>Wherever this Verizon lawsuit goes, it's safe to say Huawei's already-tenuous footing in the U.S. might not improve in the immediate future.</p>",2

In the meantime, prominent blogger and human rights activist Alaa Abd El Fattah, who goes by just “Alaa” in his community, went on a hunger strike, while arrests and detentions continue.</p> <p>Alaa is currently on a hunger strike to protest his continued detention, his family said in a statement published on April 22.</p> <p>According to the statement, on April 13, a prosecutor's office received a report from the Tora Maximum Security Prison, where Alaa is being held, that he started his hunger strike.</p> <p>On April 22, the family was able to access another report concerning Alaa’s health and hunger strike:</p> <p>Today we were able to see the medical report dated April 18, 2020, which stated that Alaa’s blood sugar level was at 54 mg/dL [milligrams per deciliter], heart rate at 76, blood pressure at 100/70, and that he refused to suspend a glucose drip.</p> <p>This report confirms that Alaa is on a full hunger strike as opposed to the previous report that mentioned that he was only taking liquids, his sister Mona Seif wrote.</p> <p>The prominent blogger and activist has been in and out of prison since 2011. In 2011, he spent two months in prison, missing the birth of his first child, Khaled. In 2013, he was arrested and detained for 115 days without trial.</p> <p>Alaa was arrested and taken from his family’s home in November 2013. More than one year later, in February 2015, he was finally tried and sentenced to five years in prison under a 2013 protest law that prohibits unauthorised demonstrations, for “organising” a protest against military trials. While he did take part in the protest held on November 26, 2013, Alaa had no role in organising it.</p> <p>He was freed from prison on March 28, 2019. However, his freedom was conditional as he was required to be locked up at his local police station from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. under a probation period of five years. Alaa repeatedly spoke out against his conditional release — describing it as a “humiliation.”</p> <p>However, even his “half freedom” did not last.</p> <p>Authorities arrested him again on September 29, 2019, in the midst of a crackdown on rare anti-government protests since the 2013 military coup that toppled the democratically-elected president Mohamed Morsi, who died while in prison on June 17, 2019. Alaa did not take part in those protests, yet he was still arrested. On the night of his arrest, “prison officers blindfolded him, stripped him of his clothing, beat and kicked him repeatedly, and subjected him to threats and verbal abuse,” Amnesty International said.</p> <p>His lawyer, human rights defender Mohammed el-Baqer, was arrested later that same day when he appeared at Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) to represent him. He was also subjected to ill-treatment.</p> <p>They are both being held in the same case on bogus charges of ‘’spreading false news,” “joining an illegal organization,” “receiving foreign funding,” and “misusing social media.”</p> <p>Their detention was last renewed for 45 days on February 20, 2020, at the demand of prosecution. Since then, they have both remained in illegal detention after the 45-day period expired without the renewal of their detention.</p> <p>‘’Since the prosecution’s appeal to renew his detention was accepted on February 20, 2020, Alaa has not attended any further hearings, which makes his continued detention, and that of others with him, unlawful,’’ his family said, adding:</p> <p>Exceptional circumstances do not cancel the rights of those held in temporary custody, nor should they be an excuse to strip them of their rights to counsel and defense.</p> <p>No respite from the crackdown</p> <p>Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the crackdown on political prisoners in Egypt has shown no signs of respite. While the authorities released some prisoners —including 15 politicians and activists— as part of measures to contain the spread of the virus, tens of thousands remain in prison for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, protest and assembly.</p> <p>As of April 26, the country recorded 4,534 COVID-19 cases and 317 deaths, according to official figures. The country’s prisons are crowded and lack hygiene, raising serious concerns over any potential spread of the disease in such conditions.</p> <p>As part of a campaign to release thousands of prisoners, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies tweeted on April 14:</p> <p>#Egypt: As the #Egyptian government imposes a #curfew, it continues to turn a blind eye to the country’s dozens of densely-populated prisons, which are reported to exceed their capacity by over 300%!! #COVID19</p> <p>Sign the petition here:https://t.co/xvIpm54vYJ — CIHRS (@CIHRS_Alerts) April 14, 2020</p> <p>Yet, despite multiple calls to release political prisoners, the detentions and the arrests continue. On April 20, blogger Wael Abbas was arrested while taking photos at Wadi Degla, a nature reserve located 35 kilometers south of the capital, Cairo. Abbas was taking photos for his Facebook page, Planet Egypt 360, where he offers virtual tours of Egypt’s tourist attractions. He was released hours later.</p> <p>In 2018, Abbas spent seven months in prison over fabricated accusations that included “spreading false news,” “involvement with a terrorist group,” and “misuse of social media.”</p> <p>“I have been mistreated and discriminated against because I am a former political activist, although I have stopped my activism,” he said in a Facebook post about his most recent arrest.</p> <p>Under the reign of authoritarian president Abdelfattah Sisi, who led the 2013 coup when he was army chief and defense minister, before claiming the presidency in an election that failed to meet international standards, thousands of people have been imprisoned for peacefully exercising their civil and political rights.</p> <p>Those arrested on politically motivated charges are often subjected to enforced disappearances, torture, prolonged pre-trial detention and solitary confinement. Even under a health crisis like the COVID-19, the ordeal of these prisoners, who should not have been jailed in the first place, continues.</p> <p>Learn about the physiological effects of a hunger strike with the infographic below, created by Global Voices’ partner, Visualizing Impact:</p>",2

1021332525,The Relentless Ego of Ghislaine Maxwell,2021-12-30 23:09:33.183000,"<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of conspiring with her late partner, Jeffrey Epstein, to recruit, groom, and sexually abuse underage girls, during a period spanning from 1994 to 2004. Maxwell, a former socialite and a daughter of the British media mogul Robert Maxwell, who maintained her innocence throughout the trial, was convicted of five of the six charges of which she was accused, and faces up to sixty-five years behind bars. (Judge Alison J. Nathan, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, has yet to set a date for her sentencing.) When the jury announced its verdict, Maxwell, who was wearing a black mask and dark clothing, sat very still. According to the Times, she took a sip of water and touched her face briefly, before being ushered out of the courtroom. At no point did she betray any emotion.</p> <p>For those of us who have been following United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, the defendant’s sangfroid didn’t come as much of a surprise. The trial opened this past November, in Manhattan federal court, more than two years after Epstein, the disgraced financier, was found hanging in his jail cell, where he was awaiting his own trial for allegedly coercing dozens of young women and teen-age girls into sexual acts. In the course of Maxwell’s trial, which was widely seen as a last chance at justice for Epstein’s victims, four women—who were all under the age of eighteen when they first met the pair—testified to Epstein’s sex crimes, which were facilitated by Maxwell, and their words were often harrowing. (“She has caused hurt to many more women than the few of us who had the chance to testify in the courtroom,” one victim said.) And yet, aside from occasionally consulting with her legal team and taking notes, Maxwell remained sphinxlike throughout the trial, expressing no frailty and certainly no regret. One can only assume that this stance did not win her very many points with the jury.</p> <p>Maxwell’s brand of chilly hauteur was on full display, early on, when the socialite, who was being drawn by a courtroom sketch artist, began to sketch the artist back—an act which, in its attempt to reverse the roles, smacked of a certain derision for the gravity of the proceedings around her. The moment, which became something of an Internet meme in the days that followed, also reminded me of Maxwell’s brazen gaze when she was photographed at—or arguably Photoshopped into a picture of—a Los Angeles-area In-N-Out Burger, soon after Epstein’s death. This was a woman who has long acted, and has continued to act, as if she had absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. (Her lead attorney has said that her team is already working on an appeal of the verdict.) When given a chance to explain her side of things, in court, Maxwell declined to take the stand, stating that “the government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and so there is no need for me to testify.”</p> <p>The government’s case, however, was damning. As Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe noted in her closing argument, Maxwell “ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls,” preying on teens who often came from difficult family situations by reassuring them with her presence, acting the part of the “posh, smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman.” (Judging from the stories the victims told on the stand, it seems that Maxwell was able to tone down her arrogant stonewalling when she wanted to.) She offered the girls money and gifts, such as Victoria’s Secret underwear, in return for them giving Epstein “massages,” which were merely a smoke screen for sexual abuse. One victim, testifying under the pseudonym Jane, told the court that, beginning when she was fourteen, Maxwell not only made her feel more comfortable with the increasingly sexualized atmosphere in Epstein’s estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but also actively participated in her abuse. “She, along with others, would just start taking their clothes off,” Jane said. “And Jeffrey would get on the massage table, and it would just, you know, sort of turn into this orgy.”</p> <p>A second victim, testifying under the pseudonym Kate, told the court that when she was seventeen, Maxwell recruited her, under the guise of a friendly favor, to give Epstein a massage, which led to Kate being sexually abused for the next several years. (“She asked me if I had fun and told me that I was such a good girl, and that I was one of his favorites,” Kate said, of Maxwell.) A third woman, who testified under her first name, Carolyn, recounted how, starting at the age of fourteen and continuing until she was eighteen, she would come to Epstein’s Palm Beach estate two or three times a week to give him sexualized massages—appointments that were often scheduled by Maxwell, who would then be present to greet Carolyn on her arrival. On one occasion, Maxwell entered the massage room where Carolyn was standing in the nude: “She came in and felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said that . . . I had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends,” Carolyn testified. She also said that when she confessed to Maxwell that her own grandfather had begun raping her when she was four years old, this revelation didn’t seem to deter Maxwell and Epstein from continuing to abuse her. A fourth woman, Annie Farmer—the only victim who testified under her own full name—spoke of Maxwell’s grooming methods: the socialite bought Farmer, who was sixteen at the time, cowboy boots and engaged her in amiable conversation, and later gave her a sexualized massage at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.</p> <p>Officially, Maxwell was in charge of managing Epstein’s various properties, overseeing tasks from the mundane to the whimsical: Cimberly Espinosa, a former assistant of Maxwell’s at the Epstein office who appeared as a witness for the defense, recalled that, after the financier purchased his Caribbean island, Little Saint James, he was unsatisfied with the amount of sand and palm trees on the premises, and deputized Maxwell to deliver more of both. Both Espinosa and another onetime Epstein office employee, Michelle Healy, who also served as a defense witness, praised Maxwell’s managerial abilities. Maxwell was “fantastic,” Healy said. “She taught me a lot. I respected her. She was tough. But she was great.” Espinosa said that she “learned a lot from her as far as administrative and being able to handle a lot of calls, a lot of duties. It was a very high-volume work.” (Both witnesses denied involvement in any wrongdoing.)</p> <p>As I followed these testimonies to Maxwell’s on-the-ball competence, it struck me that the same acumen that she used in her aboveboard professional life served her just as well in her more private role: that of making sure there was a constant stream of mostly underage girls to fulfill Epstein’s voracious, monstrous sexual appetite. Maxwell’s real job “was to take care of Jeffrey’s needs,” Kate noted, in her testimony. “She said that he needed massages all the time and it was very difficult to keep up.” Later, she added that Maxwell would ask her if she “knew anybody who could come and give Jeffrey a blow job because . . . it was a lot for her to do.” The jokiness of the question concealed a steely discipline. In the household manual Maxwell distributed to employees at Epstein’s properties, she “wrote out a detailed list of thirteen different oils and lotions for massages in Palm Beach,” Moe said, while in the phone book that Maxwell shared with Epstein, she kept a running list of dozens of available masseuses, some of them accompanied with notations such as “mom,” “dad,” or “parents,” suggesting that these were not professional bodyworkers but amateur minors. In his testimony for the prosecution, Juan Alessi, who was in charge of managing Epstein’s Palm Beach house, was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey about Maxwell’s household manual. From cleaning instructions to meal-serving etiquette and privacy concerns—“remember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing,” the manual read—Maxwell had “many, many, many rules,” Alessi said. Comey asked Alessi if he had seen any females coming into Epstein’s Palm Beach house in the years he worked there. “Many, many, many females,” he responded.</p>",2
