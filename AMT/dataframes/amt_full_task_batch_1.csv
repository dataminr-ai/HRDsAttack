923260635,Harut Sassounian։ Libya’s interim government recognizes the Armenian Genocide once again,2020-05-13 00:00:00,"<p>Libya’s Interim Government recognized the Armenian Genocide on April 24, 2020, for the second year in a row. On April 19, 2019 the provisional government had issued a similar recognition.</p> <p>While this recognition may surprise many people because there is hardly a single Armenian living in Libya, there are, however, geopolitical reasons for taking such an action. Ever since the toppling and killing in 2012 of Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, the country has been in constant turmoil with various military factions fighting each other to rule Libya.</p> <p>The officially recognized government of Libya is limited around coastal Tripoli and Misrata, while most of the Libyan territory is occupied by the Interim Government led by military leader Khalifa Haftar. The internal civil war has been considerably expanded by the interference of external powers in Libya’s domestic affairs. Turkey and Qatar have supported the Central Government with Islamic fighters and military hardware, while the Interim Government has been endorsed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p> <p>The countries on the opposing sides in Libya are also involved in diplomatic clashes and mass media wars. Last month Saudi Arabia announced that it was blocking access to Turkish news agencies and websites. In return, Turkey blocked Saudi and Emirati news outlets. Furthermore, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan supports the Muslim Brotherhood, while Saudi Arabia, Egypt and UAE are opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt and Turkey have been feuding ever since the pro-Muslim Brotherhood President of Egypt Mohammed Morsi, supported by Turkey, was toppled in 2013. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and UAE have asked their citizens to boycott Turkish products and travel to Turkey.</p> <p>These various regional and internal feuds have prompted the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the Libyan Interim Government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on April 24, 2020. Here is the text of the announcement translated into English:</p> <p>“We recall today the genocide of the Armenian population by Turkey which falls on April 24 of each year. The State of Libya commemorates this anniversary in implementation of Government Decision No. 238 of 2019, which approved this day as a national day to revive it.</p> <p>“Turkey’s criminal actions against the Armenian people by burning, deliberate killing, forced deportation, and other ugly acts contrary to all divine laws is a crime against humanity and it must be recognized and granted an official apology to the Armenian people and compensate them for the pains that these massacres have caused which cannot be forgotten from the memory of Armenians and the whole world. As we condemn this crime devoid of any element of humanity, we again call upon the countries of the world to recognize this heinous crime.</p> <p>“It is today’s Turkish government, in its new situation, which commits crimes against the peoples of the world by its blatant interference in their internal affairs. Perhaps what it carried out yesterday by bombarding the city of Tarhuna [Libya] with missiles and drones, killing children, the elderly and women, destroying humanitarian convoys, food and medical aid, fuel tanks, bringing in mercenaries and supporting terrorists are other crimes added to a chain of Turkish crimes against people and confirms to the whole world the extent of Erdogan's arrogance and his disregard for all international laws and norms.”</p> <p>On April 19, 2019, the Libyan Interim Government had issued a similar statement through its Foreign Ministry which reads as follows:</p> <p>“The Interim Government officially adopted a resolution in March recognizing the Armenian Genocide.</p> <p>“On 24 April 1915, the Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported from Constantinople (now Istanbul) to the region of Ankara, 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders, the majority of whom were eventually murdered.</p> <p>“This was followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian Desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.</p> <p>“The final death toll of the genocide is reported to be 1.5 million.”</p> <p>It should not be surprising that the Libyan Interim Government has issued a statement on the Armenian Genocide because it serves its anti-Turkish political agenda. It would have been more surprising if such an announcement would be made contrary to its own interests.</p> <p>All countries cater to their national interests. The Armenian government must also act in a similar manner. Libya is a good example. This is the second year in a row that its Interim Government has recognized the Armenian Genocide. What has been the reaction of the Armenian Government? We are not aware of any public comment to this effect. Wouldn’t it be proper for the Armenian Foreign Ministry to issue a statement welcoming the Libyan announcement? Someday the Interim Government may become the legally recognized government of Libya. Now is the time for Armenia to establish friendly relations with Libya. As Turkey has been isolating Armenia from its neighbors by its blockade and its anti-Armenian economic and diplomatic efforts, Armenia in response should join hands with supportive countries and isolate Turkey to whatever degree it can.</p> <p>By establishing good relations with the Libyan Interim Government, Armenia would also be in a good position to affirm its relations with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and mend its non-existent relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I am sure these countries would appreciate the friendly hand extended by the Government of Armenia.</p> <p>By Harut Sassounian</p> <p>Publisher, The California Courier</p> <p>www.thecaliforniacourier.com</p>",1
1023846807,Abba Kyari: The Link Between Hushpuppi And Obi Cubana By Richard Odusanya,2022-01-18 00:00:00,"<p>Mahatma Gandi during his days said; ""Behaviour is the mirror in which we can display our image"". Today, cybercrime and drug peddling is now an automatic indictment of both the average Nigerian and Nigeria’s character, just as our comatose international image lies critically at the selective mercy of western propaganda.</p> <p>Nigeria, a country where a retired 'DIG' Sen. Nuhu Aliyu of the blessed memory, a one time Senator from Niger State once stood in the Senate Chambers and said, ""There are armed robbers in this chamber."" He pointedly said that there are many senators that have no business sitting in the hallow chamber.</p> <p>A country where a man who was dismissed from the police service for gross misconduct, later emerged from the underworld as kingpin to become a governor of State. A country where a man standing trial for the gruesome assassination of the same country's Minister of Justice and Attorney General, won a seat in the senate from prison. I can go on and on.</p> <p>This could be attributed to the collapse of values in the Nigerian society, and generally, to the effect of poverty and how that pushes the people to desperate ends. Materialism and consumerism must be checked.</p> <p>Richard Odusanya</p> <p>A one-time Nigerian social media 'celebrity', Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, was arrested in Dubai in June 2020 on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.</p> <p>Husspuppi's international ""Crime"" was later linked to many people by the American FBI, including Abba Kyari. To date, we haven't heard anything on DCP Abba Kyari who was indicted by the FBI on some allegations of money laundering, bribery and wire fraud, vis-a-vis receiving funds from Hushpuppi.</p> <p>How a high ranking Police Officer, an award winning 'Super Cop' and Intelligence Officer for that matter, could be associated with a criminal like Hushpuppi and openly fraternising with characters like Cubana for whatever reason, even if it is for tailoring services or social engagement as DCP Kyari claimed still leaves me bewildered.</p> <p>Abba Kyari's allegation is similar to that of Obi Iyiegbu, popularly called Obi Cubana, his ""Man Friday"" who the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) interrogated last week over the payment of three different tranches of money by drug pushers convicted in New Delhi, India; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Lagos, Nigeria, into his various bank accounts.</p> <p>Before July 2021, the 46-year-old nightlife entrepreneur remained blurred from the radar of the public until the carnival-like funeral of his mother on July 16, 2021.</p> <p>The moment Obi Cubana over-exposed himself, it's no brainer even for a layman to know it was only a matter of time before the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) starts digging into his finances. As a matter of fact, he was detained on November 1, 2021 over allegations of money laundering and tax fraud.</p> <p>After watching American series like 'Power' and 'Ozark', one would realize that most 'successful' club businesses are actually fronts for laundering 'dirty' money from ill-gotten wealth. So yeah, it could be that Obi Cubana is just a front. I am not saying he is guilty of anything, but if he is, he won't be the first; the likes of Quilox are sitting on that table as well.</p> <p>Suffice to say that no iota of success or failure of the Nigerian is without the asterisk of potential criminality, rooted in a culture where many young people see fraud as the only way to make money. On deeper reflection, it epitomises the present spirit of Nigeria’s younger generation.</p> <p>The crazy way millions of Nigerian youths idolise get-rich-quick celebrities has fuelled crimes such as Yahoo-Yahoo, ritualism, kidnapping, drug peddling, armed robbery etc.</p> <p>The get-rich-quick syndrome has become a deified, noticeable trend mostly exhibited, to varying degrees, across social media platforms. Exotic cars are flaunted, designer wears rocked, glittering accessories are customary looks across verified pages and profiles, as if to separate those that have “made it” from those trying to stay as legitimate and clean as the strength of their manhood and the integrity of their professional crafts entail.</p> <p>Fundamentally, it is time for us to interrogate our value system. It is time for us to look at some issues deeply, including materialism and consumerism; and change to productive nation. It is time to stop demarketing our youths and face the real issue which is our value system.</p> <p>To do this, is to reexamine the erroneous one-way-street perception of criminal acts, which is to call out the failures of both the leaders and the led. To do this, is to admit the failed Nigerian socio-economic and political systems, and to rebuild them on the foundations of integrity, transparency, truth, and justice.</p> <p>Until we do so, the Hushpuppis, Abba Kyaris and Obi Cubanas of our society will continue to dent our collective image with their ""criminal and questionable"" acts. Until we do so, the younger generation will continue to look up to them as role models and answers to the questions Nigeria fails to address.</p> <p>ARISE 'O COMPATRIOTS</p> <p>Richard Odusanya is a Social Reform Crusader and the convener of AFRICA COVENANT RESCUE INITIATIVE ACRI.</p>",1
947686032,Persecution of dissident journalist Hopewell Chin’ono...,2020-09-20 00:00:00,"<p>A Zimbabwean national, Hlevani Matikiti protests across the entrance to University of Johannesburg at the funeral of the Late Andrew Mlangeni against the arrest of Zimbabwean journalists on July 29, 2020 in Soweto, South Africa. Photo by Gallo Images/Fani Mahuntsi)</p> <p>On 20 July 2020 a group of armed law enforcement officials broke into the home of award-winning Zimbabwean journalist and filmmaker Hopewell Chin’ono, and abducted him.</p> <p>Chin’ono managed to capture the first few seconds of his abduction on video.</p> <p>In the video, there’s a knock on the door to the room in which Chin’ono seems to be waiting, ready for his assailants, armed with his phone camera. When the door opens, a man aggressively shouts an order at Chin’ono to put down his phone. Another man visibly quickly steps back, clearly trying to get out of view of the camera, but not quickly enough. Chin’ono delays putting down the phone and they again yell at him: “Put it down!” He finally complies and for a while that was the last we saw of him as a free man.</p> <p>When his lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, got to his house, she was confronted by the evidence of the break-in and posted a video showing a broken glass door through which the abductors allegedly gained entrance.</p> <p>After his abduction, Chin’ono was taken to a local police station and charged with trumped-up accusations of inciting violence for planned 31 July protests against corruption. Jacob Ngarivhume, the opposition leader who called for the protests, was also arrested.</p> <p>Zimbabweans have no doubt whatsoever that Chin’ono is being persecuted for having been among the journalists who exposed looting of Covid-19 funds, scuppering a $60-million deal that would allegedly have benefited, among others, President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his sons. Because of the exposé, the procurement deal was cancelled and the minister of health fired, a move many wrote off as apparent scapegoating.</p> <p>At some point during Chin’ono’s incarceration, George Charamba, the president’s spokesman, posted this on his Twitter page:</p> <p>“Al Jazeera’s Hussein detained in Egyptian prison for 1,000 days … One Egyptian journalist working for Al Jazeera has been languishing in jail for over 1,000 days. Meanwhile even Al Jazeera’s perfunctory campaign for him has grown fatigued. The West is dead silent, and won’t care a hoot. But the message has been driven home: you do not tamper with Egyptian institutions of State in the name of MEDIA FREEDOM or that of GLOBAL NEWS NETWORKS hoping IT CAN’T!!…”</p> <p>We took it as a threat that Chin’ono and Ngarivhume were, like the Egyptian journalist, also going to be kept in prison for a long time, and indeed they were.</p> <p>Chin’ono and Ngarivhume were remanded in custody for a crime they did not commit. They were incarcerated at Chikurubi Prison where they experienced abuse at the hands of prison officials, who at some point denied them access to basic prisoners’ rights such as food from visitors, warm clothing and private consultations with lawyers.</p> <p>Prison officials told Chin’ono and his lawyers that they had been instructed to never leave his side and to sit in on all his consultations with his lawyers. When they fought against this, Ngoni Nduna, the magistrate tasked with Chin’ono’s hearing, accused Mtetwa of posting details about the case on Facebook and demanded she be removed from the case.</p> <p>This despite the fact that the Facebook page he cited was a Beatrice Mtetwa fan page, run by a fan who confessed to registering and running it. The courts went on to ban Mtetwa from representing Chin’ono – a move clearly meant to frustrate him, delay his bail hearing and deny him the right to a lawyer of his choice.</p> <p>After a month and a half of incarceration, Ngarivhume and Chin’ono were finally granted bail with stringent conditions. They are not to leave Harare and were banned from Twitter.</p> <p>A lot about Chin’ono’s and Ngarivhume’s cases feels like déja vu. It is eerily similar to Jestina Mukoko’s ordeal at the hands of the same perpetrators more than 12 years ago.</p> <p>The way they broke into Chin’ono’s home and abducted him without an arrest warrant speaks to the probability that he was a candidate for enforced disappearance, the regime’s favourite way of dealing with dissenters. I believe that had Chin’ono not managed to make a live recording of his abduction, the state would have denied taking him.</p> <p>On 3 December 2008, 15 armed men broke into the Norton home of Mukoko, the director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), a journalist and human rights defender. After news of her arrest got out, the government denied taking her. She was detained incommunicado until 24 December 2008, when she was produced at Harare Magistrate’s Court.</p> <p>During her enforced disappearance Mukoko had been subjected to inhumane treatment including but not limited to being locked in a freezer, simulated drowning and beatings.</p> <p>Instead of freeing Mukoko after producing her, for she had broken not even a single Zimbabwean law, the government remanded her in custody on trumped-up charges of “recruiting persons for training as insurgents or saboteurs”.</p> <p>They eventually released her on bail in March 2009, after she had spent three months in custody. Her bail conditions were that she had to report at the local police station in Norton every Friday. She also had to surrender her passport. This went on until September 2009 when the Supreme Court ordered a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings against Mukoko.</p> <p>Nobody was ever held personally responsible and punished for her abduction, enforced disappearance, torture, wrongful arrest and many other crimes committed against her and the 23 activists she says she was tortured with. However, in 2018 the High Court of Zimbabwe ordered the state to pay $150,000 in compensation for the abduction, enforced disappearance and torture she was subjected to by state security agents.</p> <p>Just like Chin’ono, while in custody, Mukoko was denied adequate health care, reportedly going for at least 10 days without her allergy medication, and was at some point prescribed anxiety and insomnia medication by an army doctor who had, ironically, also taken part in her torture.</p> <p>The government of Zimbabwe has been committing violent crimes against citizens from as long ago as 1980, when it waged war on the opposition, Zapu, and went on to kill more than 20,000 civilians in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces, the Zapu stronghold. The operation was called Gukurahundi and many people were abducted, disappeared and tortured.</p> <p>We all thought things would change now that former president Robert Mugabe has gone, but evidence shows that instead, government is escalating its violence.</p> <p>For four decades, the Zanu-PF government has denied abducting civilians. It has always been a case of the victims’ word against the government.</p> <p>In May this year, three women from the main opposition party, the MDC Alliance, were arrested at a police roadblock and taken to Harare Central Police Station, from where they were abducted and disappeared for days. Cecilia Chimbiri, Joana Mamombe and Netsai Marova were dumped outside Harare a few days later, having been physically and psychologically tortured. Police denied ever arresting them, despite the fact that on the day of their arrest, police spokesperson Paul Nyathi admitted to two newspapers that indeed they had arrested the three women.</p> <p>They instead rearrested them at the hospital where they were being treated for torture, and charged them with faking abduction. Like Mukoko, they were eventually granted bail, but with punitively strict conditions. Among their bail conditions were orders to report three times a week at Harare Central Police Station, surrender their passports to court authorities and not to interfere with witnesses. They were ordered to continue staying at the addresses given to law enforcement agents upon their arrest and barred from communicating with the media on anything to do with the alleged offence. They were also banned from social media.</p> <p>The government, on the other hand, continues to abuse the three on social media and state-controlled media, accusing them of having faked their abduction. The women have no way of defending themselves as they were banned from commenting on the case. Last week, the government aired clearly doctored footage of what they claimed was evidence that the three women were out and about during the time of their abduction.</p> <p>In what many Zimbabweans have dismissed as a shoddy propaganda job, the government’s footage shows a car they claim is the Mercedes Benz the victims had been in. However, close inspection of the car in the video shows that it is a BMW. The footage also shows a Mercedes-Benz with its fuel tank on the left side, but later shows “the same car” with the tank on the right side. This has Zimbabweans convinced that the fact that the government had to go to such great lengths to doctor footage and air it on national TV instead of producing it in court as the trial is ongoing, is clear evidence that they have no case against the three women.</p> <p>For four decades, the Zanu-PF government has denied abducting civilians. It has always been a case of the victims’ word against the government.</p> <p>But for the first time in 40 years, the government was caught on camera, abducting my book research assistant, 22-year-old journalism student and activist Tawanda Muchehiwa. I will write more about this in an upcoming article.</p> <p>In all these cases, the collusion to obstruct justice between government institutions in the persecution of the opposition, human rights defenders and dissenters is glaring. In all the cases, armed forces abduct victims on behalf of government and either disappear and torture them first before dumping them at police stations, or victims are arrested by police and abducted from police custody by agents who go on to disappear and torture them. Those that survive being disappeared are tortured while in the custody of prison officials. All of them are then denied bail for a while and eventually granted bail, but with unreasonable conditions. After some months, the cases are thrown out of court.</p> <p>This shows beyond reasonable doubt the extent to which the state is captured. The Central Intelligence Organisation, the judiciary, the department of prisons, the army and the police have been completely captured by Zanu-PF. Instead of serving and protecting the people of Zimbabwe, they are being used to oppress us. DM/MC</p> <p>Thandekile Moyo is a writer and human rights defender from Zimbabwe.

899609585,Richard Pryor’s Drug Addiction: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know,2020-01-16 23:57:25,"<p>Richard Pryor is widely recognized as one of the greatest comedy icons the world has had to offer, but that in no way means it was smooth sailing when it came to Pryor’s career and personal life. For decades, the comedian and actor struggled with drugs and alcohol, and those close to him have gone on to share stories about Pryor’s substance abuse problems since his passing in 2005.</p> <p>Read on to learn more about Pryor’s struggle with drugs and alcohol, and what his friends and family have had to say about it.</p> <p>1. Wife Jennifer Lee Moved out After Discovering Pryor Was Freebasing Cocaine</p> <p>In a 2013 interview with BBC, Pryor’s wife at the time of his death, Jennifer Lee, shared that she moved out of his home once she discovered he was freebasing cocaine.</p> <p>“After two weeks of watching him getting addicted to this stuff I moved out. It was clear the drug had moved in and it had become his lover and everything. I did not exist.”</p> <p>Despite Pryor’s drug addiction, the pair later married, although the relationship was tumultuous.</p> <p>In an interview with ABC after Pryor’s death, Lee said, “He was a real piece of work. He was a handful, and a wonderful handful, and a heartbreaker and the love of my life.” She continued, “He had a very dark side that could strike out and be very volatile at any moment. He was incredibly loving and vulnerable. When I met him, the thing that struck me most about him was his vulnerability. And I can tell you many women say this about him, that there was something so open and raw and refreshing about him.”</p> <p>2. Prior Opened up About Being Sexually Abused as a Child</p> <p>Pryor was born in 1940 in Peoria, Illinois, and grew up in a brothel that was run by his grandmother. There, his mother was a prostitute, according to the New York Post.</p> <p>When he was seven, according to USA Today, Pryor was sexually abused in an alleyway.</p> <p>At age 14, he was kicked out of school. He was 16 when he had his first child with a girl who was also sleeping with his father.</p> <p>Unbound reports that Pryor “seems to have seen more as a child than most do in their lifetime.” The outlet goes on to write, “After being raped by a teenage neighbour, sexually abused by a priest and losing his cherry to a hooker called Penny, Pryor found he had a flair for comedy.”</p> <p>3. He Was Arrested for Drunk Driving in 1978</p> <p>In 1978, Pryor was arrested for drunk driving and sentenced to five months in jail.</p> <p>That wasn’t his only stint in jail.</p> <p>Pryor was also arrested after a physical confrontation with a woman who he was friends with, who would sing in local clubs. Pittsburgh Magazine writes, “Pittsburgh police quietly arrested him on Jan. 1, 1963, at the Wylie Avenue boarding house where he was staying. He was sentenced to 90 days for attacking the woman and undoubtedly had to walk across the famed ‘Bridge of Sighs’ from the Allegheny County Courthouse to the jail. He was supposed to be there for three months but played numbers games while incarcerated and won $70 — enough to pay his fine. He was released after 35 days.”</p> <p>After being released, Pryor moved to New York. Within two years, his career had taken off. Still, Pryor struggled with substance abuse.</p> <p>A 1978 People article by Sue Reilly reads, “He was snorting $100 of cocaine a day, had been arrested for assault and battery, sued for wife-beating, and accused of stabbing a landlord with a fork and of beating a hotel clerk.”</p> <p>4. He Set Himself on Fire While Freebasing Cocaine in 1978</p> <p>Play</p> <p>The Infamous Richard Pryor burn incident. This is a segment from the show Autopsy : The Final 24 Hours of Richard Pryor explaining what exactly happened when Richard suffered burns over 50% of his body. Over the years, precise details were up for debate but this is eyewitness accounts which Richard confirmed a time later. Enjoy!! 2019-02-04T03:51:35.000Z</p> <p>Not long after being arrested for drunk driving, Pryor’s famous ‘fire incident’ occurred.</p> <p>It was June 9, 1980, and Pryor poured rum over himself and proceeded to light himself on fire. At the time, according to The Washington Examiner, he was freebasing cocaine.</p> <p>The outlet writes, “His daughter said her father was in a drug-induced psychosis and poured rum over his body and set himself on fire.”</p> <p>The comedian was given a 1-in-3 chance of living and was lucky to survive. He suffered severe burns that covered more than 50% of his body, according to People.</p> <p>Last year, while being interviewed by the documentary I Am Richard Pryor, Lee stated that the incident was a suicide attempt. She told People, “He warned me…He said to me, ‘I’ve decided what to do. I have to do this otherwise I don’t know how I’m going to get out. There’s no way out of this so you need to leave so you don’t get hurt too.’ I knew he was planning something, I didn’t know what. I called the house. Somebody answered and then the next thing I know they drop the phone and I heard someone screaming, and Richard at that time running through the house on fire.”</p> <p>5. He Was Diagnosed With MS in 1986</p> <p>Pryor was diagnosed with MS in 1986 while filming the movie “Critical Condition in LA.”</p> <p>Unbound reports him as saying of his illness, “It was as if God had all this shit left over from the other afflictions he created and decided to throw it all into one disease called MS. Kinda like a Saturday Night Special. It’s a motherfucker.”</p> <p>On December 10, 2005, Richard Pryor suffered a heart attack and died. His wife at the time, Lee, told news outlets, “He did not suffer, he went quickly and at the end there was a smile on his face.”</p> <p>She added, “I’m honoured now that I have an opportunity to protect and continue his legacy because he’s a very, very, very amazing man and he opened doors to so many people.”</p> <p>READ NEXT: Jennifer Lee, Richard Pryor’s Widow: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know</p>",1

Like the case of Steven Jean Hoover, a 50-year-old computer programmer who starved himself to death in his Clairemont condominium in 1995.</p> <p>And before all that, Rother was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where the La Jolla High School graduate majored in psychology and laid the groundwork for the career she did not see coming.</p> <p>“I am interested in why people act the way they do. I am always wondering, ‘Why do people do this?’” Rother, 58, said during a phone interview from her home in Kensington.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“I was thinking of being a therapist. At Berkeley, Psychology of the Brain was one of my favorite classes. And then I took Abnormal Psychology, and I thought, ‘This is too much. I can’t do this every day.’ And this is what I do now. I am basically doing abnormal psychology every day.”</p> <p>Since 2004, Rother has written or co-written 14 books, most of them nonfiction accounts of real-life crimes. That lineup includes 2005’s “Poisoned Love,” Rother’s look at the made-for-tabloid TV case of San Diego toxicologist Kristin Rossum, who was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of her husband. In 2012’s “Lost Girls,” Rother wrote about the heartbreaking deaths of Amber Dubois and Chelsea King, two San Diego teenagers who were killed by convicted sex offender John Albert Gardner III.</p> <p>Rother’s new book comes out on April 27. On the surface, it looks like another true-crime saga. Except for the fact that the death Rother writes about may not have been the result of a criminal act.</p> <p>The book is “Death on Ocean Boulevard: Inside the Coronado Mansion Case.” The case concerns the mysterious death of Rebecca Zahau, whose body was found hanging from a balcony at the historic Spreckels Mansion in Coronado in July of 2011. Her body was naked, and her hands and feet were bound.</p> <p>Zahau’s death happened just two days after 6-year-old Max Shacknai, the son of her boyfriend, Jonah Shaknai, took what turned out to be a fatal fall while Max was in the house with her. Investigators from the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department ruled that Zahau’s death was a suicide. Her family believes she was killed.</p> <p>In 2018, a San Diego Superior Court jury found Jonah Shacknai’s brother, Adam Shacknai, responsible for Zahau’s death. Later that year, the Sheriff’s Department reviewed the investigation and concluded once again that Zahau’s death was a suicide. Just last month, a San Diego Superior Court judge agreed to hear arguments from Zahau’s family that they should be allowed to see investigative materials that the Sheriff’s Department did not make public.</p> <p>A death that doesn’t seem to make sense as a suicide or a murder makes for a puzzle that people can’t stop trying to solve. The Coronado mansion story has been covered by CNN Headline News and the Oxygen and Investigation Discovery cable networks. It has also become a breeding ground for a wealth of conspiracy theories.</p> <p>And even after her years of research and many hours of interviews — including nearly 16 hours of Skype interviews with Jonah Shacknai that didn’t come through until the book was being edited — Rother herself can’t say for sure what happened.</p> <p>“My agent pressed me to take a position, and I just wasn’t comfortable with doing that,” said Rother, who is working on a sequel to her first (and only) novel, “Naked Addiction,” a mystery set in La Jolla and Pacific Beach. “I went back and forth and I did a lot of investigating, and I don’t know what happened. I can see both sides of it, and I have never been convinced either way. There are big holes in the investigation that will never be filled.”</p> <p>For Rother, there was another way in which “Death on Ocean Boulevard” was more than another true-crime story.</p> <p>In 1999, after years struggling with alcoholism and mental illness, Rother’s husband, Rich Rose, hanged himself in a motel room in Mexico. Rose’s death, which Rother wrote about in her frank 2018 memoir, “Secrets, Lies, and Shoelaces,” gave her firsthand insights into the mysteries of being human. Including the mystery of why people go to such great lengths to hide their pain from the ones they love most.</p> <p>Rother talks about Rose’s death in the new book, and her insights helped her write a full, empathetic profile of Zahau as well as a detailed accounting of her death, baffling complexities and all. In return, the process of researching and writing about the death on Ocean Boulevard helped her come to terms with the death in the motel room in San Quintín, Mexico.</p> <p>You can’t always know why people do what they do, but in “Death on Ocean Boulevard,” Rother reminds us of how much you can learn by doing your best to find out.</p> <p>“This is not a parlor game. It isn’t about judging,” said Rother, who dedicated the book to Max and Rebecca. “Rebecca’s family still cannot let go of this case, and they are not going to until they get the death certificate changed. And the Shaknais lost a little boy. This is a tragedy, no matter how you look at it.”</p> <p>Caitlin Rother will discuss “Death on Ocean Boulevard” with journalist J.W. August at 7 p.m. Tuesday, April 27, in a virtual event presented by the San Diego Public Library. Register at: https://sandiego.librarymarket.com/events/caitlin-rother-book-launch</p>",1

But many Afghans, especially women, are deeply skeptical and fear a rollback of rights gained over the last two decades. (AP Photo/Kathy Gannon)</p> <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Taliban special forces in camouflage fired their weapons into the air Saturday, bringing an abrupt and frightening end to the latest protest march in the capital by Afghan women demanding equal rights from the new rulers.</p> <p>Also on Saturday, the chief of Pakistan’s powerful intelligence agency, which has an outsized influence on the Taliban, made a surprise visit to Kabul.</p> <p>Taliban fighters quickly captured most of Afghanistan last month and celebrated the departure of the last U.S. forces after 20 years of war. The insurgent group must now govern a war-ravaged country that is heavily reliant on international aid.</p> <p>The women’s march — the second in as many days in Kabul — began peacefully. Demonstrators laid a wreath outside Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry to honor Afghan soldiers who died fighting the Taliban before marching on to the presidential palace.</p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> <p>“We are here to gain human rights in Afghanistan,” said 20-year-old protester Maryam Naiby. “I love my country. I will always be here.”</p> <p>As the protesters’ shouts grew louder, several Taliban officials waded into the crowd to ask what they wanted to say.</p> <p>Flanked by fellow demonstrators, Sudaba Kabiri, a 24-year-old university student, told her Taliban interlocutor that Islam’s Prophet gave women rights and they wanted theirs. The Taliban official promised women would be given their rights but the women, all in their early 20s, were skeptical.</p> <p>As the demonstrators reached the presidential palace, a dozen Taliban special forces ran into the crowd, firing in the air and sending demonstrators fleeing. Kabiri, who spoke to The Associated Press, said they also fired tear gas.</p> <p>The Taliban have promised an inclusive government and a more moderate form of Islamic rule than when they last ruled the country from 1996 to 2001. But many Afghans, especially women, are deeply skeptical and fear a roll back of rights gained over the last two decades.</p> <p>For much of the past two weeks, Taliban officials have been holding meetings among themselves, amid reports of differences among them emerging. Early on Saturday, neighboring Pakistan’s powerful intelligence chief Gen. Faiez Hameed made a surprise visit to Kabul. It wasn’t immediately clear what he had to say to the Taliban leadership but the Pakistani intelligence service has a strong influence on the Taliban.</p> <p>The Taliban leadership had its headquarters in Pakistan and were often said to be in direct contact with the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency. Although Pakistan routinely denied providing the Taliban military aid, the accusation was often made by the Afghan government and Washington.</p> <p>Faiez’ visit comes as the world waits to see what kind of government the Taliban will eventually announce, seeking one that is inclusive and ensures protection of women’s rights and the country’s minorities.</p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> <p>The Taliban have promised a broad-based government and have held talks with former president Hamid Karzai and the former government’s negotiation chief Abdullah Abdullah. But the makeup of the new government is uncertain and it was unclear whether hard-line ideologues among the Taliban will win the day — and whether the rollbacks feared by the demonstrating women will occur.</p> <p>Taliban members whitewashed murals Saturday that promoted health care, warned of the dangers of HIV and even paid homage to some of Afghanistan’s iconic foreign contributors, like anthropologist Nancy Dupree, who singlehandedly chronicled Afghanistan’s rich cultural legacy. It was a worrying sign of attempts to erase reminders of the past 20 years.</p> <p>The murals were replaced with slogans congratulating Afghans on their victory.</p> <p>A Taliban cultural commission spokesman, Ahmadullah Muttaqi, tweeted that the murals were painted over “because they are against our values. They were spoiling the minds of the mujahedeen and instead we wrote slogans that will be useful to everyone.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the young women demonstrators said they have had to defy worried families to press ahead with their protests, even sneaking out of their homes to take their demands for equal rights to the new rulers.</p> <p>Farhat Popalzai, another 24-year-old university student, said she wanted to be the voice of Afghanistan’s voiceless women, those too afraid to come out on the street.</p> <p>“I am the voice of the women who are unable to speak.” she said. “They think this is a man’s country but it is not, it is a woman’s country too.”</p> <p>Popalzai and her fellow demonstrators are too young to remember the Taliban rule that ended in 2001 with the U.S.-led invasion. The say their fear is based on the stories they have heard of women not being allowed to go to school and work.</p> <p>Naiby, the 20-year-old, has already operated a women’s organization and is a spokesperson for Afghanistan’s Paralympics. She reflected on the tens of thousands of Afghans who rushed to Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport to escape Afghanistan after the Taliban overran the capital on Aug. 15.</p> <p>“They were afraid,” but for her she said, the fight is in Afghanistan.</p>",1

907181142,Anna Tuckett looks at the importance of the BBC and local journalism,2020-02-20 05:00:00,"<p>By launching a consultation on decriminalising the non-payment of the BBC licence fee, the government has added fuel to the fire that is the debate about how our national broadcaster operates, and whether or not it should be reformed. Whatever your views on the BBC’s future, you will find plenty of analysis and opinion. There are many articles that have already been written on this subject and no doubt a lot more will be said over the next weeks and months. My hope is that the high quality of much of its output will be maintained: as someone who spent many years abroad, I know that the BBC is still the envy of the world and one of Britain’s biggest soft power assets. Comparing it to streaming services such as Netflix is absolute nonsense.</p> <p>What is often missing from discussions about the media landscape in Britain is the state of local media. And it is not good: since 2005, there has been a net loss of 245 local newspapers, and tens of thousands of jobs. As social media companies have continued to snatch advertising revenue from print newspapers, their circulation has fallen dramatically. The BBC currently funds local reporters and pools its resources with competitors to cover local news. If its funding is cut, it may no longer be able to do it.</p> <p>This should worry us all, not just journalists: how will scrutiny of local authorities work in a world without local media? A social media company is not going to step in and send its employees to report from a magistrate court or county council. Local papers have long been the place where some of the best reporters learnt their craft, so while you can argue that the cream always rises to the top, if you reduce the number of places where aspiring young journalists can develop their skills and make a living, many will simply do something else.</p> <p>National papers have fought back, with some success: The Times and the Sunday Times have more than 300,000 digital subscribers, and the Guardian recorded an operating profit for 2018-19, its first such profit in two decades. But they are facing a challenge of attracting new, younger subscribers who don’t remember a pre-internet world and may not understand how crucial the Fourth Estate – the press – is to upholding a healthy democracy. Investigative journalism fulfils the essential function of holding the powerful to account and exposing scandals and corruption, at both national and local level. Oppressive regimes always crack down on independent media, imprison journalists and control public broadcasters, because journalism’s core value is impartiality. All citizens, most of all politicians, need to hear diverse views, not just the views of which they approve.</p> <p>So what’s to be done? The generation now reaching adulthood, dubbed Generation Z, are ‘digital natives’, who have little exposure to established news organisations. They are more familiar with YouTube, than the BBC – the average age of BBC One viewer is 61. As is so often the case, the answer is, in my opinion, education. Young people need to be taught the benefits of supporting and paying for good quality journalism. If we lose it, we will regret it.</p>",1

Sixteenth District Circuit Judge Lee Coleman compromised on his sentence Friday morning between Beck’s attorney, Mark Cliett of Starkville’s, request of the minimum 20 years and the victim’s request of life in prison.</p> <p>Beck was arrested in Tennessee hours after he entered the Cracker Barrel on 18th Avenue at around 4 p.m. on June 22, 2018. The restaurant had about 10 employees and a handful of customers in it at the time of the shooting, District Attorney Scott Colom said during Friday’s sentencing hearing.</p> <p>Beck was a former employee of Cracker Barrel and had previously been in a dating relationship with another employee and went to the restaurant that day to find her. By the day of the shooting, he had been banned from the restaurant.</p> <p>Both Beck and the shooting victim, Stafford Shaw, testified Friday.</p> <p>Beck said he wasn’t in control of himself when he shot Shaw, saying he’d been on drugs earlier that day.</p> <p>“It was the stupidest thing I ever did in my life,” he said.</p> <p>“I want to tell Mr. Shaw, the Court, the whole city of Columbus that I’m sorry,” he added later. “It was me but it wasn’t me. That’s not my character.”</p> <p>Shaw said at the time of the shooting he was a father-to-be and that his injuries still affect him today.</p> <p>“(Beck) should get the maximum (sentence),” he said. “…I’ve got a son. He was five months in the womb at that time. … I don’t see why this happened to me.”</p> <p>The Dispatch will update this story in Sunday’s edition.</p>",1

Your officers and men have, under your watch, performed wonderfully well in the investigation of the most horrific and heinous crime so far. The family1 of the victim hereby appreciate you and commend your gallant and intelligent officers for the sterling performance and startling revelations and progress so far.</p> <p>“Our clients have however informed us and we understand that since the commencement of investigation into the dastardly act which has been linked to the owners and management of the Hilton Top Hotel, Ile-Ife, the exhumation of the decomposing body of the victim, the arrest and detention of Ramon Olagoke -Adedoyin and other suspects; the family has been left in the dark and has not been carried along in the progress made so far.</p> <p>The palpable fear being nursed by the family as a consequence of the silence from your end towards the family is further heightened by a series of unfounded and baseless press releases issued by the Hilton Top Hotel lle-Ife trying to cover up their Achilles’ heels and the roles played by the suspects in the murder which are designed and calculated to mislead the curious public and interfere with the whole investigation of the crime.</p> <p>The fear being exhibited by our client was lent more credence when your Command Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, granted an interview on FRESH FM radio Osogbo and she said, “Dr. Adedoyin is still very much in police custody here In Osun”, “if in the course of our investigation, we are required to transfer him to the Force Headquarters in Abuja, we would do so. For now, however, he is still very much in our custody”.</p> <p>We would like to stress that the family’s concern is not out of place, going by the report about Adedoyin who is being touted to be an influential personality. One then begins to wonder what Abuja has to do with this investigation. We believe in your command and we know we can get the best from your end rather than Abuja.</p> <p>While commending the Police for the height attained so far in the discreet investigation of this case, we hereby demand that the family and their counsel be carried along and properly briefed of all developments and feats recorded as the investigation continues so that we would be seized of the facts right from the horse’s mouth for proper advice and guidance of the family who is much distraught and downcast over the loss.</p> <p>It should not be forgotten in a hurry that the victim was a Student of OAU lle-Ife till he was murdered in cold blood. Other students are presently preoccupied with examinations after which they may be out of control if the family and the entire public are not carried along and properly updated on the progress in the case.</p> <p>We vehemently urge the police authorities to expedite action on the case in the interest of justice and ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime against the soul of the victim are in court at the earliest practicable time for the law to take its course. The victim’s soul cries for justice!!!</p> <p>However, counsel to Adedoyin, Mr Williams Abiodun said the family was carried along throughout the preliminary investigation, as a family representative, Olagbade Adegoke was with the police all through.</p> <p>He added that the family seems to be afraid of autopsy because they refuse to make themselves available for the exercise last Friday, despite earlier notice by the police.</p> <p>“The Commissioner of Police has insisted that the autopsy must be done on Monday. Initially, it was supposed to be done last Friday, but the deceased’s family were not available. All the three pathologists were there, the police were there, I was there too.</p> <p>“We waited from 12 to 3 pm and they did not show up.

1003062585,Small Engine Repair: Quick Fix,2021-09-08 00:00:00,"<p>They’re selling Small Engine Repair as the new movie about toxic masculinity. It is that, but I think that’s the wrong way to approach it, should you find yourself taking it in at either the AMC theater at Parks Mall or Movie Tavern Hulen this weekend. The better way to see it is as a stage play that has been effectively translated to film. I wish I saw more movies like this.</p> <p>Playwright John Pollono is the writer-director here, and he portrays Frank Romanowski, who runs a repair shop for lawnmowers and other small motor-powered devices in Manchester, N.H. He’s an ex-convict with a daughter named Crystal (Ciara Bravo), who has been accepted early to UCLA. He’s managed to stay out of prison for her, even though every time he goes out drinking with his buddies Swaino and Packie (Jon Bernthal and Shea Whigham), it ends in a bar fight. One evening, he invites the guys over to his shop for a night of steaks, expensive Scotch, and MMA on pay-per-view. They don’t know that this gathering is a trap for one of Crystal’s high-school friends, a powerful Boston lawyer’s son (Spencer House) and a drug dealer who has slut-shamed her on Instagram after she was unwise enough to sext him naked pictures. Now she’s lying in a coma after a suicide attempt, and Frank wants to spill this kid’s blue blood all over the floor of his garage.</p> <p>Pollono’s script is keen, if you can stomach all the casual racism, sexism, and homophobia flying around. (I went to an all-boys school, so I’m well used to it.) Packie is the butt of much of this as the physically smallest of the three, but when a bartender tries to restrain him during a brawl, he takes a chunk out of the guy’s arm with his teeth. There’s violence in the air every time these guys gather, especially when Swaino badmouths Frank’s ex-wife (Jordana Spiro) — who is a legitimately terrible parent — and dares him to bash in his head. Pollono has a good ear, not just for this, but also for the denigration that comes with male bonding, especially when Packie recalls their shared childhood experience of all being beaten by their dads after the Red Sox’s epic loss in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. It’s a traumatic story, and Packie can’t stop laughing as he tells it.</p> <p>Pollono’s direction isn’t schematic and is only rarely stagy. My quarrel with it is that he makes a rookie mistake with the flashback sequences — it’s usually more dramatic to keep the camera on the actor when he tells about the thing that once happened to him. Just because you can show it doesn’t mean you necessarily should. However, this is a minor flaw and doesn’t impede the flow of the story.</p> <p>Whigham is good as always and the director (who has a recurring role on TV’s This Is Us) fits in well with his more seasoned fellow actors as a man whose anger issues are given the ultimate stress test. Still, it’s Bernthal who walks away with the acting honors here. This short, powerfully built actor has showcased his fighting skills on TV’s The Walking Dead and The Punisher, but the 44-year-old D.C. native has the goods even in roles that don’t require him to fight, like the sensitive English teacher in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, the holdup man in Baby Driver, and Lee Iacocca in Ford v Ferrari. Here he’s reprising a role that he originated on the stage 10 years ago, and he’s somehow reassuring even while playing a character who’s frequently out of control, especially in a climactic scene when he lays out a possible compromise solution that allows everyone to walk away.</p> <p>In the end, Small Engine Repair succeeds by keeping its ambitions in check. Who needs explosions, shootouts, or plot twists galore to make a good thriller? What this movie has is three guys who have another guy tied up, guys with criminal histories that fall well short of the step they’re considering taking. They can’t help but wonder whether they’re doing the right thing. Can they avoid the consequences of letting this rich bastard walk, or the consequences of killing him? It’s enough to hang a play or a film on, when it’s done with this kind of skill.</p>",1

But, of course, this is hardly an ordinary situation.</p> <p>In the month since the violent attack, we’ve heard stories from senators, representatives, Capitol police, and staffers about the fear, panic, and chaos that engulfed the Capitol during the riot that claimed 6 lives and injured nearly 140 Capitol Police officers. As Republicans rush to ignore the failed insurrection and demand to move on with disingenuous calls for “unity,” hundreds of people are still struggling to recover, both physically and emotionally, from the attack.</p> <p>In their passionate letter, the staffers wrote of the attack, “That mob was incited by former President Donald J. Trump and his political allies, some of whom we pass every day in the hallways at work.”</p> <p>They continued,</p> <p>“Many of us attended school in the post-Columbine era and were trained to respond to active shooter situations in our classrooms. As the mob smashed through Capitol Police barricades, broke doors and windows, and charged into the Capitol with body armor and weapons, many of us hid behind chairs and and under desks or barricaded ourselves in offices. Others watched on TV and frantically tried to reach bosses and colleagues as they fled for their lives.”</p> <p>The letter goes on to say, “Our Constitution only works when we believe in it and defend it … Any person who doesn’t share these beliefs has no place representing the American people, now or in the future. The use of violence and lies to overturn an election is not worthy of debate. Either you stand with the republic or against it.”</p> <p>“As congressional employees, we don’t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,” they wrote. “And for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.”</p> <p>The letter organizers reached out to Republican aides to sign, but none did. An anonymous staffer told CNN, “No one should have to experience something like this in their place of work … And I think it’s important to tell this part of the story, because it’s not just members of Congress who come to work at the Capitol every day. And it’s not just staffers who work at the Capitol who were traumatized by what happened. And I think that is a piece of it. The trauma is there; the trauma is very real. And anytime that new pieces of information come out, you know, you’re kind of re-traumatized.”</p> <p>I honestly hope that everyone who was inside the Capitol that day has access to counseling and post-traumatic care. And I hope that all the republican trolls dismissing their pain and trauma never get to hold office again.</p> <p>As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in her Instagram Live, “The reason I say this and the reason I’m getting emotional in this moment is because these folks who tell us to move on, that it’s not a big deal, that we should forget what’s happened, or even telling us to apologize. These are the same tactics of abusers.”</p> <p>(via New York Times, featured image: ALEX EDELMAN/AFP via Getty Images)</p> <p>Want more stories like this?

Andrew M. Cuomo.</p> <p>Oswego County District Attorney Gregory Oakes on Monday said no charges will be filed in connection with allegations by a 55-year-old worker for National Grid. Virginia Limmiatis had accused Cuomo of touching her chest during a public event in Oswego County. She said he traced the logo of her company on her shirt with his finger.</p> <p>""After a thorough review of the available evidence and applicable law, the Oswego County District Attorney’s Office has concluded that there is not a sufficient legal basis to bring criminal charges against former-Governor Andrew Cuomo based upon the allegations of unwanted physical contact made by Virginia Limmiatis,"" Oakes stated.</p> <p>The incident in Oswego County was included in the August report by state Attorney General Letitia James that concluded that had sexually harassed multiple women. Cuomo, who denies sexually harassing any women, resigned soon after.</p> <p>Oakes joins district attorneys in Nassau, Westchester and Albany who declined to prosecute Cuomo based on accusations in their jurisdictions, although all noted that they found the women credible.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration</p> <p>WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - The White House has YouTube, not just Facebook, on its list of social media platforms officials say are responsible for an alarming spread of misinformation about COVID vaccines and are not doing enough to stop it, sources familiar with the administration's thinking said.</p> <p>The criticism comes just a week after President Joe Biden called Facebook and other social media companies ""killers"" for failing to slow the spread of misinformation about vaccines. He has since softened his tone.</p> <p>A senior administration official said one of the key problems is ""inconsistent enforcement.""

""They get to grade their own homework.""</p> <p>Some of the main pieces of vaccine misinformation the Biden administration is fighting include that the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective, false claims that they carry microchips and that they hurt women's fertility, the official said.</p> <p>Social media companies have come under fire recently from Biden, his press secretary, Jen Psaki, and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who have all said the spread of lies about vaccines is making it harder to fight the pandemic and save lives.</p> <p>A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which has also been highlighted by the White House, showed 12 anti-vaccine accounts are spreading nearly two-thirds of anti-vaccine misinformation online. Six of those accounts are still posting on YouTube.</p> <p>""We would like to see more done by everybody"" to limit the spread of inaccurate information from those accounts, the official said.</p> <p>The fight against vaccine misinformation has become a top priority for the Biden administration at a time when the pace of vaccinations has slowed considerably despite the risk posed by the Delta variant, with people in many parts of the country hostile to being vaccinated.</p> <p>The requests to Facebook and YouTube come after the White House reached out to Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google in February about clamping down on COVID misinformation, seeking their help to stop it from going viral, another senior administration official said then.</p> <p>""Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to vaccine misinformation... but Google has a lot to answer for and somehow manages to get away with it always because people forget they own YouTube,"" said Imran Ahmed, CCDH founder and chief executive.</p> <p>YouTube spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said that since March 2020, the company has removed over 900,000 videos containing COVID-19 misinformation and terminated YouTube channels of people identified in the CCDH report. She said the company's policies are based on the content of the video, rather than the speaker.</p> <p>""If any remaining channels mentioned in the report violate our policies, we will take action, including permanent terminations,"" she said.</p> <p>On Monday, YouTube also said it will add more credible health information and as well as tabs for viewers to click on.</p> <p>The senior administration official cited four issues on which the administration has asked Facebook to provide specific data, but the company has been reticent to comply.</p> <p>These include how much vaccine misinformation exists on its platform, who is seeing the inaccurate claims, what the company is doing to reach out to them and how does Facebook know the steps it is taking are working.</p> <p>The official said the answers Facebook has given are not ""good enough.""</p> <p>Facebook spokesman Kevin McAlister said the company has removed over 18 million pieces of COVID-19 misinformation since the start of the pandemic and that its own data shows that for people in the United States using the platform, vaccine hesitancy has declined by 50% since January and vaccine acceptance is high.</p> <p>In a separate blog post last Saturday, Facebook called on the administration to stop ""finger-pointing,"" laying out the steps it had taken to encourage users to get vaccinated.</p> <p>But the administration official said the blog post did not have any metrics of success.</p> <p>The Biden administration's broad concern is that the platforms are ""either lying to us and hiding the ball, or they're not taking it seriously and there isn't a deep analysis of what's going on in their platforms,"" the official said.</p> <p>""That calls any solutions they have into question.""</p> <p>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register</p> <p>Reporting by Nandita Bose; Editing by Chris Sanders and Dan Grebler</p> <p>Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</p>",1

Residents and vehicles of Gaocheng district, a heavily populated “high-risk” region, were further restricted and not allowed to leave the district's borders.</p> <p>“Right now, Hebei faces a serious situation to get the pandemic under control and our responsibilities are heavy,” Ma Xiaowei, director of the National Health Commission, told a meeting with Hebei officials on Tuesday.</p> <p>City officials had previously announced that a full lockdown would begin on Thursday but still allowed people to leave by plane, train, and private cars if they presented a negative nucleic acid test result that was issued within the past 72 hours.</p> <p>The 63 infections announced on Wednesday prompted a top Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention official to warn that infections will likely rise in the coming days.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Beijing announced that if any passenger or their belongings were on the same flight as someone who tested positive for the coronavirus, the traveler must serve an extra seven days of quarantine on top of the 14 days required for all people arriving in the capital, according to the South China Morning Post.</p> <p>Chinese authorities have announced few domestic infections since late March 2020. However, local citizens have reported severe outbreaks in different cities and regions throughout the past year.</p> <p>Some residents told The Epoch Times that they had been locked down at home since Jan. 2.</p> <p>“This disease is spreading very quickly,” said Lin Guo (pseudonym), a villager in Xiaoguozhuang of Gaocheng district. “Many of my fellow villagers felt sick and were diagnosed at hospitals,” he added.</p> <p>China has been heavily criticized for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, from demonstrating a lack of transparency regarding positive infections to imposing overly harsh lockdowns.</p> <p>China’s Communist Party has also repeatedly silenced whistleblowers — doctors and citizens — who sounded the alarm about the virus.</p> <p>In December, Chinese Christian journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years in prison for her coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>At the height of China’s outbreak in February, the 37-year-old citizen journalist and former lawyer had traveled from Shanghai to Wuhan to witness the severity of the virus firsthand. In addition to criticizing the CCP for its response to the virus, Zhan shared widely-circulated videos that showed crowded hospitals, empty streets, and citizens worried about their finances.</p> <p>In her final video, Zhang stated, “The government’s way of managing this city has just been intimidation and threats. This is truly the tragedy of this country.”</p> <p>After several months in detention, she was found guilty by Shanghai Pudong New Area People’s Court of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.”</p> <p>Zhang was the first citizen journalist known to face legal proceedings for her activities. Other citizen journalists who disappeared without explanation included Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.</p> <p>Chen Jiangang, a Chinese human rights lawyer, told The New York Times that the length of Zhang’s sentence showed the CCP’s commitment to preserving its narrative of the outbreak.</p> <p>“Any time the Chinese Communist Party thinks of a case as political, what they use is suppression. Extremely cruel suppression,” said Chen.</p> <p>“What was Zhang Zhan’s crime?” he asked. “She just went to Wuhan, saw some things, talked about them. That’s it.”</p>",1

She joined Daesh upon arrival in the country. She had already been linked to fundamentalist circles in Germany and allegedly posted an online call for aid donations for Syria that in reality went to the terror group.</p> <p>Following her husband's reported killing and her own capture by Kurdish forces, Laura H. claims to have turned away from Daesh ideology.</p> <p>A U.S. aid organization helped bring her to Irbil from the al-Hol prison camp in northeastern Syria, Spiegel reported.</p> <p>Turkey has criticized Western countries for refusing to repatriate their citizens who left to join Daesh in Syria and Iraq and stripping some of them of their citizenship. Although the 1961 New York Convention made it illegal to leave people stateless, several countries including France have not ratified it, and recent cases have triggered prolonged legal battles.</p> <p>Germany had already brought home a handful of orphans, but no adults until Saturday. Austria, Belgium, Britain and France have also repatriated a number of orphaned children, while the United States has repatriated several women and their children. Meanwhile, an Albanian boy taken by his mother to join Daesh in Syria returned to his home in Italy earlier this month. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kosovo have all repatriated dozens of women and children.</p>",1

I'm sorry to send you a message for this reason. But for your peace of mind I want to convey my innocence. I don't want to talk about the incident I suffered. Because my ex-wife doesn't want it. I don't know what the news that made you uneasy, but I think the story should exist for the relief and reconciliation of those who have been injured by others. It is unforgivable for my ex-wife that the Japanese police have done to me. I can't tell you the details because it's related to my ex-wife's life, but I still have a good relationship with my ex-wife and my children...I didn't have any choice. I just wanted her peace.

1019034509,NDIS provider apologises to group home residents after allegations of violence and neglect,2021-12-14 00:00:00,"<p>One of Australia’s largest national disability insurance scheme providers has apologised to the residents of two troubled group homes after allegations of violence, abuse and neglect were aired at an inquiry.</p> <p>The commission also heard on Tuesday that Life Without Barriers charged residents at a Victoria home a substantial proportion of their disability pension for “rent” despite the property being leased on a peppercorn deal of $1 a month.</p> <p>During hearings in the past week, the disability royal commission has heard violence between residents at the Victoria group home run by the provider was so bad it had become “normal”, while there were also allegations of violence, sexual abuse, and neglect at another home in New South Wales.</p> <p>In one case aired at the commission last week, a resident in the NSW home was hospitalised with a bowel condition and “nearly died” after staff allegedly did not follow care protocol. The provider did not report the incident to the NDIS watchdog.</p> <p>In another incident, the commission heard a Life Without Barriers investigation found there was not enough evidence to substantiate claims a support worker pushed a client at the NSW home to the ground, even though the employee admitted doing so.</p> <p>Fronting the royal commission on Tuesday, Claire Robbs, the chief executive of Life Without Barriers, apologised to residents and families on behalf of the company.</p> <p>“The views and experiences of people and their families have highlighted several areas where harm has been caused to people and we acknowledge and offer our deepest regret,” she said.</p> <p>Robbs also apologised to each of the victims individually, using the pseudonyms used by the royal commission.</p> <p>“I do not condone the violence towards Sophie, and I offer Sophie and her family our sincere apology for the harm caused to her, including for the manner in which our investigations into the matter was undertaken,” she said.</p> <p>She also apologised to a woman known by the pseudonym Natalie for alleged “sexual misconduct by a staff member”, which was “completely unacceptable”.</p> <p>The staff member was later charged and found not guilty by a court, the inquiry heard last week.</p> <p>Asked by the chair of the royal commission, Ronald Sackville, if Life Without Barriers had “committed a serious breach of a duty that it owed to Natalie”, Robbs replied “yes”.</p> <p>Robbs also agreed the normal course in such a case would be to offer compensation.</p> <p>Life Without Barriers has not offered Natalie or her family compensation.</p> <p>It was also Natalie who was later hospitalised and, according to evidence from her mother, nearly died, after a bowel obstruction that followed the failure of staff to adhere to care protocols.</p> <p>Under questioning from counsel assisting Patrick Griffin, Robbs conceded the provider only paid $1 a month to lease the Victoria group home, but still charged residents a proportion of their fortnightly pension on “rent”.</p> <p>Robbs suggested the “rent” also covered maintenance and other services, though she could not say if this was pointed out to the residents or families.</p> <p>Griffin put to Robbs that most people would consider “rent” to refer to money paid to a landlord for the right to live in a property.</p> <p>“I think if someone asked me that question I would think that the rent also covered the maintenance that would be required to be done to the premises, that would be something I would expect that would be part of the rental payment,” she said.</p> <p>The inquiry has previously heard Sophie, who lives with cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability, was sexually assaulted by a date in a public park.</p> <p>Sophie last week told the royal commission they met in a park because Life Without Barriers banned her from having guests in the house after 6pm.</p> <p>Hobbs was asked why such a serious incident was not reported to the Life Without Barriers board.</p> <p>She responded it was because the incident did not occur “while Sophie was in our care”.</p> <p>“I’m troubled by your answer,” Griffin said, noting the “imposition of those rules in effect made [Life Without Barriers] in part responsible for what subsequently happened”.</p> <p>That was “because Sophie was denied the opportunity to have someone in her home, and consequently was put in a more vulnerable position”.</p> <p>Under questioning, Robbs agreed that was the case, but maintained it was proper not to report the incident to the board.</p> <p>The inquiry continues.</p>",1

960509215,UN war crimes prosecutor blasts South Africa for allowi...,2020-12-19 00:00:00,"<p>The South African government has received a blistering public rebuke from an international war crimes prosecutor for allowing one of the worst perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide to escape from South Africa in 2018 and for continuing to frustrate international efforts to track him down.</p> <p>Serge Brammertz, Prosecutor of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT), told the UN Security Council in New York on Monday 14 December that South African authorities had refused even to place Fulgence Kayishema, a fugitive from the tribunal, under provisional arrest, when tribunal investigators traced him to Cape Town two years ago. This was despite an international United Nations warrant for his arrest which all UN members were obliged to implement. Nor had Pretoria even placed him under surveillance. As a result, he escaped from South Africa a year ago and has yet not been found.</p> <p>The IRMCT was created in 2010 to take over and complete outstanding cases from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) – and the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) – as their mandates were expiring.</p> <p>The prosecutor’s unusually blunt report to the UN Security Council about South Africa’s unhelpful attitude has been described by one diplomatic source as “an astonishing indictment of a country which prides itself on upholding international justice”.</p> <p>Brammertz said in his annual report to the Security Council that Kayishema “remains at large following South Africa’s failure to provide effective cooperation over the last two and a half years”. Pretoria’s failures included refusing to arrest Kayishema on grounds that he had been given refugee status. But later the Department of Home Affairs claimed that it had lost his refugee file and his fingerprints which the tribunal needed to confirm his identity.</p> <p>“My Office alleges that Kayishema, the local police inspector, played an important role in the 16 April 1994 massacre at Nyange Church,” Brammertz said.</p> <p>“In the days leading up to the massacre, 2,000 Tutsi civilians – women, men, children and elderly – sought refuge in the church.</p> <p>“Initially, militias surrounded the church and launched an attack, including throwing hand grenades into the packed building. While many were wounded and killed, the refugees resisted, forcing the attackers to retreat.</p> <p>“Determined to murder these innocent civilians, local leaders, including Kayishema, brought a bulldozer to the church grounds. In an act of unimaginable brutality and sacrilege, the bulldozer was used to demolish the church with the refugees still inside. More than 1,500 were crushed to death. Survivors who escaped were hunted down and killed. Kayishema fled from justice, and remained a fugitive for years. “</p> <p>“But almost three years ago, my Office finally located him. Relying on records and sources, my Office concluded in early 2018 that Kayishema was living in Cape Town, South Africa. This was confirmed by South African authorities via INTERPOL in August 2018. We immediately submitted an urgent request for assistance to South Africa seeking his prompt arrest.</p> <p>“So we were surprised to be informed that because Kayishema had been granted refugee status in South Africa, he could not be handed over to the Mechanism. This excuse was withdrawn months later, replaced with a new argument that South Africa lacked a legal basis to cooperate with the Mechanism.</p> <p>“After sixteen months of intense negotiations, in December 2019, South Africa finally submitted the UN arrest warrant for execution, which a local magistrate approved. However, by then, Kayishema could no longer be found. It is important to note that my Office has reliable information that Kayishema was present in South Africa as late as October and November 2019, so merely weeks before South Africa reported in the Security Council that the arrest operation was unsuccessful.</p> <p>”Little has improved since. A year ago, after the failed arrest, my Office submitted an extensive request for assistance detailing information we required to continue the pursuit of Kayishema. Yet our request still has not been satisfactorily answered.</p> <p>“Two months ago in October, it was agreed that my Office would send a technical team to Pretoria to finally receive the requested material. The foreign affairs and justice ministries convened a number of joint meetings with responsible officials.</p> <p>“But the Department of Home Affairs, which has responsibility for key information, did not attend as scheduled. My Office was then again requested to send last week another mission to specifically meet with the Department of Home Affairs and receive outstanding documents. To our great surprise, on the last day of the mission, Home Affairs representatives informed us that Kayishema’s refugee file and fingerprints do not exist. This is difficult to understand. “</p> <p>Brammertz told the UN Security Council that he was reporting these facts “ to explain why, despite all my Office’s efforts, Kayishema remains at large.</p> <p>“The situation raises many questions. How can it be that South Africa refused to arrest Kayishema two and a half years ago based on a refugee file that it is now claimed doesn’t exist? And why didn’t authorities take obvious measures after being informed that an internationally wanted fugitive indicted for genocide was present in their country?</p> <p>“Despite a UN warrant calling for Kayishema’s immediate arrest, South African authorities did not provisionally detain him or put him under any surveillance to prevent his escape.”</p> <p>Brammertz added that it was now most important was to move forward and finally arrest Kayishema. He appealed directly to South Africa’s representative in the Security Council – where South Africa has been serving as a temporary member for the last two years – to finally help his tribunal find Kayishema.</p> <p>“Empower your operational services – particularly police and prosecutors – to work directly with us on a day-to-day basis. And truly give them your full political and diplomatic support, as well as the resources they require to help us. I am prepared to visit Pretoria in the new year to discuss our further cooperation and agree on a clear joint strategy and operational arrangements. This would also send the right message to other capitals”.</p> <p>Daily Maverick asked both the Department of International Relations and Cooperation and the Department of Justice and Correction Services for comment but after several hours neither had responded.</p> <p>Darren Bergman, the spokesperson for international relations and cooperation of the Democratic Alliance said:</p> <p>“Unfortunately the Government of South Africa believes in loyalty before the Constitution. When it comes to international relations and cooperation the name has been misleading for years as we have been anything but cooperative to the likes of world organizations that we pay hefty membership fees to sit on.</p> <p>“We continue to embarrass ourselves and show that certain individuals’ lives matter more than mass lives in hypocritical ways that leave the international community continuously confused and frustrated at us. This has an impact on tourism, foreign investment and long term relationships.”</p> <p>According to the website of Brammerz’s tribunal, of the 90 persons originally indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTR) on Rwanda, six remain at large. Of these, Protais Mpiranya has been earmarked for trial by the Mechanism. The ICTR Prosecutor has requested referrals to Rwanda for trial in the cases of the five other fugitives: Kayishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, Ryandikayo (first name unknown) and Phénéas Munyarugarama.</p> <p>At the start of 2020 there were two more fugitives at large. But in May 2020, DNA tests established that one of the most wanted killers, Augustin Bizimana, the defence minister at the time of the genocide and one of the kingpins of the extermination of Tutsis, had died in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo, in 2000.</p> <p>And Félicien Kabuga was arrested in France on 16 May 2020, “following an intensive analysis of telecommunications and other data… thanks to efficient cooperation from French authorities,” Brammertz told the UN Security Council last week. He added that the tribunal was progressing with preparations for Kabuga’s trial and he had already appeared in court at The Hague on 11 November this year.</p> <p>The UN has offered up to US$5 million as a reward for information leading to the arrests of any of the remaining fugitives.</p> <p>Brammertz was also critical of the Zimbabwean and Ugandan governments for their failures to cooperate fully with his tribunal in pursuing fugitives, though he did not identify which one or ones.</p> <p>Brammertz said he intended to travel soon to Harare for further discussions with the government there:</p> <p>“To move cooperation in the right direction, we would expect to see a more pro-active approach by the Zimbabwean Task Force.</p> <p>“In this regard, effective investigations would need to begin with the acknowledgment that a fugitive is known to have sheltered in Zimbabwe and has deep, long-standing connections with Zimbabwean persons.</p> <p>“Similarly, my team and I will need to return again to Kampala to engage in open and frank discussions about the urgent steps needed to remedy long-standing issues. Authorities have acknowledged that a fugitive obtained an official Ugandan passport, but our requests for investigation records and access to persons of interest have not been answered after more than a year.” DM</p>",1

The terror suspect is in custody.</p> <p>A joint investigation by the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police found that the terrorist, Wasim Assayed, 34, of Hebron, stabbed Yehuda and Tamar Kaduri to death in their Jerusalem home on Jan. 13, 2019, in the Armon Hanatziv neighborhood.</p> <p>A day before the stabbing, an Israeli teenager was also stabbed in the same area.</p> <p>In March, the terrorist stabbed a Moldovan worker in Israel, Ivan Tarnovski, to death and injured a second Moldovan national. As the Jerusalem District Police’s Central Unit investigated the March stabbings, Assayed was arrested by Border Police in northern Jerusalem after entering Israel illegally, as he tried to cross the seamline security fence. Police recovered a knife from his possession.</p> <p>The Shin Bet questioned the suspect due to his affiliation with ISIS, and suspicions soon arose that he was plotting an attack.</p> <p>Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate</p> <p>by email and never miss</p> <p>our top stories</p> <p>Four days prior to his arrest in late March, Assayed was released from administrative detention, where he had been for more than two years due to his involvement in terror activities that are not related to the murders.</p> <p>During a Shin Bet-Israel Police investigation, Assayed’s involvement with the stabbings of the Moldovan nationals arose, and evidence linking the terrorist to the attack was found, police said in a statement.</p> <p>“During additional investigative steps that occurred by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem District’s Central Unit, it emerged that in January 2019, Assayed murdered Tamar and Yehuda Kaduri by stabbing them in their home in Jerusalem,” police stated. “It also emerged that a day beforehand, Assayed attempted to stab a teenager in the same area, leading to her being injured.”</p> <p>A terrorist motivation was established for all incidents during the investigation.</p> <p>Assayed also served prison time between 2015 and 2018 due to his involvement with ISIS activities and plans to commit attacks against Israelis. After being released by Israel, he was arrested by the Palestinian Authority for months.</p> <p>In January 2019, after being released by the P.A. and committing the Jerusalem murders, he was rearrested by Israel; tried for incitement and membership in a hostile organization; and again jailed.

994514305,The R.I.P. mirage,2021-07-12 03:53:31+01:00,"<p>Editorial</p> <p>Newspaper reports about five persons arrested in Ondo State for being allegedly in possession of human body parts might be shocking but definitely not new. This is because stories of human body part sales and ritual killings in Nigeria dates back to generations amongst all tribes. This is rooted in the African supernatural beliefs. Some herbalists and some people in all the religions believe in the fairy tale efficacy of the said items.</p> <p>This warped belief that human body parts of either dead and buried people or murdered humans, especially women, children, the mentally challenged, the disabled and the elderly is the reason there are stories of invasion of cemeteries and various accounts of ritual murders across the country.</p> <p>The erroneous belief that fetish use of human parts can enhance riches, elongate life, assist those involved to access political power is reason there are increased cases of missing persons who are often kidnapped by head-hunters who operate as syndicates in various communities in the country. Most of those often arrested by the police, in confessional statements disclose their modus operandi and the names and status of their syndicates and clients.</p> <p>The worrisome part of human body parts sales is that the narrative about its efficacy in letting those involved achieve their dubious objectives has no scientific validation. The economic crisis has increased the economic pressure on cititizens with more irresponsible and sadistic individuals and groups indulging in the business of killing other humans to improve their own lot.</p> <p>The more frightening dimension of the belief in the assumed efficacy of the rituals is that the perpetrators are so narcissistic they even use their biological relatives like mothers, children, and other close relatives as the witch doctors often make them believe that the closer they are to victims, the more efficacious the rituals.</p> <p>The mystery surrounding people’s involvement in rituals with human parts is that it defies tribe, social status and religion. The irony of a country that is seemingly the most religious in the world with more churches, mosques and shrines than industries, but with the most cases of ritual killings and cemetery invasions given the population and statistics, is the hypocrisy of the situation. All the religions practiced in the country all tend to admonish adherents about love and sanctity of the human life but sadly, actions speak louder.</p> <p>We find it contradictory that most of those involved in ritual killings and sale of human parts appear religious without the piety that makes them positively functional beings. We feel that while humans have the freedom to choose, there are certain ways that religion can help if well-channelled, to control the erroneous belief in the assumed magical powers of human parts for ritual purposes.</p> <p>We equally believe that given the recent upsurge in reports of kidnappings and missing persons, the various tiers of government must begin to address the cases of insecurity with more serious attention on the hideouts of these criminals because they do not operate from a vacuum. The travelling routes and forests can be better secured to keep kidnappers out of business because no one commits such crimes in the open.</p> <p>The invasion of cemeteries for body parts may not be a new phenomenon. But again, it is against the African culture to interfere with corpses as it is seen as having grave spiritual implications for those involved. Cemeteries are in well-designated places around the country and should be better secured by the authorities. Beyond the indignities of violating the dead, most dead people died of various contagious diseases like COVID-19 that can be dire for the living.</p> <p>Beyond cemeteries, it is the same ritual intents that are fuelling the kidnappings around the country that is almost at epidemic level. Something urgent must be done by governments to protect the people and re-orientate them in ways to cub this social menace that comes with huge socio-economic implications. The world has moved beyond vague superstitious beliefs that enhance poverty rather than development. The human beings being killed are productive citizens that can make changes in the life of a nation. The dead in the cemeteries are supposed to be allowed to rest in peace as is the belief in all human creeds.</p>",1

Herbert Oliver, a civil rights activist who documented police brutality against African Americans in Alabama in the early 1960s and later fought for public school reform in New York City, has died. He was 96.</p> <p>Oliver died Nov. 30 in New York City after struggling with several health problems, his daughter, Patrice Oliver, said at his funeral in Brooklyn on Wednesday, according to an online video of the service. Oliver’s relatives could not be reached Saturday.</p> <p>Oliver was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on Feb. 28, 1925.</p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> <p>From 1960 to 1965, he was the executive secretary of the Inter-Citizens Committee in Birmingham and worked with other clergy members to fight discriminatory policing led by Public Safety Commissioner T. Eugene “Bull” Connor, according to a profile of Oliver published in 2018 by his alma mater, Wheaton College, near Chicago.</p> <p>The committee documented more than 100 cases of alleged brutality and civil rights violations by Birmingham police.</p> <p>“I would keep my eyes on the newspapers, and the newspaper would carry stories about people who had been beaten and arrested by policemen,” Oliver told the Wheaton Magazine. “I would find the victim and ask them to tell us their story. Invariably, the stories the victims would tell us were different from the stories the newspaper would put out.”</p> <p>By 1965, police brutality cases had dropped off and Oliver moved to Brooklyn, where he was pastor of the Westminster Bethany Presbyterian Church from 1967 to 1992.</p> <p>Oliver led a new local school board in Brooklyn in the predominantly Black area Ocean Hill-Brownsville from 1967 until it was disbanded in 1970 amid controversy. The board’s transfer of teachers, many of them white and Jewish, out of the school district led to a citywide, 36-day teachers’ strike in 1968, and eventually the board’s disbanding, The New York Times reported.</p> <p>“There was a lack of good education, and the teachers and principals were not from the community or invested in the students,” Oliver told the Wheaton Magazine. “We were trying to settle the unrest of the community-centered in schools.”</p>",1

1041315997,"Kidnapped California baby found, 3 suspects detained",2022-04-26 03:31:54,"<p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A 3-month-old baby who was kidnapped from his San Francisco Bay Area home was found Tuesday and three suspects were detained, police said.</p> <p>The baby, Brandon Cuellar, was unharmed but was taken to a hospital as a precaution, San Jose Police Department officials said during a news conference.</p> <p>“This incident is a parents’ worst nightmare. We are fortunate it resulted in a positive outcome,” San Jose Police Chief Anthony Mata said, declining to release details on where the baby was found or the identities of the three people who were detained.</p> <p>The child was taken Monday from his apartment in San Jose by a man who was seen on video walking away with the baby in a carrier.</p> <p>Police believe they have apprehended the man in the video, who was one of the three taken into custody, said San Jose Assistant Police Chief Paul Joseph.</p> <p>Also detained was a woman who was with the child’s grandmother before the abduction, San Jose Police spokesman Sgt. Christian Camarillo told reporters.</p> <p>“This was a person who was with the grandmother yesterday when they went shopping, she was present at the apartment complex when this happened,” he said. “There have been some inconsistencies with what she has told us.

945398681,"Rochester, New York, police chief resigns in wake of Daniel Prude's death",2020-09-08 19:29:58,"<p>(Reuters) - Rochester, New York’s police chief abruptly resigned on Tuesday along with his command staff, saying there had been a “mischaracterization and politicization” of his actions following the death of Daniel Prude in police custody.</p> <p>Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren told a City Council meeting that she had not asked Chief La’Ron Singletary to resign, though she said there was “information that was brought to light today that I have not previously seen before.” She did not elaborate.</p> <p>Rochester, a city of 200,000 people on Lake Ontario, erupted with protests last week after the Prude family released body camera footage showing officers had used a mesh hood and pinned Prude, a 41-year-old Black man, to the pavement during the March arrest.</p> <p>The release of the footage five months after Prude’s death had raised questions of a possible cover-up and turned Rochester into the latest flashpoint in a summer of protests over racial injustice first sparked by George Floyd’s May 25 death.</p> <p>Seven police officers involved in the arrest were suspended last week. The medical examiner ruled Prude’s death a homicide by asphyxiation, with the drug PCP a contributing factor. He was having a psychotic episode when he was arrested.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter activists had called for Singletary’s resignation. But as recently as Sunday, amid a weekend of demonstrations, he had said he intended to stay on, and Warren backed him. Both he and the mayor are Black.</p> <p>“As a man of integrity, I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character,” Singletary said in a statement, noting his 20 years on the force.</p> <p>“The mischaracterization and the politicization of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr. Prude’s death is not based on facts, and is not what I stand for.”</p> <p>Warren, who has also come under pressure for the handling of Prude’s arrest and death, said Singletary’s deputy, Joseph Morabito, had also retired and that “there may be a number of others that will decide to leave as well.”</p> <p>The mayor said she was unsure when the retirements would take effect.</p> <p>Free the People ROC, a local Black Lives Matter group, welcomed the resignations in a Facebook post but demanded more.</p> <p>“Let’s keep the pressure up until all those responsible for Daniel Prude’s murder and cover up — including Mayor Lovely Warren - have resigned, taken responsibility and donated their pensions to the families they allowed to be harmed,” it wrote.</p> <p>Separately on Tuesday, Dallas police department chief Reneé Hall also agreed to resign after a backlash against her department’s handling of demonstrations against racism and police brutality. Hall, who wrote her resignation letter on Tuesday, will stay on until the end of the year.</p> <p>Last month, some Dallas City Council members said they had lost trust in Hall’s leadership citing lack of transparency regarding the force that police used that injured some demonstrators.</p> <p>Warren apologized to the Prude family last week and suggested she had been misled by Singletary - an allegation he denied. Singletary also pointed to his ordering of an internal investigation soon after the incident.</p> <p>The Rochester police union’s head, Michael Mazzeo, defended the officers last week, saying they followed procedure in using the so-called “spit hood,” necessary because Prude claimed he had the coronavirus. Mazzeo also said Singletary’s office told him after the arrest there were “no concerns” with the officers’ actions.</p>",1
915602241,Houthi-led Yemeni government releases Baha’i prisoners overturning previous court verdict,2020-03-28 13:52:08+02:00,"<p>Iranian-backed Houthi rebels that control the Yemeni capital of Sana’a have ordered the release of six Baha’i prisoners, including Hamid bin Haiydara, the leader of the Baha’i minority in Yemen. The President of the Supreme Political Council, Mahdi Al-Mashat made the announcement on March 25.</p> <p>The announcement came after an appeals court in Sana’a upheld Haydara’s death sentence three days before, which was first handed down in January 2018.</p> <p>In a statement, the Baha’i International Community (BIC) welcomed the announcement but said that they want it implemented immediately. The BIC previously described their imprisonment as “religiously motivated,” and driven by “baseless charges.”</p> <p>“Like all other Yemeni citizens, Baha’is should be permitted to practice their faith freely, in keeping with the universal principles of freedom of religion or belief. The Baha’is of Yemen have and will continue to contribute to the life of their country and their fellow citizens,” the BIC stated.</p> <p>The community also called on the National Salvation Government to drop charges against 20 other faith believers who were charged in 2018 and return assets belonging to that community that were confiscated by Yemeni authorities.</p> <p>Haydara’s trial lasted five years after he was found guilty by a Houthi court of spying for Israel, a decision that Amnesty International said was unfair and biased.</p> <p>“This decision, taken in Hamid Haydara’s absence, is only the latest development in what has been a flagrantly-flawed trial and indicates the lengths to which the Houthis are willing to go to consolidate their control,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.</p> <p>Earlier, the United States and other countries publicly expressed their concerns about the treatment of the Baha’i community by the Houthis.</p> <p>Amnesty International has documented the cases of 66 individuals, the vast majority of which are men, who were brought before the Sana’a-based Specialised Criminal Court, a Houthi creation, between 2015 and 2020.</p> <p>The Baha’i community has been living in Yemen for over 150 years. The faith first emerged from Iran in 1844 but is currently prohibited by the modern Islamic Republic. Baha’i followers are systematically persecuted by the Iranian state and their proxies in the wider Middle East. There are an estimated six million Baha’i followers worldwide, with the highest concentration of followers and Baha’i holy sites currently located in Israel.</p>",1
885053861,Pedro X. Molina uses cartoons to comment on the political and social realities of Nicaragua,2019-11-07 14:34:43,"<p>The husband and wife team that sits as President and Vice President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo, are frequent subjects of cartoonist Pedro X. Molina’s pen.</p> <p>Cartoonist Pedro X. Molina speaks during an event on media and democracy at UT Austin on Nov. 1. (Teresa Mioli/Knight Center)</p> <p>His illustrations contain references to their similarities with past dictators, to their spending extravagances, to their attacks on independent media outlets, and of course, to their roles in the deaths of nearly 400 people who were killed in the context of protests that began in April 2018.</p> <p>With the help of these cartoons, Molina told students, faculty and members of the public gathered at the University of Texas at Austin on Nov. 1 about the current political crisis Nicaragua is experiencing and how critical media have become targets in the process. It was part of the event, “Media and Democracy in Times of Digital Cholera and Polarization in Latin America,” hosted by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas and LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections.</p> <p>The position the country is in now did not start on April 2018, as Molina explains it.</p> <p>“For more than a decade, we have experienced a continuous erosion of all our fundamental civil and human rights in Nicaragua, including electoral fraud, a corrupt justice system, a criminal Congress and an executive power whose only function is to remain in power no matter what,” Molina said. “Electoral fraud, repression, corruption, abuse and killings have been rising steadily for a decade. It’s not something that just exploded last year.”</p> <p>Yet, demonstrations took hold in the country following a proposed reform to the social security law more than one year ago.</p> <p>One of those killed during the protests was Angel Gahona, a journalist killed with a single bullet to the head while broadcasting on Facebook Live.</p> <p>As things got worse for the general public, so did the situation for independent journalists.</p> <p>“Journalists were harassed, beaten, and robbed in the streets by the forces of the regime,” Molina said. “Radio stations were burned and newspapers started having problems printing their daily editions because the government wouldn’t let them import the paper and ink they needed. The most visible journalists received threats of jail and death through social media.”</p> <p>In December 2018, police forces raided the newsroom of digital site Confidencial, which publishes Molina’s work, and took computers, cameras, etc.</p> <p>“The next day, the journalists found themselves borrowing computers so that they could denounce the aggression,” Molina said. “Since we were still producing content for the people, Ortega and Murillo weren’t happy. Somehow they were thinking that by taking away our equipment, we will stop reporting what was happening. But we didn’t, of course. Things no longer work like in the 70s.”</p> <p>The police came back the next day, occupied the building and are still there today.</p> <p>A week later, the police forces raided independent TV station 100% Noticias and arrested the owner of the station and news director, charging them with promotion of terrorism, as Molina explained.</p> <p>“By that time, it was pretty obvious that the government was hunting down independent journalists. The level of the threats many of us were getting went up. Now they were not only threatening us with jail or death, but they were also starting to mention details about our private lives and our families.”</p> <p>About 60 independent journalists have had to leave the country, many of them continuing to work outside the country.</p> <p>To do the critical work he does, Molina found a home at digital site Confidencial. This happened prior to the April 2018 protests.</p> <p>“I am able to keep doing this because I found myself a spot in a strong, determined group of people with whom I can do this kind of thing. It’s very important for us to get together and try to find ourselves with other people who are thinking alike and really, really trying to make a difference.”</p> <p>As Molina explained, he joined the site after leaving print newspaper El Nuevo Diario following its sale to people who did not want to attract the ire of the government and who therefore asked him to not draw about it.</p> <p>Cartoonist Pedro X. Molina and radio producer Joy Díaz discuss media in Nicaragua. (Teresa Mioli/Knight Center)</p> <p>“People ask me if things are cooling down in Nicaragua right now,” Molina said. “My answer is that things are even worse now.”</p> <p>Protesters cannot go out into the street, killings are still happening and political prisoners are harassed. As far as the independent press, El Nuevo Diario had to close because of a lack of printing materials. Print newspaper La Prensa was forced to change its format and reduce page count. Additionally, independent journalists are still being physically attacked.</p> <p>“Everyday, things get worse in Nicaragua while the world seems to forget a little more about it,” he said.</p> <p>Joy Díaz, producer of the radio show Texas Standard and moderator of a talk with Molina, pointed out similarities between Nicaragua and the U.S. and asked how the latter country might learn from the former.</p> <p>“By trying to care about what is happening down there. People over here, I have a feeling that they just care about ‘this will cause more people to get into the States’ and that’s it,” Molina said.</p> <p>“They don’t care about anything else. They don’t care about why these people are leaving their countries and trying to come here. And they are only focused on trying to stop those people.”</p> <p>Díaz also asked Molina what he would like to be remembered for.</p> <p>“I don’t care about people remembering me. What I do want people to remember is maybe my work or the reason I do my work,” Molina said. “This idea of being free, of being able to say whatever you want about the society in which you live, and don’t take anything for granted. To be very skeptical and very critical of everything we see and care about each other and care about politics.”</p>",1
958564668,Two Filipinos awaiting execution in U.S.,2020-12-08 19:16:17,"<p>Two Filipinos out of a total of 124 foreign nationals are currently on death row awaiting execution, according to data from the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center.</p> <p>The DPIC website shows the biggest number of foreigners who have been sentenced to capital punishment as coming from Mexico with 50 individuals, followed by Cuba and Vietnam with 8 incarcerated nationals each. The rest are nationals from a variety of countries, each with anywhere from 1 to 5 inmates. Countries in the ASEAN region count 4 from Cambodia, 2 each from Laos and the Philippines. The latest data, provided by Mark Warren of Human Rights Research, is dated Sept. 23, 2020.</p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> <p>The Filipinos meted the death penalty were identified on the DPIC website as Sonny Enraca of California and Ralph Simon Jeremias of Nevada. In Nevada, only 5 foreigners are on Death Row and Jeremias is one of them. California has 60 foreigners awaiting capital punishment.</p> <p>News reports state that Sonny Enraca was sentenced to death in Riverside County on July 23, 1999 for the fatal shooting of an actor who had appeared in the “Boyz N the Hood” movie.</p> <p>As reported in mycrimelibrary.com: “Enraca, a Philippine national who had lived in the United States for eight years, was a member of the Akrho Boyz Crazzy (sic) (ABC) gang, an affiliate of the Bloods. Enraca initially denied any involvement in the shootings but confessed soon after he was arrested.”</p> <p>According to the Las Vegas Review Journal, a second Filipino, Ralph Simon Jeremias, was sentenced for the “execution-style” shootings of Paul Stephens and Brian Hudson in 2009. Jeremias said the victims were already dead when he came to the apartment complex to buy marijuana. Two of his friends disputed this account and said Jeremias entered the building alone and shot the two men multiple times, according to the news report.</p> <p>As stated on the website, a “foreign national” is an individual who does not possess U.S. citizenship. They would generally include “tourists and visitors, migrant workers with temporary permits, resident aliens, undocumented aliens, asylum-seekers, and persons in transit.”</p> <p>The data provided may not be accurate because of the difficulty of ascertaining the nationality of death sentence persons, and the criteria for determining nationality vary from state to state.</p> <p>“Compounding the problem is the still-widespread failure of U.S. law enforcement officials to notify detained foreigners of their consular rights. Without this notification and subsequent communication at the request of the detained national, foreign consulates in the United States are likely to remain unaware of the true number of their nationals who are imprisoned, let alone sentenced to death,” states the website.</p> <p>Support for capital punishment is waning because of several cases of mistaken convictions and a disproportionately high number of Black suspects in incarceration. This has led to several states abolishing the death penalty.</p> <p>Americans surveyed by DPIC have said that life in prison without parole is a “better approach for punishing murder than the death penalty.” @The FilAm</p> <p>Subscribe to our newsletters!

Gabriel Suswam (Benue East) has suggested that some leaders and politicians should be allowed to spend a day or two in prison to be better leaders and politicians.</p> <p>Suswam made this suggestion on Tuesday at the plenary while contributing to a motion moved by Sen. Uche Ekwunife (Anambra Central) on `The need to upgrade, decongest and disinfect Correctional Centres nationwide.`</p> <p>“I want to strongly support this motion based on my personal experience of what I saw, and when I left, I recommended that for people to be proper leaders in this country, at least each and every one of us must spend one or two days in prison, we would be better human beings.</p> <p>“Mr President, they took me there in the night, and the following day, which was morning the entire prison knew that I was there.</p> <p>“Mr President it might interest you to know that most of the people who spend years in prison are for a misdemeanour that you can even dismiss.</p> <p>“A young man spent 7years in jail for just a problem of N10, 000, various individuals were there on very minor offences that the police could afford to correct them and send them home.</p> <p>“I made it a point of duty when I left that place, for the next month, I took close to twenty of those young people out of that place.</p> <p>“It didn’t take anything, it was just to pay that money and take them back to court.</p> <p>“I selected about three lawyers, sent them to Kuje prison to go and attend to them, and about 20 of them were taken out.</p> <p>“So, I think that I want to support the motion, because most of the people who are there do not need to be there, and they unduly congest the place.</p> <p>Suswam decried the poor state of hygiene in the correctional Centres, pointing out that they are breeding grounds for various forms of unthinkable diseases and crimes.</p> <p>According to him, when it comes to the issue of disinfecting the place, Mr President, God forbid that this COVID-19 infects any of these correctional centres in the country, Mr President it would be a calamity.</p> <p>“The environment in any of the prisons here, Mr President you would be shocked if you go there; we need to as a matter of urgency ask the authorities responsible to address the issue raised in this motion with the urgency it deserves.</p> <p>“So, we can be seen as a country ready to correct people rather than sending people to go and die or become more hardened,“he said</p> <p>The former governor pointed out that in some parts of the world wealthy individuals and companies build correctional centres and work in collaboration with the government.</p> <p>He said “in developed climes, individuals or companies build prisons and maintain them to the highest standards and government takes care of what is needed to be taken care of.</p> <p>“So, let us encourage individuals who are wealthy or companies that want to engage in that business to begin to build prisons, and maintain them and give them standards, so, we will not have the situation of congestion.“</p> <p>News Agency of Nigeria reports that Sen.

985154477,‘I was so scared’: Miss Universe Myanmar arrives for pageant with a message,2021-05-16 00:00:00,"<p>“The soldiers patrol the city every day, and sometimes they set up roadblocks to harass the people coming through,” said Thuzar Wint Lwin, who also goes by the name Candy. “In some cases, they fire without hesitation. We are scared of our own soldiers. Whenever we see one, all we feel is anger and fear.” Every evening on television, the military announces new arrest warrants for celebrities and others who have been critical of the regime. Some of those named have been people Thuzar Wint Lwin knows. Thuzar Wint Lwin doesn’t expect to be able to return to Myanmar following her criticism of the junta. Credit:Ysa Pérez/The New York Times Before leaving for the United States, she watched anxiously to see if her name had ended up on the military’s wanted list. She saw reports of well-known people being detained as they tried to leave the country, so she decided to wear a hoodie and glasses to keep from being recognised at the Yangon airport. “I had to pass through immigration, and I was so scared,” she said in an interview from Florida. In criticising the junta from outside her country, Miss Universe Myanmar is not alone.</p> <p>Win Htet Oo, one of the country’s best swimmers, said from Australia that he was giving up his dream of going to the Olympics and would not compete under the Myanmar flag until the regime’s leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, was removed from power. And mixed martial arts fighter Aung La Nsang, an American citizen and one of Myanmar’s most famous athletes, has urged President Joe Biden to help end the suffering of Myanmar’s people. Loading Thuzar Wint Lwin said she believes that it will not be safe for her to return to Myanmar after speaking out against the regime; she does not know where she will go after the pageant ends. An English major at East Yangon University, her path to the pro-democracy movement can perhaps be traced back to her childhood. She grew up in a middle-class household. Like many parents, her father, a businessman, and her mother, a housewife, dared not discuss the military government that was then in power. One of her early memories was walking with her mother near Sule Pagoda in downtown Yangon in 2007, when monks led nationwide protests against military rule. She was 7. As they neared the pagoda, soldiers broke up the protest by shooting their guns in the air. People started running. She and her mother ran, too.</p> <p>“We were very scared,” she recalled. “We went to a stranger’s house, and we were hiding.” Soon after, the military crushed that protest movement by shooting dozens of people. But by 2011, the military began sharing power with civilian leaders and opening the country, allowing cellphones and affordable internet access to flood in. Thuzar Wint Lwin is part of the first generation in Myanmar to grow up fully connected to the outside world and for whom a free society seemed normal. In 2015, the country seated democratically elected officials for the first time in more than a half-century. “We have been living in freedom for five years,” she said. “Do not take us back. We know all about the world. We have the internet.” November was the first time she was old enough to vote, and she cast her ballot for the National League for Democracy, the party of Suu Kyi, which won in a landslide, only to have the military overturn the results by seizing power. Before the coup, Thuzar Wint Lwin’s biggest ordeal came when she was 19 and had surgery to remove precancerous tumours from each breast, leaving permanent scars. She decided against having laser treatment to improve their appearance as a reminder of her success in preventing cancer.</p> <p>“It’s just a scar and I’m still me,” she wrote in a recent post with photographs of the scars. “I met self-acceptance realising nothing changed who I am and the values I set for myself. Now, when I see those scars, I feel empowered.” Loading She began modelling when she was in high school and, after her father’s retirement, helped support the family. She is one of fewer than a dozen contestants from Myanmar ever to compete in the Miss Universe pageant, which was founded in 1952. During the period from 1962 to 2011, when the Tatmadaw first ruled, Myanmar sent no contestants. When Thuzar Wint Lwin arrived in Florida on May 7, she was told the suitcase with her outfits for the competition had been lost by the airline. Most contestants had already arrived and were busy rehearsing, making videos and having photo shoots. As the week wore on, the bag still had not arrived, but the pageant organisers were helping her with her gown, and other contestants were lending her outfits. Her national costume was among the missing items. People from Myanmar who live in the United States provided her with a stunning replacement of ethnic Chin origin. She wore it Thursday to the applause of many in the crowd.</p>",1

Police charged Jarratt in 2017 over the allegations but he was found not guilty, the Guardian reported previously. About a month after he filed his original lawsuit, he dropped it, as iMediaEthics has written.</p> <p>Now, Jarratt is suing the news outlet again, but he is suing in a different court. His previous lawsuit was in NSW supreme court but now he is suing in federal court. Why does that matter?</p> <p>The Guardian explains that the federal court is “a jurisdiction that has several advantages to plaintiffs including speed and the lack of a jury.” While Jarratt has hired a different attorney for this lawsuit, his lawyer for the first defamation lawsuit, Bruce McClintock, said the reason was likely for speed and because “he was defamed a second time” with another news outlet.</p> <p>iMediaEthics has written to Jarratt’s lawyer, Bill Kalantzis, and the Telegraph‘s publisher News Corp Australia.</p>",1
975175738,Nergal: the extreme metal musician fighting Poland's blasphemy laws,2021-03-18 00:00:00,"<p>Blasphemy rather comes with the territory in the world of extreme metal. Since Venom proclaimed themselves In League With Satan in 1981, antagonising Christianity has been more or less compulsory to any extreme band worth its brimstone, though this has historically tended not to result in anything more than fulmination from a pulpit.</p> <p>But not in Poland, where last month, Nergal, the leader of the successful quartet Behemoth – whose album The Satanist cracked the US Top 40 in 2014 – was convicted of blasphemy after posting a photo on social media of him treading on an image of the Virgin Mary. He’s appealing, but if the conviction is upheld he faces a fine at least, possible imprisonment, and a criminal record that will make international touring difficult.</p> <p>“This is my Instagram. This is my realm. And I’m just letting myself be myself within my realm,” Nergal says. “It’s a supposed Virgin Mary painting, because you don’t know if it’s the Virgin Mary, do you? You see the context, but you don’t know. And you see the boot. That’s all you see. It’s not like there are 10 people around me saying, ‘Hey, Nergal, what should we do to bring some attention to you?’ Because I don’t need that attention.”</p> <p>Indeed, Nergal is no stranger to controversy. While he is critical of Poland’s rightwing administration, he has been accused of being a far-right supporter himself, which he has denied. In 2017, after the Rock am Ring festival was evacuated owing to a terrorist threat, he told an interviewer: “The civilised world is at war with radical Islamists, and that’s a fact.” In 2018 he was pictured with the far-right Polish musician Rob Darken, later saying “I don’t condone Rob’s personal ideals and agenda because I don’t know them”, and was criticised last year for posting an image of a T-shirt with the legend “black metal against Antifa”, later saying: “I’m concerned about damage [Antifa] make to the scene. The ideals are OK, but the execution of them is utterly incompetent.” Even being charged with blasphemy is not a new experience: in 2010, he was charged in relation to an incident in 2007, in which he tore up a Bible on stage (the charges were dropped). And this case, he says, is one of three he is fighting simultaneously; it’s just the one he happens to have been convicted of.</p> <p>Nergal’s case is one of a rising tide of blasphemy prosecutions in Poland, often targeted at artists. In the past couple of years, with the rightwing Law and Justice party in power, the number of blasphemy prosecutions has doubled: 29 indictments were filed in 2020, against 10 in 2016. They are brought under article 196 of the country’s penal code, which demands prosecution of “whoever offends the religious feelings of other persons by publicly insulting an object of religious worship, or a place designated for public religious ceremonies”.</p> <p>As Nergal notes, the wording is meaninglessly vague: “In court I am asking, is there a thermometer of religious beliefs? Because if there is, just give me one and I will stick it up my ass and know when I am hitting some limit. But I don’t know where it is, because you are so sensitive and fragile. If they win all these cases, it will make it easy for these people to point at anything and go: ‘You know what? That hurts my religious beliefs.’” Moreover, it doesn’t require widespread offence: just four people complained about Nergal’s Instagram post. “Why are you entering my social media to get offended? They are opportunists, who want to capitalise on my back, because they know I’m an easy target and when they bring me to court they get headlines the next day – I’m their favourite scapegoat.”</p> <p>Behemoth performing live. Photograph: Grzegorz Gołębiowski</p> <p>It’s easy to write this off as trivial, but blasphemy laws are important, says Jessica Ní Mhainín, policy and campaigns manager at Index on Censorship: “The right to blaspheme, to speak irreverently, or against a prevalent dogma is an essential part of our freedom of expression. Laws that prohibit offending someone else’s religious feelings do not protect freedom of religion, they unduly curtail free speech.”</p> <p>While many other countries maintain blasphemy laws, only Poland among European nations displays any interest in enforcing them. “Blasphemy laws are completely incompatible with international conventions on freedom of expression, and human rights experts and organisations the world over continue to call for them to be repealed,” Ní Mhainín says. “International law embraces even expression that may be regarded as deeply offensive, including blasphemy.”</p> <p>Poland’s ministry of justice takes a different view, arguing the European court accepts that freedom of expression may be subject to restrictions and “carries with it obligations and responsibilities which depend on the circumstances and manner of expression,” a spokesperson for the ministry tells the Guardian via email.</p> <p>On the specific offence of blasphemy, the ministry adds: “Such statements do not enrich the public debate, nor do they lead to the development of tolerance or respect for human dignity, which are the basis of a democratic and pluralist society. The state may therefore deem it necessary to take measures to repress certain forms of expression. This is justified especially in the case of a deliberate violation of the spirit of tolerance, when, for example, the object of religious worship has been deliberately and maliciously presented in a provocative manner.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, this must be set within a wider context. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, has been open about his desire for a “culture war” to defend Catholic values. In December 2017, he told the Catholic broadcaster Radio Maryja: “We want to transform Europe, this is my dream, to re-Christianise it. We want Poland to be strong, but also to contain ... Christian values. We will defend them against the background of laicisation and a deepening consumerism.”</p> <p>Poland’s blasphemy laws matter because they are part of a wider attack on human rights. A recent blasphemy case saw LGBTQ+ activists charged for giving an image of the Virgin Mary a rainbow halo (they won their case, which Nergal sees as a sign of hope). Law and Justice is committed to fighting LBGTQ+ ideology; and earlier this year the government enforced a near-total abortion ban. Nergal sees all these things as interrelated.</p> <p>‘I’m their favourite scapegoat’ ... Nergal performing live. Photograph: Grzegorz Gołębiowski</p> <p>“You can smell that it’s not really about spirituality here; it’s all about a very shallow tradition and political power,” he says. “That’s what Polish Catholicism has always been about. It was just about the tradition; it’s a facade. It’s an elephant on porcelain legs. This case, and the women’s rights, and the LGBT thing, they are all about the violation of human rights on so many levels. And one of the levels is my department.”</p> <p>The abortion ban was opposed by a majority of Poles, and provoked mass demonstrations earlier this year. The arrest of the LGBTQ+ activist Margot last year also led to protests, which saw 48 people arrested in what has become nicknamed “Poland’s Stonewall”. Nergal, though, has to stand alone: extreme metal singers tend to scare people off. One Polish music star who has been vocal about abortion and LGBTQ+ rights refused to comment for this piece, saying: “The main topic and the main character of the article is really controversial.”</p> <p>The Polish Catholic church is facing deep problems. There have been repeated scandals involving child abuse by priests, and subsequent cover-ups. There have been enough people leaving the church that the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics has announced an investigation into the departures. Fascinatingly, Google searches for “apostasy” are at an all-time high in Poland.</p> <p>All of which gives Nergal hope. “It is amazing to see that Catholic society being disoriented: ‘What the fuck?’ It will eventually put the church where it belongs – it should be like the Czech Republic, where if you want it you go and practise your stuff. But that’s where you belong – don’t enter my life with your dirty boots, because I’ve never asked you to do so.”</p> <p>It would be easy to paint this as a generational divide: just 9% of young Poles now take a positive view of the Catholic church. However, it’s not quite so simple, Nergal warns. “I would like to think that’s the case, but then we have the dangerous growth of rightwing sympathisers. A lot of them call themselves patriots, and they mix up all these dangerous philosophies that are nationalistic and xenophobic, anti-this and anti-that, anti-LGBT, no foreigners.”</p> <p>Nergal is now taking the fight to his opponents. He has launched a crowdfunder to raise money for his defence, and any surplus will go towards the social justice campaigns kicking back against the state’s imposition of hardline Catholic values. “I am part of that anti-government tide, that massive wave of people saying: ‘Fuck no. You’re not going to make us slaves to your agenda. You’re not going to make it a Catholic state.’ We are talking about a bigger thing than a musician facing a legal problem: if you want to evolve as a country, you must go secular.”</p>",1
991072966,He pledged unity. But now PM hopes to tighten grip on war-torn Ethiopia,2021-06-20 00:00:00,"<p>Tens of millions of Ethiopians are expected to vote on Monday in crucial elections that could provide a launchpad for controversial prime minister Abiy Ahmed to consolidate his increasingly authoritarian rule.</p> <p>Abiy, who won the Nobel peace prize two years ago after concluding a peace deal with neighbouring Eritrea, will face voters at the ballot box for the first time in Africa’s second most populous nation.</p> <p>Just over a fifth of more than 500 parliamentary constituencies are not voting due to logistical problems, violence or the war in Tigray.</p> <p>The conflict in the northern region broke out in November after fighters loyal to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the region’s then-ruling party, attacked government military bases.</p> <p>Federal troops forced the TPLF to abandon its stronghold of Mekelle, Tigray’s capital, after six weeks of fighting but have struggled to end an ongoing insurgency.</p> <p>The conflict has roots in a struggle for power at a national level. The TPLF dominated the government for decades until Abiy’s appointment by the ruling coalition in 2018. It was unclear if the war would boost Abiy in the polls, analysts said.</p> <p>“At the beginning, the war was good for Abiy. The TPLF had been in power for a long time and had done a lot of crimes. They were very unpopular. But now there is a very costly stalemate, it is much more of a problem for [Abiy],” said Yohannes Woldemariam, a US-based independent analyst.</p> <p>Supporters of the prime minister are hoping the elections will strengthen his new Prosperity party. The election was originally scheduled for August 2020 but was delayed, with officials blaming the Covid-19 pandemic. It will involve candidates from more than 40 parties.</p> <p>Campaigning has been short. Abiy, a 44-year-old former military intelligence specialist, told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters last week at his only rally that Ethiopia would show a sceptical world that he could unite his fractious country.</p> <p>“The whole world is saying we will fight [each other] but we will show them differently,” Abiy told a packed stadium in the western city of Jimma. “The forces that saved Ethiopia from collapsing will turn the horn of Africa into Africa’s power hub.”</p> <p>Violence in Ethiopia, a patchwork of ethnic and linguistic groups theoretically united by a federal system, has surged since Abiy took power and implemented a series of wide-ranging reforms.</p> <p>In his first 18 months in power, Abiy freed more than 40,000 political prisoners, brought many more women into high office, lifted a ban on political parties, allowed more media freedom and opened up sectors of the economy. But jails are filling up again, with thousands reportedly held in military camps and more than 20 journalists imprisoned in the past year.</p> <p>“The situation now is as dire as it used to be before, if not more,” said Fisseha Tekle of Amnesty International.</p> <p>Many parties in Oromiya, the nation’s most populous region and site of last week’s rally, are boycotting the polls, alleging government intimidation.</p> <p>Whatever the results of this week’s poll – and Abiy is not expected to lose – he will have to deal with a looming economic crisis. The country of 110 million faces an acute lack of foreign currency and has sought unsuccessfully to defer debt repayments.</p> <p>Billene Seyoum, the prime minister’s spokeswoman, has described the election as a chance for citizens to “exercise their democratic rights” and accused the international media of mounting a “character assassination of the prime minister”.</p> <p>Western diplomats and humanitarian agencies say that 350,000 people in Tigray are now suffering famine, with many millions more threatened by acute lack of food.</p> <p>Diplomats warned that if the promised changes did not follow the polls, further collective international pressure would be applied, insisting “if nothing is done, this is going to be an entirely man-made famine”. They said they had received private assurances from senior Ethiopian ministers that restrictions on humanitarian access to famine areas could be eased once the elections were over.</p> <p>The UK ambassador at the UN, Barbara Woodward, has already warned: “It’s not a drought or locusts that are causing this hunger, but the decisions of those in power.”</p> <p>So far Ethiopia has ignored traditional diplomatic levers. These include two successive G7 statements, withdrawal of EU funding from the Ethiopian government, and the imposition by the US of visa sanctions on some Ethiopian officials.</p> <p>The Observer, Guardian and other media have reported a series of massacres over the last six months, with the most recent just weeks ago. Both Ethiopian and Eritrean troops – who entered Tigray to support the government – appear responsible. At least one massacre has been blamed on the TPLF.</p> <p>Eritrea spent months denying its troops were in Tigray, but since acknowledging their presence has repeatedly denied any accusations of atrocities. Ethiopian officials have repeatedly said that Eritrean troops would withdraw, but there has been little movement on the ground.</p> <p>In one revealing recent incident, a UN truck carrying Eritrean refugees who had lived for many years in Tigray to a camp for displaced people was stopped at a checkpoint approximately 100 miles from the Eritrean border by Eritrean troops, who then forcibly repatriated 38 of them. Only after strong protests from the UN were the refugees returned from Eritrea.</p> <p>Analysts say it is unclear whether Abiy wants the Eritrean troops to remain to fight the TPLF, or has been unable to convince Isaias Afwerki, the veteran dictator who has led Eritrea since its independence in 1993, to pull his forces out. “It has become a survival game for all of them and they all see their survival as being at the expense of the others. It is very sad,” said Woldemariam.</p> <p>Abiy’s rhetoric has been uncompromising. While inaugurating a sugar factory in the northern Amhara region on 6 June, he told supporters that Ethiopians face two challenges - “traitors and outsiders”.</p> <p>“Everyone is expected to first purge traitors and next to stop outsiders,” he said.</p>",1

Ressa was sentenced to up to 6 years in jail, but can post bail and appeal the ruling.</p> <p>“The government, in getting this case to the court, had to do legal acrobatics,” Ressa, who’s also facing cases for alleged tax evasion and media foreign ownership violation, told ABS-CBN News over the weekend. “We have done nothing wrong.”</p> <p>Ressa’s online libel case “sets a dangerous precedent” and “is seen deleterious to press freedom,” said journalism professor Danilo Arao from the University of the Philippines. It may also have a chilling effect on social media users critical of the government, he added.</p> <p>Duterte’s government values free speech and upholds press freedom “by safeguarding the media environment and the media workers,” Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a June 5 statement. Last month, the Philippines’ largest broadcaster ABS-CBN Corp. was ordered shut by the government after its permit lapsed.</p> <p>Read more about:</p> <p>SHARE:</p>",1
968478223,NI police chief: I’m in no one’s pocket,2021-02-08 00:58:20,"<p>Northern Ireland’s chief constable denied being in anyone’s pocket as he expressed concern police were being used as a shock absorber in intensifying political clashes.</p> <p>Simon Byrne also rejected claims commanders had scapegoated two inexperienced officers sanctioned after a controversial operation that saw a Troubles survivor arrested at a memorial event for victims of a loyalist atrocity.</p> <p>In an interview with the PA news agency, Mr Byrne dismissed allegations levelled from both sides of Northern Ireland’s traditional political divide that the police adopt different approaches for different communities.</p> <p>“We have been bashed frankly by recent events and it just seems sometimes that we can’t seem to win,” he said.</p> <p>The police chief again made clear he had no intention of resigning.</p> <p>“It’s been a tough week, but I’m not the first chief constable here that’s had to suffer or be accountable…for criticism over the last 50 years,” he said.</p> <p>“Actually quitting is the easy thing and whatever next week looks like, frankly, the in-tray is the same and I’m just determined to carry on with the support of my team to actually deliver what we set out to do.”</p> <p>Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said there was crisis of confidence in policing within nationalism (Liam McBurney/PA)</p> <p>Over the weekend Sinn Fein claimed there was a nationalist crisis of confidence in policing after officers intervened at the commemoration for victims of a loyalist massacre at a bookmakers shop on the Ormeau Road.</p> <p>Angry scenes unfolded when police challenged participants amid suspicions the size of the public gathering breached coronavirus regulations.</p> <p>Mark Sykes, who was shot several times in the 1992 outrage, was handcuffed and arrested in chaotic exchanges captured on social media.</p> <p>Mr Sykes was released a short time later.</p> <p>The conduct of the two sanctioned officers is being examined by the independent watchdog, the NI Police Ombudsman.</p> <p>The episode followed just days after police officers failed to arrest anyone when they encountered a large gathering of masked loyalists staging an apparent show of strength in east Belfast.</p> <p>Sinn Fein has highlighted the two incidents as evidence of two-tier policing.</p> <p>The incidents came in a week when police were also dealing with increasing tensions over Brexit that led to the withdrawal of staff conducting trade checks at Larne and Belfast ports amid safety concerns.</p> <p>“I think this has been a unique week, I’ve never known anything like it in my professional police experience,” Mr Byrne told PA.</p> <p>The PSNI has also been facing claims of discriminatory policing from loyalists and unionists, who are angry that officers have not intervened when large crowds have gathered for the funerals of former IRA men.</p> <p>The funeral of Bobby Storey created a political controversy in Northern Ireland (Liam McBurney/PA).</p> <p>The most high profile of these occurred last June when senior Sinn Fein figures joined hundred of mourners at the funeral of well-known republican Bobby Storey.</p> <p>“Sometimes you just feel like we can’t do right for doing wrong,” said Mr Byrne.</p> <p>He added: “I recognise here that there is often different and competing political views and actually sometimes the police are the shock absorbers of all of that sort of narrative.</p> <p>“I think it’s about resolve and resilience and keeping on our path to be impartial and we’re here to uphold the law.</p> <p>“I can’t stop political commentary, nor would I want to, I think it just would be important at the moment for political space, so that my officers and team and staff can carry on with the issues of policing rather than getting involved in the political debate.”</p> <p>In regard to claims from some unionists that the move to suspend one officer and reposition another was pandering to Sinn Fein, he said: “This was an objective evidence-based decision, we looked very carefully at what we did.</p> <p>“By no means was it a knee jerk, we’re not in anyone’s pocket but it was recognising this was a serious matter.”</p> <p>He denied scapegoating the two officers, who only joined the PSNI last July.</p> <p>“We weren’t influenced by anybody else, we weren’t pandering to criticism or any other inferences,” he said.</p> <p>“I fully understand some of the accusations but we have to work within due process and actually look at the conduct regime that informs our decisions, sometimes they are not popular but this isn’t about scapegoating, there’s a process that will now take place, we don’t presume what the outcome is.”</p> <p>In terms of enforcing Covid regulations, Mr Byrne highlighted the challenge of keeping pace with legislation that had been changed multiple times in less than a year.</p> <p>He said: “Sometimes people say we got the balance wrong, but at the end of the day I think a number of things collide here – firstly, it’s fast law, regulations have changed, tactics have had to change to keep pace with that, but public expectations haven’t.</p> <p>“And I think frankly in terms of people’s feelings and emotions, people are tired or frustrated and want to see a route to normality and sometimes we’re caught up in all of that.”</p> <p>Mr Byrne, who will meet delegations from the DUP and Sinn Fein on Monday, added: “What I’m appealing for people is effectively to dial down the tone, for calm, wise heads to help us in a route to normality, whether it’s in the context of EU exit, policing the regulations or the day-to-day policing.</p> <p>“We have a job to do and we need the space to get on with it.”</p>",1
898829255,Delaware court refuses to revive Uber shareholder lawsuit,2020-01-13 00:00:00,"<p>FILE - In this May 30, 2019, file photo, the logo for Uber appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Ride-hailing giant Uber, along with delivery company Postmates, sued California over a new law that aims to reclassify their drivers and delivery workers as employees instead of contractors. The law, which went into effect last week, could upend the business models of the companies that shaped the so-called gig economy,"" where contract workers use smartphone apps to accept odd jobs driving or delivering goods as frequently as they wish. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)</p> <p>DOVER, DE – Delaware's Supreme Court has upheld a judge's dismissal of a shareholder lawsuit against ride-hailing company Uber and its former CEO.</p> <p>The court on Monday affirmed the judge's April ruling that the suit must be dismissed because the shareholder had failed to demand that Uber's board of directors take action itself before he filed his complaint.</p> <p>The lawsuit challenged the Uber board's approval in 2016 of former CEO Travis Kalanick's plan to pay $680 million for a startup company created by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski to develop self-driving cars.</p> <p>Levandowski was indicted in August by a federal grand jury in California on charges of stealing self-driving car technology from Google spinoff Waymo before joining forces with Uber. His lawyers have maintained his innocence.</p> <p>In the midst of a trial last year in a lawsuit filed by Waymo, Uber agreed to settle the case for $245 million.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>Kalanick, who was ousted as CEO in 2017, announced last month that he was resigning from the board of Uber, which he co-founded a decade ago. Kalanick's departure came after he sold more than $2.5 billion worth of shares in the company, more than 90% of his holdings.</p> <p>In the Delaware lawsuit, Lenza McElrath III, an Uber shareholder and former employee, alleged that Uber's board ignored the alleged theft of Google’s intellectual property and failed to conduct due diligence that would have revealed problems with the deal.</p> <p>While noting that Uber directors approved ""a flawed transaction,"" a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court nevertheless said it was not deciding the merits of the claims. Instead, the justices agreed with a Chancery Court judge that the plaintiff failed to comply with Delaware corporation law in filing the lawsuit.</p> <p>""Under Delaware law, the board of directors manages the business and affairs of the corporation, which includes deciding whether the corporation should pursue litigation against others,"" the court noted.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>A stockholder seeking to file a lawsuit on behalf of a company must first make a demand on the board to pursue the claim. If the board declines, the stockholder must try to demonstrate that the directors wrongfully refused the demand, or that asking them to take action would be ""futile"" because they were beholden to management or otherwise had conflicts of interest.</p> <p>An attorney for the shareholder had argued last year that asking Uber directors to take legal action themselves would have been futile because of their personal and professional ties to Kalanick and because many of them faced liability themselves for breaching their fiduciary duties in approving the deal.</p> <p>The Supreme Court panel disagreed, saying a majority of directors was disinterested because they had no real threat of personal liability, and that a majority of the board was also independent of Kalanick.</p>",1
935894383,"Vernon Gonsalves, 19 other inmates at Taloja jail test negative",2020-07-19 03:10:27+05:30,"<p>TWO DAYS after writer-poet Varavara Rao (80), accused in the Elgaar Parishad case, tested positive for Covid-19, 20 other inmates of Taloja Central Jail, including Vernon Gonsalves (61), a co-accused in the case, have tested negative, prison officials said Saturday.</p> <p>For a week before he was shifted to state-run JJ Hospital on July 13, Rao was admitted to the hospital ward of Taloja jail. Officials from the state prison department said after the 80-year-old tested positive, 20 inmates, including those from the hospital ward, were randomly selected and tested for Covid-19.</p> <p>“Their test results came on Saturday and all of them are negative,” said an official. Ten other inmates, tested earlier this week, are also negative, the official said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rao’s co-accused Gonsalves and 70-year-old academician Anand Teltumbde had approached the Bombay High Court on Friday seeking to be tested for the virus. Gonsalves had said that he was assigned the duty of being Rao’s aide in the prison from June 28. Rao whose medical condition was deteriorating was not able to complete daily chores by himself and was dependent on Gonsalves, who had come in close contact with him.</p> <p>Teltumbde, meanwhile, said that he was also admitted to the hospital ward and remained at the risk of contracting the infection. Prison official said Teltumbde, however, has not been tested so far as he was not in close proximity to Rao. He was tested in April when his custody was taken by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).</p> <p>So far, there have been two deaths due to the virus at Taloja Central Jail, including an inmate who died by suicide in May, whose posthumous results showed him to have been positive.</p> <p>Taloja Central Jail is the only prison in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region which is allowing new inmates. A school in Kharghar has been converted into a temporary jail to serve as a quarantine centre for new inmates before they are shifted to the main jail.</p> <p>Inmates, including Rao’s co-accused Gautam Navlakha who was kept at the school, have complained about the facilities available at the centre.</p> <p>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) this week had sent notices to the state government and the director-general of prisons calling for a report regarding appropriate medical care being provided to prisoners.</p> <p>Rao had tested positive on Thursday after being taken to J J Hospital. He is currently admitted to St George Hospital and is undergoing treatment for Covid-19. Doctors said they suspect he is suffering from dementia after a series of tests found a neurological condition, treatment for which has begun.</p>",1
893522075,Google employee says she was fired for sending internal pop-ups about labor rights,2019-12-17 00:00:00,"<p>Google has fired another employee following a showing of internal activism, marking the latest in a series of controversial terminations at the search giant.</p> <p>Kathryn Spiers, a security engineer at Google, told The Verge she was fired from the company last week after two years. As part of her duties at Google, Spiers was responsible for sending web browser notifications within the company. While Google employees navigated the web, relevant informational pop-ups would appear as employees viewed certain sites. Spiers, who worked on internal data security, had deployed similar notifications to discourage employees from acting irresponsibly with data, among other projects.</p> <p>“This was a serious violation,” says Google</p> <p>After news broke last month about Google employing a law firm known for its anti-union activities and firing four employees involved in internal activism, Spiers took it upon herself to set up a new notification for employees. When Googlers visited the law firm’s website or Google’s internal worker guidelines, they were sent a new message through a browser pop-up: “Googlers have the right to participate in protected concerted activities.” The message included a link to a labor rights notice Google was mandated to post.</p> <p>Spiers says she was put on administrative leave hours after releasing the message and was told on Friday that she was being fired from the company. Google management, she says, argued that she had sent the code without proper approval and had endangered company security. She says she had proper approval for sending the code, and she disputes that it introduced any security concerns.</p> <p>In a blog post released today, Spiers writes that “this kind of code change happens all the time” and that Google “has never reacted aggressively in response to a notification such as this in the past.”</p> <p>The company has said that it fired the four other employees for accessing information beyond what was required to do their jobs, while the former employees have disputed that they broke company policy. Like the other employees, Spiers said she has filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board.</p> <p>Spiers says the company is “making Google less transparent”</p> <p>A Google spokesperson declined to confirm Spiers’ termination, but they said the company had fired someone last week for misusing the browser notification, and it had also disciplined two others as part of the incident.</p> <p>The spokesperson said the content of the message wasn’t at issue and that management would have taken similar action if the tool had been used to send any message not related to security. “We dismissed an employee who abused privileged access to modify an internal security tool,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “This was a serious violation.”</p> <p>The recent terminations are only one sign of escalating tensions at Google where workers have protested for years against decisions like Google’s plans for a censored Chinese search engine, work with the Pentagon, and handling of sexual harassment allegations.</p> <p>Last month, CEO Sundar Pichai said the company would scale back its weekly TGIF meetings, where employees hear directly from executives, and that the discussions would be limited to “product and business strategy.”</p> <p>Spiers says Google’s stance toward employee activism will have damaging effects on the company as a whole. “The steps Google are taking are making Google less transparent and therefore less trustworthy,” she says.</p>",1

917387327,Covid-19 and the suppression of freedom of expression (...,2020-04-09 00:00:00,"<p>A woman has her hands sanitised by a municipal police officer in Mbare, Zimbabwe on 6 April 2020. Zimbabwe is undergoing a 21-day nationwide lockdown decreed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in a bid to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.(Photo: EPA-EFE / Aaron Ufumeli)</p> <p>To people from other countries, this might sound like a perfectly acceptable message from a president during a time of crisis. However, this is Zimbabwe – a country where the president believes people are using social media to plot to remove him from power. A country where anyone who questions the government is accused of causing ‘alarm and despondency’.</p> <p>This was nothing short of a declaration of war on free speech during the lockdown.</p> <p>The government then announced the Public Health (Covid-19 Prevention, Containment and Treatment) Regulations 2020. One of the sections deals with “false reporting during the national lockdown”. It says:</p> <p>“14. For the avoidance of doubt any person who publishes or communicates false news about any public officer, official, or enforcement officer involved with enforcing or implementing the national lockdown in his or her capacity as such, or about any private individual that has the effect of prejudicing the State’s enforcement of the national lockdown, shall be liable for prosecution under section 31 of the Criminal law Code (“Publishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to the state”) and liable to the penalty there provided, that is to say, a fine up to or exceeding twenty years or both.”</p> <p>In the wrong hands, this law will be used to terrorise journalists and silence dissenting voices during the lockdown. In a country where law enforcement officers conflate the state and the party, how many people will be arrested for criticising the ruling party?</p> <p>In a country where everything on social media that exposes the government’s misdeeds or tries to hold the government to account is considered false reporting, how can Zimbabweans be sure they are safe when they expose those crimes?</p> <p>There have already been several reports of abuse of journalists by the police.</p> <p>On 4 April, the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA Zimbabwe) posted a tweet saying freelance journalist Panashe Makufa was beaten up by the police in the Harare suburb of Kuwadzana while undertaking his professional duties. Makufa told MISA that he had been taking pictures of a police operation. He was arrested, assaulted and forced to delete the pictures.</p> <p>On 3 March, Mutare police arrested another journalist, Tatenda Julius, who was released after spending a night in prison and fined $500 for ‘criminal nuisance”.</p> <p>In Chinhoyi, a journalist from the Newsday newspaper, Nunurai Jena, was arrested as he was taking pictures of police operations at a checkpoint and charged with disorderly conduct in a public place. Another journalist, Kudzanai Musengi, was arrested for using a 2019 accreditation card but was released after police were given a directive to let him go.</p> <p>On 29 March, Mangwana posted a picture he said was of a ventilator produced by the Harare Institute of Technology, which he said he had seen for himself. He said the institution had the potential to make 40 ventilators a day. Many Zimbabweans were excited to hear the news but became sceptical after Mangwana refused to answer more questions about the ventilators. He received a tweet from Siphosami Malunga, director of OSISA:</p> <p>“But seriously Nick, we expect you to be saying for example that the country needs 1,000 ventilators, 1,000 isolation beds, 10,0000 PPE so we can mobilise our networks to provide this. It’s too late to look good here. We need to focus on saving lives.”</p> <p>With characteristic arrogance, the he responded, “That information will be given. For now I gave this one.”</p> <p>And that was the last we heard of the ventilators.</p> <p>On 30 March, Minister of Finance Mthuli Ncube announced that “treasury has set aside resources to cover one million vulnerable households under a Cash Transfer program and payment will commence immediately”. He also said $200-million a month will be set aside for the program over the next three months.</p> <p>This left Zimbabweans wondering how the government had come up with the figure of one million households. Had the households been identified already? If so, who were they? What criteria was used? Above all, what were the households to do with $200 (R100) a month? Two kilograms of rice costs $95, 2l of cooking oil is $100. A typical Zimbabwean household has an average of six people. How could they survive on $200 per month?</p> <p>Nobody was available to answer questions and one week later – seven days into the lockdown – there is no information about the facility.</p> <p>On Tuesday 31 March, the second day of the lockdown, the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe decided to hand down a judgement that had been pending for some time in a matter regarding the leadership of the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T).</p> <p>Judiciary rushes to judgement</p> <p>The delivery of this judgment by the highest court in the country, one day into the lockdown, was shocking to many as the Chief Justice had announced two days earlier that the courts would be closed except for urgent matters.</p> <p>This decision was in no way urgent given that it was a case that had been pending for at least three years, with the appeal having been lodged almost a year before.</p> <p>As expected by many, the court ruled that Nelson Chamisa is not the leader of the MDC-T and should step down immediately. Before the court proceedings, the police had already barricaded roads leading to Morgan Tsvangirai House, the MDC-T headquarters. This indicated that they knew beforehand what the judgement would be, showing once again how the judiciary and police are used to fight ZANU-PF battles.</p> <p>The same courts which ruled that the November 2017 coup was constitutional are the ones that ruled last Tuesday that Chamisa’s rise to power in his political party was unconstitutional. The double standards and hypocrisy are breathtaking.</p> <p>But what is truly appalling is the fact that our ZANU-PF government had no qualms in relying on the courts to take advantage of a pandemic that is devastating the world – by using the lockdown to settle political scores. They knew that, because of the lockdown, supporters of Nelson Chamisa and the MDC would be unable to publicly protest the ruling.</p> <p>How are Zimbabweans meant to take the lockdown seriously when those who imposed it abuse it in this manner?</p> <p>There have been reports of police brutality, with videos of citizens found outside their homes being severely beaten, arrested and piled up in trucks in Bulawayo after being accused of breaking lockdown laws.</p> <p>Despite the announcement by the president that farmers and food providers are essential services and would not be disrupted, there have been countless documented cases of police confiscating food from traders and destroying it.</p> <p>This is a country in which millions face starvation. A country in which the majority is either unemployed or underemployed. How do we begin to justify such heartless destruction of food and livelihoods?</p> <p>Many Zimbabweans have no transport and have to walk to access any essential services. Police, therefore, are not meant to arrest people indiscriminately. When I went to the pharmacy, I found queues for mealie-meal all over town. People were not maintaining physical distancing and expressed desperation at the food shortages. Right now, mealie-meal shortages are the biggest threat to the effectiveness of the lockdown.</p> <p>But even this has provided an opportunity for corruption. Police, who control the queues, are accused of buying mealie-meal and reselling it at a profit on the black market. In response to the public outcry, President Mnangagwa was forced to issue a statement to instruct the police to stop preventing traders from selling and citizens from buying food. However, it does not seem to be consistently complied with.</p> <p>Thanks to an insensitive government, it never rains in Zimbabwe. It only pours.</p> <p>On 4 April, Zimbabweans woke up to an announcement that the government had increased the price of fuel by $3 – or 16%. The reason for the increase has not been explained.</p> <p>It is inexplicable that the government would consider it wise to increase the price of fuel right in the middle of a lockdown in which economic conditions are already severely constrained.</p> <p>Most Zimbabweans are all too aware that fuel is a strategic target for corruption by ZANU-PF and Sakunda Fuels which is run by Kuda Tagwirei, a close ally of both Mnangagwa and his deputy Constantino Chiwenga. Sakunda has a monopoly on importing fuel and retails it via fuel stations in which senior ZANU-PF officials reportedly have an interest.</p> <p>From all the above it is quite evident that the lockdown has little or nothing to do with trying to curb the spread of Covid-19 and everything to do with the state reminding people of its “might”, while also seizing the opportunity to advance its corrupt interests. They embark on these displays of power every once in a while where police and the army use unnecessary and unjustifiable levels of force, simply because they feel people need to be reminded of who is in charge.</p> <p>On Monday 6 April, the Chronicle newspaper reported that the army has been roped in to boost police in enforcing the lockdown. Judging from past experiences, this is unlikely to end well.</p> <p>With regard to Covid-19’s presence in Zimbabwe, by 7 April only 349 people had been tested – 11 of them positive. People have accused the government of under-testing so as to keep the infection rate low.</p> <p>The only testing centre is in the capital, Harare. And the only isolation hospital ready for handling Covid-19 is also in Harare. Reports indicate that there are nowhere near enough beds if the virus takes hold in the city.</p> <p>In a country with 10 provinces, it is unacceptable to have everything located in just one. It is dangerous and negligent.</p> <p>On the brighter side …</p> <p>On a more upbeat note, there are efforts and initiatives by business, civil society and religious groups to respond to the threat of the virus. Also encouraging is the fact that despite their mistrust and frustration, most Zimbabweans are adhering to the lockdown. Zimbabwe has a high literacy rate and most people understand how dangerous Covid-19 is and the extent to which it could devastate us if we do not do our part.</p> <p>If mealie-meal is made readily available in the shops; if vendors are taught how to observe physical distancing while trading; and if water availability improves especially in the high-density suburbs, Zimbabwe might well be able to prevent the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Because of the monopoly, the government holds on information concerning Covid-19 in Zimbabwe, nobody really knows for sure exactly how big a problem it is in the country. Going by government statistics that show no spread of the disease since the ninth case on 2 April, one might be forgiven for hoping that we have, to some extent, been spared.

995693646,Ethiopia’s Tigray forces say they freed 1 000 captured soldiers,2021-07-19 13:00:57,"<p>Forces in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region have released around 1 000 government soldiers captured during recent fighting, the head of its ruling party said, as both sides prepared for a showdown over contested land in the west of the region.</p> <p>Debretsion Gebremichael, leader of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), told Reuters by satellite phone late on Friday that they have released 1 000 low-ranking soldiers.</p> <p>“More than 5 000 (soldiers) are still with us, and we will keep the senior officers who will face trial,” he said.</p> <p>He said the soldiers had been driven to Tigray’s southern border with the Amhara region on Friday, but did not say who received them or how the release was negotiated.</p> <p>Reuters could not independently confirm his account.</p> <p>A military spokesman said he was not immediately available to comment on Saturday, and the spokesman for the Amhara regional administration said he had no information on the release.</p> <p>Officials in Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s office and a government taskforce on Tigray did not answer calls seeking comment.</p> <p>Fighting broke out in Tigray in November when the government accused the TPLF of attacking military bases across the region, which the party denied. The government declared victory three weeks later when it took control of the regional capital, Mekelle, but the TPLF kept fighting.</p> <p>In a dramatic turn, the TPLF retook Mekelle and most of Tigray at the end of June, after the government pulled out its soldiers and declared a unilateral ceasefire.</p> <p>However, the TPLF vowed to keep fighting until it had regained control of disputed territory in the south and west of Tigray that was seized during the fighting by the government’s allies from Amhara.</p> <p>Abiy said this week that the military would repel any TPLF threat, effectively abandoning the self-declared truce. Amhara and three other regions said they were mobilizing forces to support the national army in its fight against the TPLF.</p> <p>Thousands of people have died in the fighting; around 2 million have been displaced and more than 5 million rely on emergency food aid.</p> <p>On Saturday, the state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation quoted Addis Ababa’s Police Commissioner Getu Argaw Debela as saying they had arrested 323 people suspected of supporting the TPLF, weapons possession or violating the constitution, among other charges.</p> <p>Debela said police had also shut businesses belonging to the suspects while they investigated them.</p> <p>This week, Reuters reported that police had detained hundreds of Tigrayans in Addis Ababa since late June, when federal government troops lost control of the Tigray capital.</p> <p>On Friday, Ethiopia’s foreign ministry issued a statement accusing aid groups of arming rebels.</p> <p>“Some aid agencies have been actively engaged in a destructive role. We have also confirmed that they have been using aid as a cover and are arming the rebel groups to prolong the conflicts,” it said.</p> <p>The statement did not identify the groups and there was no immediate response from the agencies that operate in Tigray.

963318547,"‘A supreme form of advocacy’: When finding a psychiatric bed seems impossible, one state’s patients have a partner",2021-01-08 00:00:00,"<p>Hallie-Beth Hollister is a master at cold calling. She has to be.</p> <p>She and a small team of psychiatric bed searchers are responsible for calling hospitals across Massachusetts any time a patient is in need of an inpatient psychiatric bed. At any given moment, 20 to 60 mental health patients are temporarily being cared for in one of the five hospital emergency departments covered by Behavioral Health Network, the Western Massachusetts-based emergency service provider where Hollister works. In complex cases, these searches have taken up to six weeks.</p> <p>But unlike most health systems across the country, her team has a special tool to speed up that search: a dedicated, state-funded system to back them up. Massachusetts is home to a novel effort known as the Expedited Psychiatric Inpatient Admissions, or EPIA. Created in 2018 by the state’s mental health department, it is designed to cut the red tape to get psychiatric patients placed in appropriate care far faster.</p> <p>advertisement</p> <p>Patients and family advocates, health providers, insurers, and hospital leaders tell STAT the program — coupled with new state incentives to bolster mental health care and bed availability — is already making a difference. And many of the program’s proponents believe it could become a national model of how to improve inpatient care for people in urgent need.</p> <p>Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:</p> <p>“We have a partner in the state who is holding this part of the system accountable to doing its job. It feels like everyone is rowing in the same direction,” said Lisa Lambert, a children’s mental health advocate with the nonprofit Parent/Professional Advocacy League.</p> <p>advertisement</p> <p>Among other changes, EPIA requires hospitals to expedite placement for patients after they’ve boarded in an ER for 60 hours — but it also provides critical logistical support to help make that possible. Once the clock starts ticking, BHN and the state’s other regional emergency service providers can immediately call on the state’s mental health department, insurance companies, and hospital administrators to escalate the admissions process and clear any barriers standing in the way of placing a patient.</p> <p>In some difficult cases, top officials at the state’s mental health department will personally make calls to expedite the process.</p> <p>“It’s a supreme form of advocacy,” said Hollister. “It’s a whole lot different when a hospital administrator gets a call from a [state] official asking if the ‘no’ one of my BHN bed searchers just received from hospital admissions was a ‘soft no’ or a ‘hard no.’”</p> <p>Research has shown that patients experiencing mental health emergencies that require hospitalization wait nearly four times longer for an inpatient bed than people with other acute issues, and more than five times as long for transfer to another facility. In large part, that’s due to a shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds or staff to care for those patients. While health workers like Hollister hunt for a bed, patients are left to wait, often in the emergency room or, occasionally, another wing of the hospital.</p> <p>The problem is especially dire for the growing number of young people with mental health conditions. In Massachusetts, only 340 of the state’s 2,717 psychiatric beds are now available to patients under 18. There are none available for those younger patients in Western Massachusetts, where Hollister’s team is based.</p> <p>“Before the protocol went in place, families called hospitals directly and found that the admissions person had never heard of their child. Some places didn’t keep lists, sometimes mobile crisis teams described kids but didn’t give names, etc.,” said Lambert. “The new protocol has pushed each hospital to have a common process so those things are less likely to happen.”</p> <p>For some parents, like Northampton’s Jamie Guerin, the program’s work, while not a panacea, is a hopeful step. A year ago, her teenage daughter was rushed to a local hospital after a suicide attempt. Guerin said the hospital tried sending her home while she was still physically ill.</p> <p>“Then she was locked in the ED,” Guerin said, adding that during the time her daughter had to board in the ER, an adult patient experiencing a psychotic episode barged into her daughter’s room. Her daughter had to board in the ER for four days before EPIA’s requirements kicked in, and she was able to be moved to an appropriate facility.</p> <p>In May, as the pandemic took hold, the state mental health department temporarily changed its policy, allowing hospitals to use EPIA for help placing patients after boarding for 24 hours. That has helped patients like Guerin’s daughter — who was hospitalized again in June 2020 — get transferred out of the ER far faster.</p> <p>“If the state had not intervened I don’t know how long she might have boarded in that ED,“ said Guerin.</p> <p>For health systems, one of EPIA’s biggest benefits is that it helps to strategically prioritize the order that patients need to be placed in inpatient beds, which are often in short supply.</p> <p>“What makes EPIA invaluable to our decentralized mental health system is that the state [mental health department] can now set a priority with a hospital for a member who is difficult to place in an inpatient bed,” said Greg Harris, associate medical director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. “When a bed opens up, they are first in line. This is the way the system should work.”</p> <p>Experts said that other state efforts will be crucial to expanding access to inpatient mental health care alongside EPIA. That includes a move last October to incentivize hospital acceptance of more patients from the state’s public MassHealth program. For at least a year, each designated hospital receives up to a daily $330 bonus for each psychiatric patient exceeding the number cared for the previous year.</p> <p>The state also recently approved $10 million in funding for the creation of new inpatient mental health acute care beds, with priority given to beds for children and adolescents in underserved areas of the state. Payments could be up to $150,000 per new bed.</p> <p>In the region of western Massachusetts where Hollister works, two hospitals are already considering plans to open new psychiatric units.</p> <p>Even with state intervention now beginning after 60 patient hours in the ER, Behavioral Health Network is also looking to fill the treatment gap with an enhanced short-term community crisis stabilization program. It serves patients waiting for psychiatric hospitalization — and in theory, helps reserve inpatient psychiatric beds for the highest-priority patients.</p> <p>“It’s a higher level of residential treatment care than previously existed in the community,” said CEO Steve Winn. “We created it for people whose needs are a little bit below inpatient care.”</p>",1

The jury took less than half an hour to reach a guilty verdict for Stokes, who was waiting on the main floor of the courthouse for the announcement.</p> <p>Stokes was last seen running across Court Street in a black shirt with purple writing on the back and jeans. He remains at large as the United States Marshal's Service is currently searching for him.</p> <p>RELATED : Jacksonville man accused of posting revenge porn</p> <p>Defense Attorney Lee Britt of Jacksonville represented Stokes, who was out on bond at the time of the trial. Onslow Assistant DA Kaelyn Sweet, who is the main prosecutor for sex offense and child abuse cases in the county, represented the state.</p> <p>During the trial, evidence showed on June 8, 2018, the victim reported to Onslow County Sheriff Detective Lindsay Kensington that pictures and videos of her performing sexual acts had been sent to her employer at Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune through Facebook.</p> <p>The pictures and videos had been created between her and Stokes during their previous relationship as the victim expected them to remain private. Evidence also showed between June 2018 and Nov. 2020, Stokes created more than 11 fictitious profiles in order to post the content to social media.</p> <p>Each post contained the full name of the victim, and many posts also contained her home address and employer information.</p> <p>ADA Sweet also provided additional evidence showing Stokes slashed the victim's tires on two separate occasions and also broke into her home to take pictures of a gun in her bedroom. The pictures were then posted on social media.</p> <p>Stokes continued telling his ex-girlfriend he would keep posting the private content until he felt satisfied that she was just as embarrassed as he was after she ended their relationship, prior to law enforcement becoming involved in the matter. The state presented evidence of those conversations, as well as photographs and social media records in addition to the testimony offered during the trial, including that of the victim.</p> <p>The defendant offered evidence from an Onslow County Civil District Court Clerk and his oldest brother, Robert Stokes. The court recorded the verdict of each charge even though Stokes was not present during the reading.</p> <p>Once Stokes has been found, the judge has ordered he will be held under no bond pending sentencing. In North Carolina, a defendant must be present for the sentencing. Due to Stokes' status as a habitual felon and his prior criminal record, he will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the North Carolina Department Adult Correction at the discretion of the court.</p> <p>Stokes has previously been convicted in Onslow County of simple assault and shoplifting on March 28, 2005; misdemeanor breaking and entering on July 27, 2005; felony breaking and entering and breaking and entering a paper currency machine on Oct. 10, 2005; felony breaking and entering and larceny on April 25, 2012; larceny by servant or employee, speeding to elude arrest, breaking and entering vehicles and financial fraud by a felon on Aug. 20, 2013; and larceny over $1,000 on June 4, according to the N.C.

1027158341,In limbo: the refugees left on the Belarusian-Polish border – a photo essay,2022-02-08 00:00:00,"<p>On 13 August last year, a villager in Ostrówka, in the east of central Poland, posted two pictures on Facebook featuring groups of men, women and children walking through the cornfields with bags on their backs.</p> <p>They were families from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraqi Kurdistan, and they were among the first asylum seekers to enter the country from Belarus. The post was accompanied by the following short text: “In the heat of day through wheat, at night through corn, they sneak through, they wander, just to get to the west. Great politics and slight refugees leave their print on the fields near Ostrówka.”</p> <p>Few could have imagined that those people were the prelude to a border crisis that would result in dozens of deaths.</p> <p>The makeshift shelter of a Syrian family with small children in the forest near Narewka, Poland</p> <p>The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had just started to organise the movement of asylum seekers with the promise of a safe passage to Europe, apparently in reprisal for sanctions that Brussels had imposed on his regime. A new migration route to the EU had opened.</p> <p>The humanitarian emergency reached its peak in November, when the Belarusian security forces escorted thousands of asylum seekers to the Polish border in an escalation of the crisis. Witnesses told the Guardian how Belarusian troops gathered groups of up to 50 people and cut the barbed wire to allow them to cross. Most of the asylum seekers were caught, and illegally and violently pushed back to Belarus by Poland’s border guards.</p> <p>But hundreds managed to escape into the forests. Trapped between the violence of the Polish authorities and false promises from the Belarusians, families lived in small tents, trying to keep warm in damp sleeping bags as night-time temperatures fell below zero.</p> <p>Polish border guards at a checkpoint near the border with Belarus and with a family who were hiding in the forest</p> <p>In response to the Belarusian threats, Poland’s hard-right government quadrupled the presence of border guards and troops in the area and created a two-mile-deep militarised zone ringed with razor-wire.</p> <p>It was a show of force not seen in the country since the end of the cold war. Dozens of checkpoints punctuate the perimeter of this so-called red zone, which is inaccessible to aid workers and journalists. The soldiers stop and search every car as police vehicles and helicopters monitor the area.</p> <p>Top, a family from Duhok, Iraq, in Narewka, Poland, after crossing from Belarus. Above left, an Iraqi woman and her baby are taken to safety by aid workers before certain capture by Polish border guards</p> <p>Every night in the forests, there is a race between border guards and aid workers to reach the asylum seekers hidden among the trees. If the Polish police arrive before the volunteers and doctors, they will probably send the migrants back to Belarus, with the risk that their health may deteriorate.</p> <p>Many of those found in the woods can barely walk after travelling long distances on foot. Some have not eaten in days. The children often have signs of hypothermia.</p> <p>The graves of asylum seekers in the Polish village of Bohoniki. Most of the people known to have died since the start of the border standoff were killed by the cold</p> <p>At least 19 people have died since the beginning of the border standoff between Poland and Belarus. Most of them froze to death. Some were buried in the village of Bohoniki, near the Polish town of Sokółka, in the heart of the forest that claimed their lives. People told the Guardian they found the bodies of refugees torn apart by animals.</p> <p>A family of asylum seekers said they had to bury their mother, covering her with leaves. “In the area of forest where migrants normally camp, you can smell an intense stench of decay,” says one resident.</p> <p>Some Polish families have been hiding desperate asylum seekers in their homes. In the attics of the cottages scattered in the forests along the border, Iraqi Kurds and Syrians tremble with cold and fear, while border guards search for them outside. If found, the Polish families who have offered them shelter risk being charged with aiding illegal immigration.</p> <p>Kamil Syller, a lawyer, top, and his wife, Maria Przyszychowska, with their daughter, above left. The green light in their home in Hajnówka, near the border, right, is a welcome sign for refugees</p> <p>Kamil Syller and his wife, Maria Przyszychowska, started a network of residents and activists who put green lights in their windows to show that their home is a temporary safe space for refugees.</p> <p>“We are trying to protect asylum seekers and now our activity has become a form of resistance,” says Kamil. “But we don’t want to be heroes and it’s becoming really frustrating.”</p> <p>The green lights have also come to the attention of the Polish authorities. For weeks, Maria and Kamil’s home has been under surveillance. Border guards patrol the streets around their home and lie in wait for people to come out of the forest so they can capture them and push them back into Belarus.</p> <p>A young Iraqi Kurd hides in a small attic.

The Polish lawyer filed papers with the European court of human rights in an effort to stop them being deported to Belarus</p> <p>According to data from Grupa Granica, a Polish network of human rights organisations, about 10,000 asylum seekers reached Germany from Belarus via Poland by December. Many others were transferred to migrant camps near the Belarus border.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to dozens of asylum applicants in the Polish city of Białystok. All said they had arrived in Minsk by buying packages from travel agencies, which, according to the refugees, appeared to be closely connected to the Belarusian authorities. Despite promises from Turkish and Belarusian airlines to limit these flights, the crisis appears to be far from over.

In this 10,000 sq metre space, patrolled by dozens of armed soldiers, about 1,000 asylum seekers are sleeping in makeshift cots made from planks and cardboard on shelving units once used for merchandise.</p> <p>There are dozens of children and elderly people, many in need of medical help. Outside, people sit around and heat up food on a wood-burning stove. There are showers but no hot water.

But their hopes were dealt a blow when Poland announced it had started building a €353m (£293m) wall along its frontier with Belarus aimed at preventing refugees from entering the country.</p> <p>Little remains of the migrants who camped at the border for months – just a pile of rags and bottles.

885619358,Looking Beyond the Senate Bill; Why Social Media is Already Regulated -By Gbenga Oloniniran,2019-11-10 09:48:35,"<p>On the 7th of November, I was also privileged to be, and to address at a Lagos colloquium which witnessed presence of the likes of Senator Shehu Sani, Femi Falana SAN, Dapo Olorunyomi, Chris Isiguzo (NUJ President), Richard Akinola, Chido Onumah and quite a number of other influential personalities, including but not limited to veteran journalists (Fisayo Soyombo inclusive) and other social activists. It was a conversation on the shrinking media and civic space in Nigeria.</p> <p>The colloquium like many of its such and other social engagements that have trailed the Senate’s passing of social media bill, is actually one of the attempts aimed at analyzing the ‘pros’ and cons of regulating social media by the Nigerian government. They all have been parts of the ways to tackle the Senate’s Social media bill. I may therefore want to take a paradigm shift from analyzing the bill, because this has been done over and over again by different persons.</p> <p>Let us point to a few statistics. In September 2019, Joseph Israel a student of Taraba State University was expelled with reasons reportedly connected to his persistent criticism of Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State through his Facebook account. In 2018, Kunle Adebajo of the University of Ibadan was rusticated in 2016 for an article on poor welfare in the institution. In what appears like sporadic attacks on the media in 2019 anyway, journalist Agba Jalingo is in prison as we speak for a press publication which met the Crossriver Governor in discomfort. Part of Sowore’s alleged offenses by the DSS/Federal government is hinged on using his media platform to insult the president and to cause revolution. To add, as most recent, is the expulsion of Ifemosu Michael by the FUNAAB management over his Facebook post which hammered on the welfare of students on the campus as being neglected by the management in question. Samuel Ogundipe was arrested and tortured after making a publication in 2018. We can go on and on, but Amnesty International had already assisted with another summarized data, which showed that since 2015, more than fifty journalists and bloggers have been arrested, detained and tortured in Nigeria.</p> <p>The above paragraph reveals the formally identified attacks on social media, but have we observed recent arbitrary ban and restrictions of Social media handles, Twitter and Facebook accounts? In this kind of restriction, the social media corporations are equally complicit. It is mostly done to notable critiques or activists in the social media. Political icons or major influencers may be spared, and if you are the type that only tweets about BB naija, Naira Marley, Aso Ebi Bella and the kinds, your freedom of expression is also in actual fact unlimited like Glo, until data and browsing experience unlimitedly disappoint you.</p> <p>Social media bill like any other restrictions on civic space has been on since the periods the government and corporations discovered that the system had actually created what could hastily aid its own collapse.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The social media bill is beyond restricting hate speech, it is also about restricting the possible fast and mass social mobilization against the status quo that may come through the internet. From the students angle, those in the 17th and 18th centuries had to go through rigorous efforts in connecting and mobilizing themselves across campuses in the country. Now, fast mobilization and information spread is done with the social media. Suspend a student in FUNAAB today, and counterparts are already aware in Zaria, Minna and across boards. Victimization on campuses is now rather more on a selected few, an action which school authorities even want to do silently as much as possible. Unlike the old days of suspending students in their scores at a time on a single campus. I delved into tertiary institutions because the culture of tyranny has been extended to these places, to the extent of stalking students social media accounts and activities. These ruling ideologies in our tertiary institutions are equally the ideologies of the ruling class. As instructed, the culture of tyrant rulers and submissive followers is built from these universities to the larger world. That is cycle Nigeria unfortunately revolves within.</p> <p>The world is advancing but Nigeria appears regressing into barbarism. Senates in other climes are discussing policies on health, education, security and climate change as they affect people’s lives, but our senators are bent on how to punish social media users. Well, I may want to pitch tent with those who think that we do not need the social media law in so far the country already has laws against libel and slander, and individuals who feel offended by media posts or press publication should explore those legal means. Quite alright, we should be having more policies that advances our human liberty than those that restrict them.</p> <p>On another hand anyway, it is not enough to debate this social media law or how it should work, but there is a major problem arising, it is that the Nigerians who elected the lawmakers have totally handed over governance to them. This absolute power is what corrupts absolutely.</p> <p>Apparently, there is no single serious bill to discuss before the Nigerian Senate that has to do with development of Nigerians, and as we know it, an idle hand is the devil’s workshop. Thus, one of the ways that might be needed to engage them on this Social media bill is for the people to begin a counter campaign which can include sponsoring bill to the house, such as #freeWiFi project for Nigerians. After all we have evolved beyond the generation of apes. Cost of internet subscriptions that is sometimes more than feeding costs is already another way for social media restriction. Without doubts, social media access has since been restricted through various means, discussing the bill in the Senate is merely about formalising the restrictions. Nigerians should not be carried away, let’s put work on their tables!</p> <p>The people should get involved in the affairs of the Senate, and in governance in general by sponsoring bills and campaigning for major demands that will lift standards of the people. Nigeria has a reasonable quota of educated population, and even more civilized minds than those that rule them. Leaving the governance to these rulers is what lasts this tyranny.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#FreeWiFINigeria</p> <p>Gbenga Oloniniran.</p> <p>[email protected]</p> <p>He also tweets at, @gbenga_von.</p>",1
982976125,Press freedom fight never stops,2021-05-03 00:00:00,"<p>COVID-19 protocols and a small courtroom would have limited the number of press seats to two. But the judge — mindful of both the Constitution and the fact that the world was watching — made a judgment call in favor of openness and the need of the media to do its job. Unlike Massachusetts, where cameras have been allowed in court for decades, this was the first time cameras were permitted in a Minneapolis courtroom.</p> <p>The moment that former police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the murder of George Floyd, the moment he was first put in handcuffs, was livestreamed from a Minneapolis courtroom. It was a victory not just for justice but for transparency and for press freedom — the kind of moment that makes this nation the envy of many around the world.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>It was a too rare victory for press freedom in a year when a worldwide pandemic and a growing cadre of extremists who have journalists in their crosshairs have combined to threaten those who spend their lives and their careers bringing truth to their readers and viewers.</p> <p>Get Today in Opinion Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday. Enter Email Sign Up</p> <p>An independent, free press is the bedrock of a democracy, ensuring accountability and transparency and exposing injustice. But this year World Press Freedom Day is more aspirational — a moment to take stock, to celebrate small triumphs like Minneapolis, but also to note that around the world press freedom has taken a hit.</p> <p>The 2021 World Press Freedom Index, released last week by Reporters Without Borders, found news coverage is “totally blocked or seriously impeded” in 73 nations and “constrained” in 59 others. That’s 132 countries of the 180 nations included in the survey.</p> <p>“The pandemic has been used as grounds to block journalists’ access to information sources, and reporting in the field,” Reporters Without Borders (RSF) secretary-general Christophe Deloire said in an online news conference, announcing this year’s index. “This closing of accesses contradicts with the basic principle of journalism.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Even more worrisome, he added, “We cannot even trust that the access will be restored when the pandemic will be over.”</p> <p>Autocrats around the globe have used the pandemic to solidify control of social media. China remains in its usual cellar-dweller location at 177 for its continuing internet censorship and ceaseless propaganda efforts. Elsewhere governments banned the publication of “unofficial” pandemic death tolls — Egypt (ranked 166), El Salvador (82), and Tanzania (124) were among them.</p> <p>And Donald Trump may be gone from the White House, but false cries of “fake news” still echo among those autocrats who have the most to fear from honest reporting — the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, and Hungary’s Viktor Orban, among them. In Hungary (92 on RSF’s list) publishing “fake news” now carries a prison term of up to five years. And, of course, “fake” is whatever Orban says is fake.</p> <p>Perhaps the most troubling part is that the annual listing is no longer about the usual suspects — but about the fact that its color-coded map has fewer “white” spots — indicating a good climate for free press — than at any time since the organization adopted its method of analysis in 2013.</p> <p>While much of Scandinavia occupies the top of the list, other European Union nations have slipped in rankings, like Greece, where a prominent journalist was killed execution-style in April, and Germany, where journalists are frequent targets of right-wing extremists.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>And that, of course, brings us to the United States and its not-much-to-be-proud of 44th ranking. The US Press Freedom Tracker, run by a coalition of press freedom advocacy groups, has currently documented at least 29 journalists who have been arrested or detained in the course of their reporting this year alone. (Some 15 journalists were detained by police while covering protests in Brooklyn Center, Minn., following the shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright by a police officer during a traffic stop in April.) Last year more than 400 journalists were assaulted here — just for doing their jobs — more than 100 reported having their equipment intentionally damaged while on the job, and 137 were arrested or detained.</p> <p>Compared to some dark corners of the world where journalists are thrown into a cell and never heard from again, this nation remains a bastion of freedom — where triumphs like the first-time gavel-to-gavel coverage of the Chauvin trial are still possible. But it is far from perfect.</p> <p>Today there remain too many places where press credentials are not a guarantee of access but an invitation to abuse.</p> <p>And still our colleagues around the world armed with notebooks and recorders and cameras do their job — its obvious hazards notwithstanding. We are indeed in this together — together pushing the envelope that is press freedom not for ourselves, but for all those who deserve access to information and to the unvarnished truths that make for better government.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Editorials represent the views of the Boston Globe Editorial Board.

970443629,Activists demand Calif. DA drop felony charges against vandals who toppled Junipero Serra statue,2021-02-18 19:07:00-05:00,"<p>Activists demand Calif. DA drop felony charges against vandals who toppled Junipero Serra statue</p> <p>Months after the statue of a Catholic saint was vandalized and toppled by rioters, activists are calling on a California district attorney to drop charges against the perpetrators.</p> <p>On Columbus Day last year, referred to by some as Indigenous People’s Day, a group of vandals toppled a statue of St. Junipero Serra located outside the Mission San Rafael in San Rafael, California. As The Christian Post previously reported, five people were “arrested on vandalism charges for knocking over the Serra statue, leaving only the feet attached to the base.”</p> <p>According to the Marin Independent Journal, “A complaint filed by [Marin County District Attorney Lori] Frugoli’s office in November accuses five suspects of causing at least $10,000 in damage. Under state law, vandalism is considered a felony if the damage exceeds $400.”</p> <p>A group called Decolonizers Defense has set up a petition calling on Frugoli to “Drop the Charges Against the Indigenous People’s Day 5.” The petition noted that felony charges were filed against five of the 50 protesters.</p> <p>“5 Indigenous women and two spirit racial justice activists are being charge(d) with felonies,” read a graphic accompanying the petition. The graphic, which urged Frugoli to “Drop the Charges,” was also emblazoned with the phrase “no more monuments to murderers.”</p> <p>The petition suggests that the monument's destruction was justified because Serra was “a notoriously violent mission leader known for imprisoning and enslaving Indigenous people.” It also slammed the city of San Rafael for “refusing to recognize the harms perpetrated against Indigenous people” and maintained that “this is a critical moment to resist increasing repression and support decolonial activists in your community.”</p> <p>As of Thursday afternoon, the petition had garnered more than 75,420 signatures out of a goal of 150,000.</p> <p>Statues of the 18th century priest were targeted because of his ties to Spanish expansion in North America. In 1769, Serra led the first group of missionaries into California.</p> <p>In addition to calling on Frugoli to drop the charges against the “Indigenous People’s Day 5,” the petition offered additional suggestions on how to help support the aforementioned protesters. These tips included a call to “encourage Mission San Rafael to consider how they might begin to reconcile with the violence of their founding” and “learn about the history of the land you are on, learn about the Indigenous People it was stolen from, (and) find a way to recognize your place in this lineage and contribute to its healing.”</p> <p>A letter written by a group called The Indigenous Peoples Day 5 Coalition accuses Frugoli of “targeting “ ""Indigenous women and two Spirited People."" According to the signatories, the charging of the five protesters constitutes a “continuation of the legacy of anti-Indigenous violence that persists to this day.”</p> <p>“By charging only Indigenous people, you are aligning yourself with the dangerous trend toward repression of BIPOC activists and those speaking up against violent, genocidal figures such as Junipero Serra,” they wrote in part.</p> <p>“This is the moment to take a stance in support of recognizing that the removal of this statute was in and of itself a response to the brutal and racist violence that is central to Junipero Serra’s legacy. We are writing to urge you to act in accordance with your own stated values, those of standing against racism in Marin, and drop the charges now against the Indigenous Peoples Day 5,” the letter continued.</p> <p>More than 40 groups and individuals signed the letter, including First Congressional Church in Ripon, California, University of California Davis professor Erin Gray, the Ohio Women’s Alliance and CodePink Women for Peace, East Bay Chapter. The website for the Indigenous Peoples Day 5 Solidarity Coalition described Serra as a “murderous abuser of Indigenous people, notorious for imprisoning and enslaving Indigenous people in what is now known as California.”</p> <p>Last summer, Bishop Robert Barron of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles delivered a homily defending Serra's legacy. “Do you know in 1773, Junipero Serra made his way, of course, by foot, in constant pain from Carmel all the way to Mexico City to argue for a bill of rights for the Native peoples?” he asked.</p> <p>Barron also pushed back on the depiction of “evangelization as some sort of cultural aggression,” explaining that “Serra wanted to share what he quite rightly took to be the most precious give you could ever give.”</p> <p>Similarly, the California Catholic Conference of Bishops and Salvatore Cordileone, the archbishop of San Francisco, said critics of the saint were making false claims that he was involved in the genocide of indigenous people.</p> <p>""St. Serra made heroic sacrifices to protect the Indigenous people of California from their Spanish conquerors, especially the soldiers,"" Cordileone said in a statement released in July. ""Even with his infirmed leg which caused him such pain, he walked all the way to Mexico City to obtain special faculties of governance from the Viceroy of Spain in order to discipline the military who were abusing the Indians. And then he walked back to California.</p> <p>""And lest there be any doubt, we have a physical reminder to this day: everywhere there is a presidio (soldiers’ barracks) associated with a mission in the chain of 21 missions that he founded, the presidio is miles away from the mission itself and the school. St. Junipero Serra also offered them the best thing he had: the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ, which he and his fellow Franciscan friars did through education, health care, and training in the agrarian arts, he added.</p>",1

922107802,Trump-Linked Mercenaries Implicate Themselves in Failed Venezuela Coup,2020-05-06 12:10:42-05:00,"<p>In what has been labeled a new “Keystone Kops Bay of Pigs,” the latest attempt to overthrow the government of Nicolas Maduro failed spectacularly, as both American and Venezuelan paramilitaries were immediately overwhelmed when they came into contact with the navy, or even with armed local fishermen’s collectives. Last Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that his plans for “restoring democracy” in Venezuela were “gaining momentum” and that he had already made plans to reopen the American embassy in Caracas. The next day, Washington’s regime change specialist John Bolton cryptically announced that “morning is coming to Venezuela again” soon.</p> <p>By Sunday, the coup plotters were lying face down on the concrete, zip-tied, some appearing to have wet themselves in terror when coming into contact with the employees of the “house of socialist fisherman” in the sleepy coastal village of Chuao. The Trump administration immediately denied all involvement, “it has nothing to do with our government,” the president said yesterday. But as the dust settled, the mercenaries immediately began implicating each other – and the U.S.</p> <p>Asked why there were two “gringos” with him, one detainee responded that they were the “security chiefs of the president of the United States; of Donald Trump.” The “gringos” were later confirmed as former Special Forces operators Luke Denman and Aaron Berry, who helpfully brought their passports and even their VA discount cards to the insurrection. The mastermind behind the plan, John Goudreau, also confirmed their identities. Goudreau is a former Green Beret who founded private Florida-based mercenary force Silvercorp in 2018. Silvercorp’s Instagram page even featured now-deleted posts showing Goudreau and his men posing with MAGA hats and running private security for Trump at campaign events. C-SPAN footage of a Trump rally in October 2018 does indeed show them close to the president, patrolling the event. The company’s (since deleted) twitter account was even live-tweeting their secret mission, tagging Trump in a post.</p> <p>The mastermind of the foiled coup invasion of #Venezuela just so happens to work security for Trump. https://t.co/Ep8TGbDKwY — Jeb Sprague (@JebSprague) May 5, 2020</p> <p>Apparently unaware he was confessing to a capital offense, Goudreau appeared on a Venezuelan show from his home in Florida, insisting that the mission was “still ongoing, absolutely,” even as his employees were being overpowered by disgruntled lobstermen. “These guys want to fight!” he added. Goudreau also shared an eight-page document signed by Juan Guaidó, where the self-declared “interim president” promised to pay him $212 million to overthrow Maduro, seemingly oblivious to how bad it made them both look. He claims that Guaidó, notorious for fraud, had refused to pay even the $1.5 million retainer fee. “I’m out a lot of money. A LOT. But the bottom line is a lot of us came together to do this. I’ve been a freedom fighter my whole life,” he said, as an explanation as to why he continued with the plan.</p> <p>Silvercorp describes itself as “providing governments and corporations with realistic and timely solutions to irregular problems.” Apart from coup services, they also offer school shooting seminars ($2,499 for six hours), “motivation and mindset” talks ($3,999 for six hours) and a $4,999 course on what they call “advanced urban sniper tactics,” Goudrau claiming that he has “hunted the most dangerous game my entire adult life. I’m going to teach you the tools of the trade.” Thus, Silvercorp promises to teach anyone with enough money how to survive – or commit – mass shootings.</p> <p>A February poll found that American actions are highly unpopular inside Venezuela, with 83 percent of respondents opposed to an invasion and over 80 percent against the current sanctions. Why, then, did Silvercorp and others believe it could overthrow the entire country with 300 poorly trained volunteers? One reason could be the decades of pop culture propaganda aimed at the country. Parks and Recreation presented the country as a joke dictatorship where virtually anything results in an arrest, the plot of The Expendables revolves around a crack team of mercenaries easily taking out a corrupt South American dictator, while a whole series of Jack Ryan follows the CIA agent helping to bring democracy to Venezuela. Unfortunately for Washington, reality bit and Goudreau was less Jack Ryan and more Jim from The Office.</p> <p>Social media has also played its part, deleting hundreds of accounts belonging to or supporting the Venezuelan left. Indeed, Twitter deleted the accounts of Venezuela’s state-owned electricity company just before an attack on the power grid on Monday.</p> <p>In the midst of a global pandemic, Washington is prioritizing punishing its enemies and pursuing regime change around the world, at the expense of saving its own citizens’ lives. However, due to the enormous power imbalance and the long history of demonizing Venezuela, it is unlikely that there will be serious consequences for the administration for overseeing a second Bay of Pigs fiasco.</p> <p>Feature photo | Employees of Silvercorp are arrested by Venezuelan authorities after a failed coup attempt.

1038884324,Sacramento Shooting Leads to Ridiculous Anti-gun Response,2022-04-11 13:23:29,"<p>U.S.A. -(AmmoLand.com)- In the early morning hours of April 3, shoots erupted near the corner of 10th and K Street in downtown Sacramento, Calif. The shooting resulted in the tragic deaths of six people and the wounding of 12 others. Police are still investigating at press time, but the facts suggest multiple shooters were involved in the incident and that the shooting shared characteristics more in common with general street violence than the type of indiscriminate crimes typically used to promote gun control efforts.</p> <p>The incident was dubbed a “mass shooting” by many in the media. This, as Northeastern University Criminologist James Alan Fox has noted in a March 6, 2021 USA Today item titled “You’re right to be confused about the number of mass shootings,” can be misleading. The professor explained,</p> <p>A corollary concern, besides whether the threshold [for a mass shooting] is based on deaths or injuries as well, is the varying nature and location of mass shootings. [One measure of “mass shootings”] include[s] a large share of family shootings in private residences as well as gun battles related to gang conflict or illicit drug trade… What truly frightens folks are the seemingly indiscriminate and deadly shootings in public locations — a restaurant, shopping malls, theaters, churches, schools, and now supermarkets. Such dreadful events can happen to anyone, at any time, and without warning.</p> <p>Immediately after the incident, President Joe Biden put out a statement demanding more gun control. The April 3 press release demanded, “Ban ghost guns. Require background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.” The statement stood in contrast to that put out by the usually flamboyant Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose office noted that the incident was still being investigated, before offering a much milder call to “bring an end” to such violence.</p> <p>California already has four-fifths of the gun control measures that Biden proposed. Obviously, none of these measures prevented the Sacramento shooting.</p> <p>Ban on So-Called “Ghost Guns” (Privately Made Firearms)</p> <p>Cal.Penal Code § 29180 requires that a person, “prior to manufacturing or assembling a firearm,” apply to the California Department of Justice for a unique serial number. The law then demands “[w]ithin 10 days of manufacturing or assembling a firearm… the unique serial number or other mark of identification provided by the department shall be engraved or permanently affixed to the firearm.” The person is then required to notify the state that they have complied with the marking requirements of § 29180. Further, § 29180 required owners of all privately made firearms manufactured prior to enactment of the statute to comply with the statute’s marking provisions.</p> <p>Those found in violation of § 29180 face up to a year in prison for an offense involving a handgun and six months in prison for an offense involving a long-gun.</p> <p>California has also severely curtailed the sale of common parts used by firearm hobbyists to make their own firearms. Defined as “precursor parts” by Cal.Penal Code § 16531, these items are subject to the same background check requirements as firearms under state law.</p> <p>Criminalization of private transfers</p> <p>Cal.Penal Code § 28050 requires that “[a] person shall complete any sale, loan, or transfer of a firearm through” a licensed firearm dealer pursuant to a background check. Further, Cal.Penal Code § 26500 provides “[n]o person shall sell, lease, or transfer firearms unless the person has been issued a” dealer license.</p> <p>Illegal transfer of a firearm is punishable by up to six months of imprisonment.</p> <p>Ban on Commonly-Owned Semi-Automatic Firearms</p> <p>California banned commonly-owned semi-automatic firearms (often mislabeled “assault weapons”) in 1989.</p> <p>Cal.Penal Code § 30600 provides,</p> <p>Any person who, within this state, manufactures or causes to be manufactured, distributes, transports, or imports into the state, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale, or who gives or lends any assault weapon… except as provided by this chapter, is guilty of a felony, and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 for four, six, or eight years.</p> <p>Cal.Penal Code § 30605 provides, Any person who, within this state, possesses any assault weapon, except as provided in this chapter, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for a period not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.</p> <p>Ban on Standard-Capacity Magazines</p> <p>Cal.Penal Code § 16740 defines “large-capacity magazines” as “any ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds.” This definition includes the standard capacity magazines sold with America’s most popular firearms.</p> <p>Cal.Penal Code § 32310 provides,</p> <p>any person in this state who manufactures or causes to be manufactured, imports into the state, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale, or who gives, lends, buys, or receives any large-capacity magazine is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.</p> <p>and,</p> <p>any person in this state who possesses any large-capacity magazine, regardless of the date the magazine was acquired, is guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per large-capacity magazine, or is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per large-capacity magazine, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.</p> <p>The truth is that California’s gun control regime places it below the Constitutional floor when it comes to respect for the Second Amendment right. This may be made clear in the coming months in the U.S. Supreme Court case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen.</p> <p>The Suspects</p> <p>As of press time, police have made three arrests in connection with the Sacramento shooting. As these individuals have not been convicted of any crime in relation to the shooting they will be referred to as Suspect 1, Suspect 2, and Suspect 3 in order of arrest.</p> <p>According to Sacramento NBC affiliate KCRA, Suspect 1 is a 26-year-old male and was booked on charges of “assault with a firearm and being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm.” Summarizing Suspect 1’s criminal history, the news outlet reported,</p> <p>[Suspect 1] has been wanted in Riverside County since 2015. Jail records show he has an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor domestic violence charge. According to court documents, [Suspect 1] “inflicted bodily injury resulting in a traumatic condition” to his spouse. [Suspect 1] pled guilty to the charge in 2014 and was sentenced to 30 days of custody and 36 months of probation. The Riverside County District Attorney’s Office confirmed to NBC News that [Suspect 1] later violated two terms of probation: the community service requirement, and the 52-week class requirement. A $5,000 bench warrant was issued by the court in 2015. KCRA 3 Investigates also learned [Suspect 1] spent time in an Arizona prison. He was released in 2020 after serving just over a year-and-a-half for violating probation in separate felony convictions for attempt to commit aggravated assault in 2016, and a conviction on a marijuana charge in 2018.</p> <p>Suspect 2 is the 27-year-old brother of Suspect 1. According to the Sacramento Bee, Suspect 2 was booked “on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person.” The Los Angeles Times reported that Suspect 2 was also charged for being in “possession of a stolen handgun that was converted to be a fully automatic weapon.”</p> <p>In an article titled, “A D.A. issued dire warnings about the Sacramento gun battle suspect. He was released early from prison anyway,” the Los Angeles Times noted,</p> <p>The man arrested for possessing a machine gun at the scene of Sunday’s deadly shooting in Sacramento was allowed to leave prison in February despite opposition from the county’s district attorney to his early release… Almost exactly a year ago, Dist. Atty. Anne Marie Schubert’s office opposed [Suspect 2’s] release from state prison to the Board of Parole Hearings in a two-page letter… The district attorney’s office asked that he not be freed because he is a career criminal and a danger to the community.</p> <p>The district attorney’s letter explained,</p> <p>“[Suspect 2] has committed several felony violations and clearly has little regard for human life and the law, which can be shown by his conduct in his prior felony convictions of robbery, possession of a firearm and prior misdemeanor conviction of providing false information to a peace officer.”</p> <p>The paper reported that Suspect 2 was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on two felony assault charges for beating his girlfriend with a belt and entered the California state prison system in January 2018. Despite, the district attorney’s pleas, Suspect 2 was released in February 2022.</p> <p>Summarizing Suspect 2’s criminal history with firearms, the prosecutor explained,</p> <p>In January of 2013, just six months after his eighteenth birthday, [Suspect 2] was contacted by law enforcement officers. [Suspect 2] attempted to discard an assault rifle which he had concealed in his waistband under his clothing. The rifle had a pistol grip and the capacity to accept a detachable magazine in front of the pistol grip. [Suspect 2] was also found to be in possession of two fully loaded twenty-five round magazines for the assault weapon.</p> <p>Suspect 3 is a 31-year-old male and was arrested on charges of being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. According to an account from USA Today, Suspect 3 “was caught on camera wielding a firearm after the shooting, though police do not believe the weapon was used in the shootout.”</p> <p>Presented with the facts about California’s gun control regime and the criminal histories of those arrested in connection with the Sacramento shooting, it is clear that no amount of gun control could have made a difference in the Sacramento tragedy. Moreover, other criminal justice interventions, perhaps measures tailored to those who actually commit violent crime, clearly had the best chance of preventing this tragedy.</p> <p>About NRA-ILA:</p> <p>Established in 1975, the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the “lobbying” arm of the National Rifle Association of America.

Officers made contact with the suspect but he escaped and was not caught until 6.47pm, Ms Saeverud said.</p> <p>Officials believe that the man did not start killing people until police arrived on the scene.</p> <p>""From what we know now, it is reasonably clear that some, probably everyone, was killed after the police were in contact with the perpetrator,"" Ms Saeverud said.</p> <p>Speaking calmly and clearly after his arrest, the suspect told police, ""I did this,"" said Ms Svane Mathiassen.</p> <p>The suspect ""clearly described what he had done. He admitted killing the five people,"" she said.</p> <p>The attack happened in clear view of dozens of witnesses in the small town, according to onlookers.</p> <p>Erik Benum, who lives on the same road as the supermarket that was one of the crime scenes, said that he saw shop workers sheltering in doorways.</p> <p>He said: ""I saw them hiding in the corner. Then I went to see what was happening, and I saw the police moving in with a shield and rifles. It was a very strange sight.""</p> <p>The bow and arrows were just part of the killer's arsenal.

He added: ""It shakes us all when horrible things happen near us, when you least expect it, in the middle of everyday life on the open street.""</p> <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote on Twitter that he was ""shocked and saddened by the tragic news coming from Norway"".</p>",1

1015847766,"Workers in Chicago-area warehouses allege harsh, dangerous working conditions",2021-11-23 00:00:00,"<p>Dina Blouin, an Amazon warehouse worker, was handling a package of coffee when she noticed something odd.</p> <p>The package had come open, but she could barely smell it.</p> <p>“I freaked out,” Blouin said. Loss of smell is one possible symptom of contracting the coronavirus, and sure enough — she had it.</p> <p>La Voz AARP</p> <p>Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago, un servicio presentado por AARP Chicago.</p> <p>Blouin said she thinks she contracted COVID-19 while working at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Matteson.</p> <p>She said she was frightened for herself but also because her father, a 74-year-old veteran, relies on her for day-to-day care.</p> <p>In a statement, Amazon spokespersonBarbara Agrait said, “We’ve worked hard from the beginning of the pandemic to keep our employees safe and deliver for our customers — incurring more than$15 billion in coststo date — and we’ll keep doing that in months and years ahead.”</p> <p>The company has mask policies in place and have followed the guidance of federal and local health authorities since the early stages of the pandemic, Agrait said.</p> <p>The Amazon fulfillment center in Matteson, shown on in October. Mark Capapas/Sun-Times</p> <p>At a Tuesday town hall, workers from Amazon and other area facilities called for higher wages and better conditions, saying warehouses are COVID-19 hotspots, with limited mask wearing in close quarters.

940170969,"Louisiana sugarcane workers sue Lowry Farms for wage theft, breach of contract",2020-08-11 12:50:40,"<p>Every year, tens of thousands of guest workers travel to the United States on temporary visas to live and work on farms during the growing season. Farmers who apply to host guest workers through the H-2A program make all sorts of promises to them: They’re supposed to pay a certain wage (never below the federal minimum), guarantee work for a certain number of hours per week, provide housing and transportation to and from the worksite, and pay for transportation to and from the workers’ home country.</p> <p>In practice, though, those commitments aren’t honored, according to a new class action lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) on behalf of more than 2,000 migrant workers alleging rampant wage theft and other labor violations.</p> <p>The lawsuit alleges Lowry Farms Inc., a major farm labor contractor based in Arkansas, failed to reimburse workers hired to plant sugarcane in Louisiana for travel and visa expenses and underreported the number of hours they worked. As a result, workers were paid subminimum wages from 2016 to 2019.</p> <p>The suit is filed on behalf of employees Bernabé Antonio Benito and Jesus Jimenez Martinez as well as thousands of other H-2A employees of Lowry Farms who planted sugarcane in Louisiana in recent growing seasons. According to the complaint, the plaintiffs spent their own money to obtain their visas, traveling to Monterrey, Mexico, and staying overnight to complete the process, then paid for their own travel from Mexico to Louisiana. Once they began working, their contract stipulated that they should have been paid between $10.38 and $11.33 per hour depending on the year.</p>",1
938611647,"INTERVIEW: Sowore's Trial Has Exposed Hypocrisy Of Nigerian Government, Charges Against Him Baseless And Should Be Dropped—Adegboruwa",2020-08-03 00:00:00,"<p>A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, in this interview with SaharaReporters, speaks on human rights violations by the Nigerian government as the #RevolutionNow struggle clocks a year.</p> <p>What is your opinion of many human rights violations under the government of President Muhammadu Buhari?</p> <p>It is sickening. As a matter of fact, I am presently researching the case of Mr Gabriel Emperor Ogbonna, a human rights activist arrested for over 100 days now. He has been in custody despite several orders issued by the court for his release.</p> <p>Aside from my personal opinion, I think the general belief is that President Muhammadu Buhari, from his body language, encourages these abuses of the rights of citizens. This is why we have many 'awaiting trial' cases in many correctional centres in the country.</p> <p>It is unacceptable. When you check the records of this particular regime, you will notice that indeed, they have not done well in the area of respect for the liberty of Nigerians.</p> <p>I think the President should take steps to comply with provisions of the constitution on the liberty of citizens of this country.</p> <p>What would you say might have gone wrong since Nigeria has a constitution that spelt out these rights?</p> <p>Section 35, chapter 4 of the Nigerian Constitution says that every person shall be entitled to his/her liberty and no person shall be deprived of such freedom except, and in accordance with, the procedures permitted by law.</p> <p>After the right to life, guaranteed under section 33 of the constitution, liberty should be next. Any government that cannot ensure respect for the freedom of citizens doesn't qualify to describe itself as democratic.</p> <p>In this regard, the wrong aspect is that the President has elevated national security above human rights and above the liberty of citizens such that policemen hide under guise of 'national security' to violate the rights of citizens.</p> <p>We are unable to account for the whereabouts of a number of our citizens. That was why I said the human rights record of this administration is abysmal, considering the disrespect to the judicial system and court orders.</p> <p>SR - Omoyele Sowore, the publisher of SaharaReporters, was arrested last year for planning to organise a protest to demand good governance. How would you assess the trial in the light of standard legal practice?</p> <p>When you consider the experience of the publisher of SaharaReporters, Mr Omoyele Sowore, a prominent Nigerian, you can imagine what other less prominent Nigerians pass through when their constitutional rights are also being abused.</p> <p>The constitution states clearly that every citizen of Nigeria shall be entitled to freedom of expression and freedom to hold an opinion, to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.</p> <p>The court case involving Mr Sowore has further exposed the hypocrisy of the government in the area of charging people to court for exercising their rights to freedom of expression. Section 39 of our constitution allows citizens of this country to express their views and opinions without interference.</p> <p>I am not surprised that since the charge was filed against him, it has been one dingdong affair. The government has not been able to come up with any tangible proof to sustain that charge. It is clear that they couldn't sustain that charge.</p> <p>It is better to save face and withdraw the case rather than keep him in custody, and limit him to a particular town where he won't be allowed to travel to see his family members. Sowore's case is indeed a clear example of how the rights of citizens have been trampled upon by this regime over the years.</p> <p>Since the matter is still in court, we cannot comment further. Again, I hope the President would direct relevant security agencies, especially the Ministry of Justice, to do the needful in Sowore's case because he committed no crime.</p> <p>How do you think Sowore's arrest has affected agitations generally in Nigeria? Do you think it has made people more scared to demand their rights?</p> <p>I don't think so. It depends on knowing your right and being brave about it. My appeal is that the people should not give up; they should continue to stand up, to demand their rights, irrespective of political or religious affiliations.</p> <p>The abuse of human rights knows no race or religion. We should not sit down and do nothing -- when a particular regime turns our nation into a banana republic where citizens disappear at will.</p> <p>We can't continue to have a country whereby a leader doesn't want to hear another view. We cannot also have a democracy where there is no opposition. We cannot run a system, which we claim is democratic, and rallies cannot be held peacefully.</p> <p>People, who support the government, are given police protection. They hold rallies all over the country without any form of arrest, brutality, intimidation or molestation in the hands of security agencies.</p> <p>The government should be fair and apply equal standards to citizens, irrespective of their political or religious opinion. No one should get scared to exercise their franchise and fundamental human rights.</p> <p>Sowore has demanded a revolution for good governance. What do you make of the government's claim that this is treason?</p> <p>If a citizen demands revolution or demands a change and he bears no arm, if all he does is to organise a peaceful street protest to galvanise the citizens; I don't think that should qualify for treasonable felony.</p> <p>Sadly, it is the government that doesn't recognise its role. Omoyele Sowore was only following the intent of the drafters of our constitution in demanding better welfare, infrastructural development and policies that would better the life of the masses of our country.</p> <p>If you go to chapter 2 of our constitution, which we call the fundamental objective, it stated clearly that the economic capacity of Nigeria should not be concentrated in the hands of a few.</p> <p>The government is supposed to subsidise services that affect the masses like electricity, education, health, among other things because they have collected the taxes from the people, and they are holding our purse.</p> <p>They are supposed to use those funds to build roads, electricity, good schools and hospitals such that those who are unable to have access to loot our treasury can still be able to feel the impact of the state in their lives.</p> <p>I would use myself as an example. I don't think I could have afforded secondary and primary education, but for the free education policy of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Through his free education policy, I was able to go to school.</p> <p>We can't have a state whereby private universities are more than government-owned schools, a state where private jets outnumber public flights that we should have.</p> <p>The current experience we have is that the rich people are getting richer while the margin between the poor and the rich is widening every day. The middle class has been wiped off; it is either you are so rich, or you are so weak. That is not the intention of the founders of our nation.</p> <p>In that regard, I think that Mr Sowore has found support in the generality of the people of Nigeria because he is the one doing what the founders of our nation expect our leaders to do.</p> <p>There is a general opinion that the judiciary is also culpable in the abuse of human rights through slow trials and corruption that mar the system. Do you agree?</p> <p>The case of our judiciary deserves some sympathy. We need to interrogate the judges to know their plights. I have undertaken a study and discovered that the executive is deliberately at war with the judiciary. They are frustrating the judicial institutions with lack of fund and undue interference in the discharge of their responsibilities.</p> <p>Take the judiciary at the state level, for instance. Virtually the judiciary in the states is under the executive. Many judges have embraced self-timidity; they are scared to declare the law the way it is for fear of intimidation and persecution.</p> <p>Corruption in the judiciary institution is an unfortunate development. I see many judges as upright. I have had the opportunity to appear before many of them. If given the free will to perform their duties, they are capable of dispensing justice, especially to all kinds of citizens.</p> <p>Upon his election in 2015, President Buhari declared clearly that the judiciary was his headache. The constitution requires a judge to dispense justice without fear or favour. The law enforcement agencies have been doing a lot in investigating and shaming judiciary officers who have compromised their positions.</p> <p>The majority of our judges have displayed exceptional courage, despite the odds. Look at the case of Mr Sowore. Initially, the DSS acted as if they were above the law. On the day that the judge stood her ground, and gave an ultimatum of 24 hours to the DSS to obey court order, you saw that everywhere was shaking.</p> <p>They have the power, the force and people behind them, but they need to exhibit that courage to declare the law, as it is, notwithstanding what the leaders think.</p> <p>The record of the democratic experience of Nigeria is that the judiciary has been the stabilising factor in attaining our democracy. They should not shy away from that responsibility of being the last hope of the common man. They should also speak truth to power whenever there are cases of abuse on the right of citizens.</p> <p>What is your assessment of our security agencies as people have alleged they are being used as machinery to abuse the rights of citizens?</p> <p>Unfortunately, our security personnel have become tools in the hands of authorities or those in power to infringe on the rights and also privileges of citizens. They use them against us, and when they finish the job, they are dumped.</p> <p>Again, just imagine the case of Mr Sowore and how he was arrested and maltreated by the DSS operatives. These are the same set of people you are fighting, on their behalf, for a better country where everyone can remain equal.</p> <p>It is sad that these set of guys, who are our brothers, are the ones being used by the authorities to trample on our rights. They feel it is the right thing they are doing. Many of them forget that we would still meet on the streets, go to the same mall or market to get something for our family.</p> <p>So, we can't continue to have a system where the security agencies would continue abusing the rights of citizens.</p> <p>Insecurity in the country is growing worse, mostly in the north with many senseless killings, what should we do as a nation?</p> <p>I don't think there is any way we can speak louder, in terms of indictment and declaration of incompetence on our security agencies, than the National Assembly has done. The lawmakers have demanded the sack of the service chiefs.</p> <p>The attitude of our security personnel can be summarised in the proceedings of the Senate about a week ago, whereby a resolution was unanimously passed, calling for the sack of the service chiefs.</p> <p>For instance, you would have noticed that over 300 officers of the Nigeria Army voluntarily applied to be discharged from the service recently. The reason given was that there was no moral, welfare and lack of equipment.</p> <p>That is the condition of our security agencies generally. That is why there is an upsurge in crime, including the abuses of the rights of citizens.</p> <p>We now have a security apparatus, whose leader is building a university in his town. In this country, people have left the core mandates of protecting the territorial integrity of our country and ventured into the business of education.</p> <p>We have no security presently. That is why the Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, made it clear that there is a conspiracy going on in the northeast because those who attacked his convoy were not Boko Haram insurgents. They didn't want him to see the secret of what is going on in Baga.</p> <p>The Boko Haram war has become a business. It may not end, given the amount of money budgeted in prosecuting the war and because it was one of the reasons President Goodluck Jonathan was voted out of office.</p> <p>In President Buhari's hometown in Katsina, bandits have taken over. We all thought that in the first year of his government, activities of Boko Haram would have been a thing of the past. It is unfortunate to say this government has lost it, and he (Buhari) has not performed up to the expectation of Nigerians in terms of protecting lives and property.</p>",1

965087957,"Leading Indian American organisations, activists urge Indian Supreme Court to grant bail to Sanjiv Bhatt",2021-01-19 12:21:29+05:30,"<p>TCN News</p> <p>The Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC), an advocacy group dedicated to safeguarding India’s pluralist and tolerant ethos, and Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR), which is committed to the ideals of multi-religious pluralism in the United States, India and beyond, along with leading politicians, civil rights activists and organizations from India and the US have urged India’s Supreme Court in an online press conference to grant immediate bail to former police officer Sanjiv Bhatt, calling his conviction in a murder case wrong and based on fraudulent evidence.</p> <p>Support TwoCircles</p> <p>IAMC and HfHR were joined by leading personalities from India such as Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor, renowned documentary filmmaker and human rights defender Anand Patwardhan, human rights activist and artist Mallika Sarabhai and Magsaysay Award winner Sandeep Pandey in criticizing Mr. Bhatt’s conviction, predicting that it would not stand under judicial scrutiny, and urging the Supreme Court to set him free immediately in order to uphold the rule of law.</p> <p>Sanjiv Bhatt is widely believed to have been targeted only because he had claimed to be an eyewitness to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s complicity in the mass violence against Muslims during the Gujarat pogrom of 2002. The horrific violence, perpetrated by Hindu nationalist forces owing allegiance to the supremacist ideology of Hindutva, claimed the lives of over 2,000 people many of whom were raped and burnt alive. It led to the US Department of State revoking Mr. Modi’s US visa under the International Religious Freedom Act. The revocation was in place until Mr. Modi became Prime Minister of India.</p> <p>The Supreme Court of India has scheduled a bail hearing for Mr. Bhatt on January 22. Under Indian law, courts can grant bail to those convicted of various crimes, including murder, pending their appeal at higher courts. Mr. Bhatt was convicted in June 2019 for the death of a man in 1990. His defense was not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses during the brief trial, nor was it allowed to present its own witnesses or submit evidence. India’s human rights groups have called it a sham trial.</p> <p>Dr. Shashi Tharoor, currently a member of Parliament and formerly an Undersecretary General at the United Nations, said he was “outraged by the injustice meted out” to Mr. Bhatt, whose “conscientious service to society” and “indomitable capacity for speaking truth to power” had put him in jail.</p> <p>“Sanjiv’s case is a reflection of the grim times that we live in, where constitutional values and fundamental privileges that have been granted by the constitution to all Indians appear in many cases to be diluted and in many cases perhaps even supplanted by illiberal forces,” Dr. Tharoor said. “All Indians with a conscience like Sanjiv Bhatt’s must stand up and fight back against such challenges that threaten to undermine the very foundation of our republic.”</p> <p>Filmmaker and human rights defender Anand Patwardhan said Mr. Bhatt had been jailed “for no other reason than the fact that he opposed the massacre in 2002” and spoke against it. Mr. Patwardhan said the civil society “should build a movement for Mr. Bhatt’s release.”</p> <p>Human rights activist, classical dancer and actor Mallika Sarabhai said there was a “definite agenda” not only in the retribution against Mr. Bhatt but in the case of most critics of the Modi government. “If anyone speaks against the government or asks a question, which is a fundamental right of our democracy, they are somehow punished. Raids are carried out against them, false cases are brought up, fraudulent charges are made, and they are made to silence,” Ms. Sarabhai said.</p> <p>“I hope that today we will be able to appeal to the better sense of our great courts to say what is being done to Sanjiv is wrong and needs to be corrected immediately,” she said. “Vindictiveness should find no place in our courts or in any of the decisions taken. It is a sign of weakness and it is a sign of fear. And our courts can neither be weak nor fearful. I hope that our appeal will see that Sanjiv gets a fair trial and that this case is dismissed as the frivolous case that it is.”</p> <p>She said she was “deeply worried” as India’s “dependable” institutions such as the Supreme Court had “keeled over to the powers that be.” The Supreme Court was “today taking cases which are liked by the government on an urgent basis; and other cases which are extremely important and involve thousands of people have been left to stew,” she said. Dozens of human rights fighters, educators and writers were in jail without bail, “without even the slightest courtesy for their age of any other infirmity.”</p> <p>Gandhian activist and Magsaysay Award winner Sandeep Pandey said Mr. Bhatt was the “most courageous” of all police officers as he filed an affidavit stating that Narendra Modi had “chaired a meeting in which the police officers were told to go soft on the Hindutva brigade which was rampaging against the Muslims.” Mr. Pandey said that “manipulation of cases” was a “common story” in the Modi government.</p> <p>Mr. Pandey cited the case of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath, who had “16 cases against him, including a case of murder and inciting riot,” but the cases were withdrawn later. “They manipulate cases so that either the witnesses are threatened or the people who have filed the cases are threatened to withdraw the cases and the judges are influenced so that the people who have committed the crimes are not convicted.”</p> <p>If Mr. Bhatt’s affidavit was “taken seriously by the court”, proceedings will begin against Mr. Modi “and obviously that cannot happen because he is now Prime Minister. “Sanjiv is paying a price for what he did and the people who are in power are in a situation right now to be able to manipulate things, so that they can get away with their crimes. Everyone knows about it.”</p> <p>The crimes committed by Mr. Modi, India’s home minister Amit Shah and Mr. Adityanath were “well known” but because they are in power they can “evade action” against themselves.</p> <p>Renowned activist S. R. Darapuri, who is a former Inspector-General of Police in Uttar Pradesh, said he could related to Mr. Bhatt’s predicament as they both were “upright and righteous” police officers who had both been “at the receiving end of State oppression.”</p> <p>Mr. Bhatt was “not involved in any way in the case in which he has been falsely implicated. He has been prosecuted and convicted merely because he dared to expose the involvement of the then Chief Minister of Gujarat in the 2002 pogrom,” Mr. Darapuri said. Mr. Bhatt’s situation is “not unusual” as it has become the “unavoidable fate of those who dare to question the State.”</p> <p>“A large number of human rights activists and other prominent personalities who have dedicated their lives to the social cause are facing the same consequences,” said Mr. Darapuri, who was arrested in Uttar Pradesh last year for opposing the anti-Muslim Citizenship (Amendment) Act. said. “Unfortunately, our criminal justice system has been subverted to serve the interest of those in power.” The world “must recognize the impending danger of the onslaught of fascism in India, he added.</p> <p>Women’s rights activist Arundhati Dhuru said even thirty years ago in his early career Mr. Bhatt “never used the power of his baton or firearms but he always always stood by the side of the people to fight” against oppression. “This is a testing time for the honorable Supreme Court of India to uphold the same constitution by the rule of law, and take out all the charges and release [Mr. Bhatt] unconditionally.”</p> <p>Saurin Shah, Ahmedabad-based lawyer who defended Mr. Bhatt at his flawed trial, gave a detailed chronology of the case. In October 1990, Mr. Bhatt was posted at Jamnagar, Gujarat, when local police arrested 133 rioters, one of whom died 18 days after release. Importantly, none of the 133 people, including the person who died later at a private hospital, had made any allegations of police torture or brutality, even when they met a magistrate. The medical record at the jail where the rioters were imprisoned do not mention any injuries to anyone.</p> <p>The alleged murder victim, Prabhudas, was twice examined by the jail doctor and at the local government hospital, and none recorded any complaint of torture or injuries.</p> <p>Commending Mr. Bhatt as a “brave officer” who “spoke truth to power,” Raju Rajagopal, co-founder of Hindus for Human Rights, recalled that Mr. Bhatt had witnessed the “fateful decision” by Mr. Modi, who was at that time Gujarat’s chief minister, that the “law enforcement shall stand down to give Hindu nationalist organizations free rein to attack” Muslims. Mr. Bhatt had been “incessantly hounded by the authorities since that time,” Rajagopal said.</p> <p>“In 2018, he was interrogated on a decades-old case, was tried on completely bogus charges without any opportunity for the defense to call their witnesses, and was put him away for life.”</p> <p>Rasheed Ahmed, Executive Director of Indian American Muslim Council, said the Indian government must stop “politically managing Mr. Sanjiv Bhat’s case and let the law take its course under the supervision of independent judges not the judges who are either scared of government or have themselves becomes political.”</p> <p>“There is no ambiguity that Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt’s conviction and incarceration are politically motivated and that the charges against him are baseless,” Mr. Ahmed said. “The courts clearly know it but the political masters want him silenced so that their own crimes stay in the dark rooms out of the public eye.”</p> <p>Mr Ahmed said that Mr. Bhatt deserved a “fair trial and an “independent judiciary”.</p> <p>IAMC and HfHR have pledged to continue the struggle, not only to secure Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt’s release but to end the victimization of human rights defenders, journalists and whistleblowers. Both organizations expressed confidence that ultimately the forces of hate and division would be defeated in their attempt to subvert pluralism and democracy in India.</p>",1
1001549229,U.S. Action in Belarus: Responding to Lukashenko,2021-08-29 14:30:22,"<p>BISMARCK, North Dakota — As part of the former Soviet Union, it is not surprising that Belarus still has deep ties to Russia. The current president, Alexander Lukashenko leads the country with a brutal regime that appears to some citizens to cater mostly to the needs of Russia and not the citizens of Belarus. This has led many in the country to push for Lukashenko’s removal and the implementation of a truly democratic system.</p> <p>The Necessity of Democracy in Belarus</p> <p>There are several reasons for the push for democracy. One of the main reasons is the brutal human rights abuses that those within Belarus are subjected to, especially when they dissent from the government. Recently, the government has cracked down violently on protestors and journalists who it views as a threat. These human rights abuses have led to international outcry.</p> <p>While the human rights issues are at center stage, there is another reason for citizens to push for democracy in Belarus. The economy is closely tied to that of Russia, which means that growth is almost stagnant. The Soviet-era economy that still operates in Belarus may have led to shockingly low poverty numbers, but this does not tell the whole story. Belarus still operates under a Soviet-era economy with state-owned industrial and agricultural sectors. This means that even though poverty rates are low, the country is far from wealthy, especially in rural areas. Democratization would allow for more growth and more earned wealth as the economy modernized.</p> <p>The U.S. government has not ignored the situation in Belarus. U.S. action in Belarus has come from the Biden administration, Congress and the embassy in Belarus. While the administration has issued harsh statements on the situation, it is also weighing possible sanctions. Congress has held Senate hearings to learn more about the situation and determine what U.S. action in Belarus is most needed.</p> <p>President Biden’s Response</p> <p>In May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 diverted its course while over Belarussian airspace when air traffic control reported they had a bomb on board. The plane was escorted by a Belarussian MiG fighter jet. Once it landed, Belarussian authorities boarded the plane and arrested Raman Pratasevich, a dissident journalist and his girlfriend. The plane was then allowed to continue its journey. The bomb threat appeared to be fake to get the aircraft to land.</p> <p>This incident sparked outcry across the world. President Biden released a statement on the incident as well as the overall situation in Belarus. In this statement, President Biden condemned the actions taken by the Belarussian government. He also called for the release of Pratasevich as well as hundreds of other political prisoners. Additionally, he called for an international investigation into the situation in Belarus. President Biden offered his support of the call for economic sanctions against Belarus. He also vowed that U.S. action in Belarus would support the citizens seeking democracy.</p> <p>Since the president’s statement, it has also been reported that the administration is planning on imposing additional sanctions against Belarus. This action is likely to come in the form of an executive order. This new order would update the current in-use order from 2006 also could include human-rights sanctions against Lukashenko’s regime.</p> <p>The State Department has also issued a do not travel order for U.S. citizens, warning that Belarus may be unsafe. Ned Price, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department indicated during a June 3 briefing that the Belarussian government placed limitations on allowing American diplomats in the country. Price indicated that despite this, U.S. action in Belarus would continue to support the citizens seeking democracy and the U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher would still be working to support them from outside Belarus.</p> <p>Senate Hearing</p> <p>On June 9, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on U.S. action in Belarus. In this hearing, they heard from U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the Democratic Opposition in Belarus and Jamie Fly, President and CEO of Radio Free Europe.</p> <p>U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher gave testimony that starkly contradicted the portrait painted by President Lukashenko. She claimed that the Belarussian government has given up so much of its sovereignty to Vladimir Putin and Russia that it no longer has any control over Russia’s actions within Belarus.</p> <p>In her testimony, Fisher also outlined some U.S. action in Belarus taken against Lukashenko’s government. She stated that the government placed visa restrictions on those responsible for undermining Belarussian democracy. She also indicated that the U.S. sent more than $20 million in aid since August 2020 to help those in Belarus. There is another $500,000 allocated to the International Accountability Platform for Belarus pending congressional approval.</p> <p>In her testimony, Tsikhanouskaya, who has been living in exile in Lithuania since Lukashenko’s election in August 2020, called Lukashenko a “threat to international peace and security.” She urged the U.S. to impose strict sanctions against the oil sectors as well as on foreign funders of Belarus. According to her, these sanctions would make the biggest difference inside the country.</p> <p>International Solidarity</p> <p>As Lukashenko’s government continues to brutally crackdown on dissidents seeking democracy in the country, there is hope. The international community has come out against the government’s actions and vowed to help support pro-democracy activists. U.S. action in Belarus also promises to bring about a more democratic system. It will allow the citizens of Belarus to have a more democratic and more free economic system.</p> <p>– Taryn Steckler-Houle</p> <p>Photo: Flickr</p>",1

888964458,How Opposition parties in Maharashtra put on the ‘We are 162’ show,2019-11-26 00:54:09+05:30,"<p>A day before the Supreme Court is expected to give its verdict on the political turmoil over government formation in Maharashtra, the three-party coalition, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, put up a grand show, ‘We are 162’, bringing 162 MLAs together on Monday evening.</p> <p>The legislators of all three parties were brought in buses to Hotel Grand Hyatt, where 34 NCP legislators have been staying since Sunday evening. While Shiv Sena legislators (56) came from Hotel Lemon Tree in Saki Naka, another 12 NCP MLAs, who are staying at Hotel Sofitel, BKC, were brought in separate buses. The legislators were paraded before the media and also made to take an oath of the Constitution of India to be loyal to their alliance and not fall prey to any inducement by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). They also pledged not to indulge in any anti-party activity and adhere to the instructions given by the leadership of the respective parties.</p> <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Maharashtra Congress in-charge Mallikarjun Kharge, along with other top state leaders from all three parties, were present at the event.</p> <p>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</p> <p>NCP insiders said it was the idea of leader Jitendra Awhad, also the core committee member, who had earlier organised a Constitution Day walk in Mumbai, in which Sharad Pawar and several other leaders had participated. “Since Tuesday is Constitution Day, I thought we could organise something on Monday to convey the message that the MLAs of three parties would not let the principles of Constitution be destroyed in Maharashtra,” Awhad said.</p> <p>He discussed it with Milind Narvekar, secretary to Uddhav Thackeray. Narvekar spoke to Thackeray and got his approval. Meanwhile, Awhad spoke to Pawar who supported it. Once both the top leaders agreed to the plan, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat too was called for his opinion and he agreed to come on board. The idea was discussed around 11.30am and within a few hours the organisers made it reality.</p> <p>“The original plan was to conduct it at Chaityabhoomi, Dadar, but the NCP supremo said it would not be feasible. We want to show the state and judiciary that we are stating facts,” said an NCP leader.</p> <p>THE EVENT</p> <p>NCP chief Pawar used the occasion to counter the BJP’s argument that Ajit Pawar was the group leader of the NCP in legislature and had the authority to issue a whip to the party legislators. “I assure you that you will not be disqualified and I take personal responsibility for it. I have taken written opinion from former senior officers who have worked in Parliament and in the Maharashtra Legislature that once a leader is removed from the position (legislative party leader), he cannot issue a whip,” said Pawar. There are reports that Ajit Pawar may issue a whip asking NCP legislators to vote for the BJP and if not followed, the legislators may get disqualified.</p> <p>Pawar also invoked Maharashtra pride. “This is Maharashtra, we won’t tolerate anything here. We can teach a lesson [to the BJP],” he said.</p> <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray warned the BJP not to indulge in misadventure against their three-party coalition. “In the past 30 years, you have only seen our friendship. If you create more problems, we will show our might,” Thackeray said.</p> <p>THE COUNTER</p> <p>The BJP was quick to react. “The show put up by the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena is childish. They put an identification parade of their elected legislators akin to criminals. This is not just their insult, but also an insult to the mandate. They can pretend they have the support of 162 MLAs, but will they be able to show support of 145 legislators on the floor during the trust vote,’’ asked BJP leader Ashish Shelar.</p>",1

REUTERS/Carlos Barria</p> <p>DENVER (Reuters) - A 22-year-old Minnesota man was charged on Tuesday with aiding and abetting the arson of a Minneapolis police station during protests over the death of a black man under a policeman’s knee, federal prosecutors said.</p> <p>Dylan Robinson, who was arrested in Breckenridge, Colorado on Sunday, is accused of hurling a Molotov cocktail inside the Third Precinct police station in Minneapolis and igniting a fire in the building’s stairwell on May 28, according to the criminal complaint.</p> <p>Robinson appeared in U.S. district court in Denver on Tuesday to hear the charges against him, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota said in a written statement. Prosecutors said he is from Brainerd, Minnesota.</p> <p>Robinson is the second man arrested June 3 in connection to the blaze. Branden Wolfe, 23, was arrested in Minnesota and charged with one count of aiding and abetting arson, federal prosecutors said.</p> <p>The police station was set on fire during demonstrations three days after George Floyd, 46, died when former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.</p> <p>The incident was captured by a bystander’s cell phone video and led to the firing of Chauvin, who was later charged with second-degree murder. Three other Minneapolis police officers were also charged in the case.</p> <p>Authorities said they identified Robinson from social media posts and surveillance cameras. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tracked him to Breckenridge, Colorado, a mountain town about 80 miles west of Denver, where he was taken into custody, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.</p> <p>Robinson is due back in Denver federal court on Friday for a detention and removal hearing, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver told Reuters.</p>",1
884916114,Only ‘What Matters’ to Dems: NBC Pushes for Strengthening Unions,2019-11-06 00:00:00,"<p>As part of their new “What Matters” series, the segment they admitted was only meant to gauge the interests of Democratic voters, Wednesday’s NBC Nightly News sat down with Senator and 2020 hopeful Amy Klobuchar (MN) and asked her how she would help to strengthen unions in America. While, at the same time, ignoring corruption charges against United Auto Worker bosses.</p> <p>Again, anchor Lester Holt was not shy about stating the purpose of the segment. “With another debate coming up this month, we're asking what's most important to Democratic voters and Harry Smith is taking their questions to the candidates. Tonight, Senator Amy Klobuchar in our series, what matters,” he openly admitted.</p> <p>Correspondent Harry Smith was still speaking with the same group of Democratic voters in Pennsylvania as he did in the first installment, but this time the discussion was about labor:</p> <p>HARRY SMITH: How many union members or former union members? Five, six, seven. At our round table with Democratic primary voters. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I couldn't get into a union. I couldn't get health care.</p> <p>“A clear desire for the return of union strength,” he declared as if they were the oracles that knew what was best for the entire country.</p> <p>Moments later, Smith boasted: “how Americans view unions has changed dramatically in the last ten years. Nearly two-thirds of adults in the U.S. now view unions favorably.” “But union membership is at a decade's low, 10 percent of the U.S. workforce,” he would go on to lament.</p> <p>With absolutely no attempt to provide any counterpoint, Smith teed up Klobuchar to preach to NBC viewers about how great unions allegedly were:</p> <p>SMITH: What goes through your mind? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN) That they’re right. That they get it. SMITH: We talked with Senator Amy Klobuchar at home. To her, unions are a family matter. KLOBUCHAR: I literally am here as the granddaughter of a union member, an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and union member, the daughter of a newspaper-man and a union member.</p> <p>“We have things that have gone awry. It is no surprise at all that you're going to see an increase in union organizing and increase in interest and popularity,” she touted.</p> <p>But while Smith and Klobuchar were singing the praises unions, it was just this past August when the FBI raided the homes of United Auto Workers’ leadership as part of a corruption probe. NBC viewers didn’t learn about that story because they (along with ABC) refused to cover it.</p> <p>CBS correspondent Dean Reynolds noted at the time that the “FBI raids today on the homes of Gary Jones, the current president of the United Auto Workers; and Dennis Williams, his immediate predecessor…” Reynolds added that the raids “signaled a drastic escalation of a four-year probe into illegal payments to union officials.”</p> <p>Earlier Wednesday, CNBC reported online that UAW leaders were still being charged with corruption. ""Federal prosecutors have charged retired United Auto Workers Vice President Joseph Ashton, a former board member of General Motors, as part of its corruption probe into the union,"" Michael Wayland reported. ""Ashton was charged Wednesday in a criminal information filing, which indicates a guilty plea is expected.""</p> <p>A Democratic debate was coming up, but, as they would surely note for President Trump, they’re running to be president for ALL Americans. So, “What Matters” to Republican voters matters too. NBC just couldn’t care less.</p> <p>The transcript is below, click ""expand"" to read:</p>",1

978678539,Chad Elections - President Déby Seeks a Sixth Term in a Region for Old Men,2021-04-08 04:37:07,"<p>analysis</p> <p>Central Africa boasts many of the world's longest-standing authoritarian rulers. But protests are growing.</p> <p>In a familiar pattern than continues to be repeated, President Idriss Déby looks set to be elected for yet another term in Chad following this Sunday's presidential elections. In power since 1990, this will be the 68-year-old incumbent's sixth term.</p> <p>President Déby's victory at the ballot box may be all but assured, but that's not to say he doesn't face significant opposition. When he was nominated to be the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement's flagbearer this February, the announcement sparked widespread demonstrations. In the capital N'Djamena and other major cities, protesters took to the streets chanting ""no to a sixth term!"" and ""Leave, Déby!"".</p> <p>The government has responded with force. Authorities arrested hundreds of protesters. They charged several with assault and disturbing the public order. In anticipation of more street action, authorities also imposed a blanket ban on protests. Internet restrictions are expected to follow.</p> <p>This is all characteristic of Déby's repressive rule and management of the upcoming elections. For years, his government has overseen sustained attacks against human rights defenders, opposition politicians and journalists. One of Chad's most prominent human rights defender, Baradine Berdeï Targuio, has been detained since January 2020 charged with ""subversive activities on social media"". In November 2020, security forces surrounded the premises of several opposition parties and civil society groups, and raided private radio stations including Radio FM Liberté.</p> <p>Amid this increasingly unequal playing filed, Chad's main opposition leader, Saleh Kebzabo, quit the presidential race in early-March. His decision came shortly after two people were killed as security forces tried to arrest his fellow opposition leader Yaya Dillo.</p> <p>A regional problem</p> <p>Since he came to power via a coup in 1990, President Déby has won every election and amended the constitution twice to facilitate his stay in power. His 2005 constitutional revision removed the two-term limit. The 2018 amendments re-imposed it, but ensured it would not apply retroactively while also extending presidential mandates from five years to six. This means Déby could now stay in power until 2033.</p> <p>This determination to cling onto power, along with the brutal treatment of opponents, is consistent with the broader picture in Central Africa. Throughout this region, politics has been militarised and electoral periods are characterised by violence and instability. Authorities target anyone who speaks out - from human rights organisations and the political opposition to trade unions - and presidents maintain a tight grip on power.</p> <p>Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang and Cameroon's Paul Biya are two of the world's longest serving presidents, having been in office for 42 and 39 years respectively. The Republic of Congo's Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of Congo is referred to by some as an ""Emperor"", having ruled for 36 years over two periods. Gabon's Ali Bongo has been president for a comparatively brief 12 years but was preceded by his father who ruled for the 42 years before that.</p> <p>Along with undemocratic and repressive domestic policies, several Central African leaders' stays in power have been made possible by international complicity. Chad is a strategic US ally in the campaign against Islamist insurgencies in the Chad Basin. Cameroon, Congo and Gabon are among the last bastions of French influence in Francophone Africa. The Central African Republic has presented a useful opportunity for Russia to expand its international standing.</p> <p>These alliances of convenience have often provided authoritarian governments with crucial support and funding - some of which has financed security forces that then commit the same kinds of abuses as the groups they are meant to be targeting - while also shielding undemocratic leaders from international censure.</p> <p>Pushing back</p> <p>As seen in Chad, people across Central Africa are not staying silent. Civil society groups in the Congo and Cameroon, for example, are increasingly speaking out against state excesses and calling for political reforms, starting with free and fair elections and adherence to term limits. Despite the risks, protests against rising costs of living, increasing inequality and the monopolisation of power by ruling elites are growing. Repeats of Sudan's 2019 uprising, which ended Omar al-Bashir's three-decade reign, cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Chad Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

They should bolster groups that work on the ground to encourage people and governments to move towards democracy. At the same time, they should demand that foreign governments look beyond their own narrow strategic interests and recognise the impact of the militarisation of politics and the use of violence against civil society, the media and opposition.</p> <p>Without this support, local civil society will struggle to push back against authoritarian leaders. They need broader support as they attempt to prevent leaders like President Déby extending his undemocratic rule and, in the longer-term, resist the plans of ageing presidents to follow in Gabon's footsteps by converting their individual reign into dynastic rule, further extending the cycle of human rights violations and repression.</p> <p>David Kode is the Advocacy and Campaigns Lead at global civil society alliance CIVICUS.</p>",1
929393719,"Philippine journalist convicted of libel, given 6-year term",2020-06-14 00:00:00,"<p>MANILA, Philippines (AP) - An award-winning journalist critical of the Philippine president was convicted of libel and sentenced to jail Monday in a decision called a major blow to press freedom in an Asian bastion of democracy.</p> <p>The Manila court found Maria Ressa of the online news site Rappler Inc. and former reporter Reynaldo Santos Jr. guilty of libeling a wealthy businessman. The Rappler’s story on May 29, 2012, cited an intelligence report linking him to a murder, drug dealing, human trafficking and smuggling. The site’s lawyers disputed any malice and said the time limit for filing the libel complaint had passed.</p> <p>“Rappler and both accused did not offer a scintilla of proof that they verified the imputations of various crimes in the disputed article upon the person of Keng,” Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa said in the 36-page ruling. “They just simply published them as news in their online publication in reckless disregard of whether they are false or not.”</p> <p>“The decision for me is devastating because it essentially says that Rappler, that we are wrong,” Ressa said in a news conference after the ruling. Her voice cracking, she vowed that “we will keep fighting” and appealed to journalists and Filipinos to continue fighting for their rights “and hold power to account.”</p> <p>The businessman, Wilfredo Keng, welcomed the ruling, which he said vindicated him and cleared his name “which Ressa, with one click of a button, attempted to destroy.”</p> <p>Ressa was sentenced to up to six years but her lawyer, Theodore Te, said the jail terms and other penalties imposed could not be enforced unless all appeals were rejected. She posted bail for the case last year and will study possible appeals in the next 15 days, Te said.</p> <p>“The verdict against Maria Ressa highlights the ability of the Philippines’ abusive leader to manipulate the laws to go after critical, well-respected media voices whatever the ultimate cost to the country,” said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch, adding the verdict was “a frontal assault on freedom of the press that is critical to protect and preserve Philippines democracy.”</p> <p>President Rodrigo Duterte and other Philippine officials have said the criminal complaints against Ressa and Rappler were not a press freedom issue but a part of normal judicial procedures arising from their alleged violations of the law.</p> <p>Keng dismissed the allegations in the 2012 story as baseless and false and said Rappler refused to take down the story online and publish his side of the story. He provided government certifications in court to show that he has no criminal record and sought 50 million pesos ($1 million) in damages, but the court awarded a much smaller fine.</p> <p>Rappler’s lawyers said the story was based on an unspecified intelligence report and that Philippine penal law requires a libel complaint to be filed within one year. Keng filed his lawsuit in 2017, five years after the story was published.</p> <p>A cybercrime law, which the Rappler journalists allegedly violated, was also enacted in September 2012 or four months after the story written by Santos was published. Rappler’s lawyers said Philippine penal laws cannot be retroactively applied.</p> <p>Rappler, however, acknowledged that it updated the story in February 2014 to correct a misspelled word but said it did not make any other changes. The Department of Justice, which brought the libel charges to court, contended that by updating the story, Rappler effectively republished the story online in 2014, an argument dismissed by the news site’s lawyers.</p> <p>The Department of Justice argued a complaint can be filed under the 2012 cybercrime law for up to 12 years, countering Rappler’s argument that Keng’s complaint was invalid due to being outside the one-year deadline for libel.</p> <p>The Manila court upheld the 12-year period.</p> <p>As Rappler’s chief executive officer, Ressa faces seven other criminal complaints in relation to legal issues hounding her news agency, including an allegation that it violated a constitutional ban on media agencies receiving foreign investment funds.</p> <p>Ressa, who has worked for CNN and was one of Time magazine’s Persons of the Year in 2018, has accused the government of abusing its power and of using the law to muzzle dissent.</p> <p>Many news outlets in the Philippines and beyond have criticized Duterte’s policies, including his anti-drug campaign that has left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.</p> <p>Duterte has openly lambasted journalists and news sites who report critically about him, including the Philippine Daily Inquirer, a leading daily, and ABS-CBN, the country’s largest TV network which was shut down by the government’s telecommunications regulator last month after its 25-year franchise expired. Congress has been hearing the network’s request for a franchise renewal.</p> <p>The shutdown has been criticized as it cut off a major source of information on the COVID-19 pandemic in a Southeast Asian hot spot of the disease.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Associated Press journalist Kiko Rosario in Bangkok contributed to this report.</p>",1
1002138003,It’s Time To Reassess Our Relationship With Israel,2021-09-01 22:00:21,"<p>By</p> <p>In April 1996, Israeli artillery shells rained down on a United Nations compound where hundreds of civilians were taking refuge. As the shells exploded and the building collapsed, 106 civilians died and another 116 were injured.</p> <p>The attack, now known as the Qana Massacre, was part of a larger Israeli offensive known as Operation Grapes of Wrath, a 16-day campaign of aggression in southern Lebanon.</p> <p>The United Nations investigated the Qana Massacre and determined the Israeli shelling was deliberate. Then-UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghani condemned the attack, writing it was “all the more serious because civilians, including women and children, had sought refuge” in the compound the Israelis destroyed.</p> <p>The commander of the unit that launched the assault was a man named Naftali Bennett, who’d go on to boast, “I’ve killed lots of Arabs in my life and there’s no problem with that.”</p> <p>Bennett, of course, is now Israel’s prime minister. And on August 25, he arrived for a visit at the White House.</p> <p>When President Biden took office, he promised to pursue a foreign policy based on human rights and the “rules-based international order.”</p> <p>Those commitments already seemed at odds with the long-running U.S. support for Israel. Whether it’s giving Israel nearly $4 billion in military aid every year or providing diplomatic protection at the United Nations, the United States allows Israel to act with impunity even after repeated instances of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Don’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free</p> <p>But Biden’s promise to put human rights and international law first seem especially at odds with supporting a government like Bennett’s. Bennett’s war criminal past is troubling enough, but his current positions flout international law — and longstanding U.S. support for a two-state solution — just as aggressively.</p> <p>Bennett is an outspoken supporter of expanding illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and annexing occupied Palestinian land for Israel. “The [settlement] building momentum in the country must not be stopped, even for a second,” Bennett has said. He added, “We must give our lives” to annex the West Bank.</p> <p>Bennett has also insisted that he “categorically opposes a Palestinian state” and vowed, “I will do everything in my power to make sure that [the Palestinians] do not get a state.”</p> <p>Since assuming office, Naftali Bennett has overseen a broken ceasefire in Gaza, the intimidation and arrest of hundreds of activists (including journalists), and a fascist march through Jerusalem where individuals chanted “death to the Arabs” and “your religion is rubbish.”</p> <p>Although many in the U.S. may hope that Bennett will turn over a new page after the divisive rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, the truth is that he’s more like a photocopy.</p> <p>If anything, the policies and rhetoric coming from Israel’s far right are more extreme than ever. Shortly before his White House visit, Bennett told the New York Times there would be no peace agreement with the Palestinians under his watch.</p> <p>President Biden has time and time again stated that “America is back.” But if Biden actually wants to put human rights and the “rules-based order” back in U.S. foreign policy, then we can’t just “go back” to the same old playbook of supporting Israeli governments no matter what they do.</p> <p>America simply cannot be “back” — it has to be better, and adhering to a status quo relationship with Israel is not that.

942954258,Failed Toronto condo project lays bare battle between wealthy foreign investors,2020-08-26 08:00:00-04:00,"<p>1001 Broadview Ave., Toronto, site of the former Whistler's Grille and Cafe Bar, since demolished.D'Arcy McGovern/The Globe and Mail</p> <p>A failed condominium development project in Toronto’s east end has laid bare a multimillion-dollar dispute between the sons of a former banker who fled charges of embezzlement and fraud in Iran and a family of Saudi Arabian investors.</p> <p>At the centre of the insolvency proceedings for 1001 Broadview Avenue Inc., initiated in early 2020 by private lender Centurion Mortgage Capital Corporation, is restaurant investor Khashayar Khavari. The report from receiver BDO describes a series high-interest loans and a string of missed payments connected to a land-assembly deal in 2017 by Mr. Khavari and his brother Ardavan for a site at the corner of Mortimer and Broadview Avenues in Toronto’s East York neighbourhood.</p> <p>Centurion is the first-ranking lender on the file and is owed $8,067,628 after agreeing to lend $44-million for construction of a seven-storey condominium building. Despite receiving planning permission for the condo, almost no work has been done aside from the demolition of a popular local eatery and banquet hall known as Whistler’s Grille and Café Bar that formerly anchored the site.</p> <p>“What this community has ended up with is an empty lot full of grass, weeds and garbage, while these millionaires are fighting,” said Councillor Paula Fletcher, who voted with Toronto council to approve the project’s rezoning. “It should never have happened,” she said. “What the hell are these big money investors doing at this little corner in East York?” The company also owes $146,291 in unpaid property taxes to the City of Toronto.</p> <p>Some explanation about what went wrong can be found in a set of affidavits connected to a second unsecured mortgage on the property held by a company called 1001 Broadview Investment Inc. The investors in that company include a high-net-worth family from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia led by Amr Abdulwahab Attar, who brought an unsuccessful insolvency application for the property in 2019.</p> <p>Mr. Attar’s affidavit provides an intimate look at how wealthy foreign investors came to participate in an investment in Canada’s real estate market. He describes meeting Michael Decauni, an executive at the small Canadian investment company Callian Capital Partners Inc. (of which the Khavari brothers were equity partners), in Geneva, Switzerland in 2015 that led to an investing relationship. “For the past few years, my family and I have been interested in investing in the North American real estate market, and possibly immigrating to Canada. In June of 2017, Decauni told me that he and his partners, Khash, Ardavan Khavari and Khalid Khashoggi (”Khalid”), had placed a deposit on [1001 Broadview] using $2.1-million of their own money, and a further US$10-million was required to purchase the land.”</p> <p>Mr. Attar said he had turned down an offer to get an 18-per-cent return on a $3-million investment when the condo project was complete, but he agreed to invest if his money would get a 15-per-cent return, paid semi-annually, after being promised his investment would be safe in the event of an insolvency. “Decauni informed me that, more likely than not, the land would be sold at a premium of no less than 25 per cent within the first year, and the Project would not be developed,” Mr. Attar said. In August, 2017, Mr. Attar, his father and sister each pledged $1-million to the project, and in November his mother and a cousin named Walid added another $5-million (the Walid investment would be structured to be compliant with Sharia law). Mr. Attar himself subsequently joined Callian Capital as an executive.</p> <p>In 2018, the Attar family members received their scheduled returns: US$75,000 twice that year as the project continued (except for Walid who’s $4-million contribution earned him US$300,000 payments). But in November, 2018, the payments were delayed until January, 2019, after which no further payments were made.</p> <p>In a responding affidavit Mr. Khavari agrees with most of those events, but he and Mr. Attar disagree as to why the payments stopped. Mr. Khavari alleges demands from Mr. Attar for extra payments for financing fees and legal fees drained the project’s budget, while Mr. Attar points the finger back at Mr. Khavari and his brother alleging instances of improper invoices. The affidavits also show that the $2.1-million the Khavari’s pledged to the project as equity was actually a high-interest loan from a third party, and funds were also taken out of the project budget to repay that loan.</p> <p>None of the allegations have been tested in court.</p> <p>Ultimately, the application to appoint a receiver by Mr. Attar was postponed and his family syndicate must now wait for Centurion’s loan to be paid back through the sale of the land before applying to receive any remaining funds.</p> <p>Missing from the Attar and Centurion filings is some context for the Khavari family. Khashayar Khavari is the son of Mahmoud Reza Khavari, who in 2011 resigned his job as managing director of Iran’s state-owned Melli Bank and fled to Canada amid allegations of embezzlement and financial fraud. Iran accuses the elder Mr. Khavari – a dual citizen of Iran and Canada – of helping embezzle US$2.6-billion out of the country. In 2014, billionaire businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi was executed in Iran for his role in the scheme. In 2017, according to Iranian state media, Mr. Khavari was convicted in absentia by an Iranian court and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Bank Melli and another bank Mr. Khavari led have been accused by the EU and U.S. of laundering funds intended to finance international terrorism and support Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. The allegations have not been tested in a Canadian court, and while Iran has demanded Mr. Khavari’s return Canada has no bi-lateral extradition treaty with the Islamic republic. There is no indication that Mahmoud Reza Khavari is himself involved in the Broadview project.</p> <p>It’s not the first time the family has been involved in court actions in this country. In 2016, details about the Khavari family’s business dealings in Canada came to light in lawsuits between them and Sam Mizrahi, a Toronto real estate developer constructing Canada’s tallest residential building at 1 Bloor St. Mr. Mizrahi’s testimony in those cases described feeling pressured to conceal the Khavari connection to two luxury condo projects on claims that the family’s bank accounts in Canada had been frozen following the embezzlement allegations, Mr. Mizrahi also alleged that he was later threatened with financial and reputational ruin by the Khavari brothers.</p> <p>The court ruled in Mr. Mizrahi’s favour, denying the Khavaris the $35-million they were seeking. Despite the public and acrimonious dispute, Khashayar Khavari continues to tout the connection, describing Mr. Mizrahi as a former “general contractor” on the website for his H&CO Developments website.</p> <p>Mr. Khavari and Mr. Attar did not respond to requests for comment from The Globe and Mail; Dominique Michaud, a partner with Robins Appleby LLP who is representing Centurion said his clients declined to comment on the decision to lend money to Mr. Khavari.</p> <p>Your house is your most valuable asset.

1038658425,"Morrison points to economy, Albanese wants change, as voters leave Coalition in Qld and WA",2022-04-10 00:00:00,"<p>“Fear can be a powerful emotion and there will be a bit of that over the next six weeks, I expect, but I want to appeal to Australians’ sense of optimism and hope for a better future,” he said. “I won’t go missing when the going gets tough.” Mr Morrison launched the campaign after flying from Sydney to Canberra on Sunday morning to visit Governor-General David Hurley at Government House in Yarralumla to ask him to dissolve Parliament and set May 21 as the date for Australians to cast their ballots. The government strategy takes the election to the last possible day for votes to be cast in a standard half-Senate election on a Saturday, maximising the length of the formal campaign in the hope Mr Albanese will crumble under pressure.</p> <p>“It is a choice between a strong economy and a Labor opposition that would weaken it,” Mr Morrison said. Loading His advisers have been frustrated for months at what they regard as a lack of scrutiny of Mr Albanese and his policies, but their attempts to shine a spotlight on the Labor leader have been undone by the disunity within the Liberals including attacks on the Prime Minister’s character. The government’s challenges were highlighted on Sunday when Mr Morrison was asked about the status of former education minister Alan Tudge, who stood aside earlier this year over questions about his relationship with a former press secretary, Rachelle Miller. Asked if Mr Tudge would be restored to federal cabinet, Mr Morrison responded by saying “Alan Tudge is still in my cabinet” and countering the assumption the minister had been sidelined.</p> <p>The Prime Minister is preparing to name a new minister to the health portfolio this week so Australians will know who would take over the post from Health Minister Greg Hunt, who is leaving Parliament at this election. Asked about his own intentions, Mr Morrison confirmed he would serve the full term of Parliament if the government were returned. On his policies, he emphasised the tax relief offered in the federal budget as well as benefits for small business owners while pointing to the unemployment rate – forecast to be 3.75 per cent later this year, the lowest in 48 years – as proof of results. He named government spending on roads, railways, renewable energy and new dams as key priorities as well as the “biggest rebuilding” of the Australian Defence Force since World War II.</p> <p>“It’s a choice between a strong and tested government team that has demonstrated our ability to make difficult and tough choices in tough times and a Labor opposition who has been so focused on politics over these past few years that they still can’t tell you what they’d do, who they are, or what they believe in and what they stand for,” he said. Loading “It’s a choice between a government you know and a Labor opposition that you don’t.” Mr Albanese bristled at questions on Sunday that suggested he had not unveiled enough of his policies, pointing to the climate change policy he outlined last December with estimates it would support 604,000 jobs by 2030. The policy requires spending $24 billion on new infrastructure while capping greenhouse gas emissions at large enterprises. Mr Albanese sought to remind voters of Mr Morrison’s attack on Labor at the previous election for setting a target to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles.</p> <p>“If you fear the present you have no chance of shaping the future,” he said. Assuring voters he had an agenda for the next term of Parliament, Mr Albanese listed policies such as a $2.5 billion aged care plan to hire more nurses and lift standards, a childcare policy to increase rebates for families, a national integrity commission with stronger powers than the government’s model, a $10 billion fund to invest in affordable housing and a reconstruction fund for manufacturing. He emphasised industrial relations as a field where Labor would act in government to encourage the Fair Work Commission to set higher pay rates. “We will have a policy of lifting people’s wages through the changes that we announced almost two years ago for industrial relations,” he said, “making sure that secure work is an objective in the Fair Work Act, properly defining casualisation, having same job, same pay, making wage theft a crime, closing the gender pay gap. “We have outlined a series of policies for the election. Mr Morrison has not outlined any agenda for another term.”</p> <p>The campaign has already been under way before its official announcement. Both leaders have been crossing the country over the past week. Mr Morrison has visited the Labor seats of Corio and McEwen in Victoria, both just outside Melbourne, as well as Lyons in Tasmania, Parramatta in western Sydney and Dobell on the central coast of NSW. His regional visit in NSW also took in three Labor seats in the Hunter Valley – Hunter, Shortland and Paterson – but was overshadowed by strong criticism from a disability support pensioner during a visit to a tavern outside Newcastle. Loading Mr Morrison also held media events over the past week in Liberal electorates including Chisholm in Melbourne – the government’s most marginal seat – as well as Bass in Tasmania, Banks in southern Sydney and Robertson on the central coast of NSW. Mr Albanese has made several visits to the South Australian seat of Boothby, which is held by the Liberals but is the Labor Party’s key target in that state, as well as holding media events in Reid in western Sydney, Hasluck in Perth (held by Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt) and the northern Brisbane seats of Longman and Dickson (held by Defence Minister Peter Dutton).</p>",1
870478161,China’s False War on Corruption,2019-09-04 19:10:19,"<p>In 2013, China’s president, Xi Jinping, announced his goal to fight both “tigers” and “flies,” references to both top-ranking officials and ordinary bureaucrats. At the time, the announcement indicated hope that China could create a clean government—free of bribery, crime, and other corruption endemic to the state—like those of Hong Kong or Singapore. Over five years later, however, China’s anticorruption campaign has fallen short, with no meaningful political reform in place and no long-term legal framework introduced to prevent corruption.</p> <p>In the meantime, Xi has continued to concentrate his power, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Chinese history. China’s emerging civil society of NGOs, community groups, and social-advocacy organizations, which prospered under economic reform and modernization over the past three decades, now faces increasing government scrutiny. Dissent has been suppressed, making it harder for Chinese people to protest.</p> <p>I travelled throughout China as a reporter in 2012, the same year Xi launched his worldwide anti-graft campaign, presumably to cut down on political and private influence over public projects. Very often, I would hear ordinary Chinese citizens express their discontent with the one-party government and corrupt officials. “The country is dying from corruption and the widening wealth gap,” a taxi driver who gave me a ride in Chongqing said, something echoed by Xi himself, who said, “We must . . . rid ourselves of any virus that erodes the party’s health.”</p> <p>For some in China, 2012 was a year of prosperity; for others, the wealth gap only widened. After over three decades of economic and social reforms, China’s gross domestic product reached about $8.5 trillion (US), according to the World Bank, making it the second largest GDP in the world. However, its income inequality was also among the world’s worst. A 2015 report found the wealthiest 1 percent of Chinese households owned a third of the country’s wealth, while the poorest quarter owned just 1 percent. China’s Gini coefficient, a widely used measure of income inequality, was 0.422 in 2012, according to the World Bank. A coefficient above 0.4 is generally considered a warning sign of income inequality.</p> <p>Many people were unhappy about the disparity. The media reported 382 worker strikes in China in 2012, according to data from Hong Kong–based NGO China Labour Bulletin. Many of them were protesting arrears of wages and long working hours. But these issues were only the tip of the iceberg. In time, Chinese citizens held hundreds of protests objecting to issues such as the polluted environment, rising house prices, lack of food safety, and political suffocation—most of which have their roots in corruption. Then, Xi replaced Hu Jintao as president.</p> <p>In contrast to his predecessor, Xi came from a prominent political family. He was a “princeling”—the descendant of a powerful Communist Party figure, Xi Zhongxun, who later became a vice-premier. Xi followed in his father’s footsteps, and his steady rise to power was possibly helped by his connection to other princelings and their families, who hold key roles in government departments, state enterprises, and financial institutions. Being a princeling may have also enabled Xi to take extreme reform measures within the party and launch his so-called war on corruption.</p> <p>To understand how corruption works in China, one needs to understand its politics and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). China became a one-party country ruled by the CCP in 1949. A seven-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), whose members also hold senior posts in other top leadership bodies, is the most powerful decision-making body in the party. One member of the PSC is the secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party’s top anti-graft body and one of the most feared institutions in the country. But the nature of the CCDI has made it, too, potentially susceptible to corruption.</p> <p>For example, the CCDI is responsible for enforcing Xi’s campaign to sanction officials for “serious violations of party discipline,” a subtle Chinese phrase referring to acts of corruption. The CCDI oversees a group of lower-level disciplinary officials. Cases brought forward by the CCDI are rarely overruled by the judicial system, which is not independent from the government administration in China.</p> <p>The CCDI recently announced that, in 2017, 527,000 people were given discipline violations ranging from warnings and demotions to expulsion from the CCP and removal from office. “Among them,” reports The Diplomat, a current-affairs magazine for the Asia-Pacific region, “58 were officials at the provincial and ministerial level or higher. The CCDI also revealed that about 48,000 officials were investigated or prosecuted for severe violations of discipline and suspected criminal activity.”</p> <p>However, the procedure for investigating a suspected corrupt official is neither standard nor transparent. Officials from the secretive, powerful agency have the ultimate authority to decide who should be targeted and undergo investigation. They can imprison suspected officials for months without a warrant and question them with evidence seized from beatings, sleep deprivation, or anonymous tips. The primary job of the agency is inspections.</p> <p>Teams from the CCDI conduct surprise inspections of provincial departments and state-owned enterprises. They often work out of makeshift offices at local hotels for months, where they meet with dozens of low- and mid-level officials who have been targeted.</p> <p>There is an old saying: absolute power corrupts absolutely. The CCDI has grown into the country’s most powerful institution by enforcing Xi’s anticorruption campaign. It became so omnipotent that the CCP decided investigators needed to be reined in and face “higher self-discipline.” “A total of 22 officials with the [CCDI] . . . have been investigated, and about 230 officials have received written or oral warnings since the 18th CCP National Congress in late 2012,” China’s state media Xinhua reported in 2018. “During the same period,” the Xinhua article added, “more than 10,000 officials serving at various levels in Discipline Inspection agencies were punished.”</p> <p>One consistent paradox in modern Chinese history is that worsening corruption has not seemed to slow China’s economic growth—at least not yet.</p> <p>The People’s Republic of China was founded, in 1949, on the nationalization of land and resources by dividing the farmland of local tyrants (da tuhao, fen tiandi). In the late 1970s, when the Chinese government began to liberalize its economic policies, which allowed individuals to own businesses, the scale of corruption increased dramatically—the liberalization policy enabled government officials to cash in on their ability to manipulate the allocation of national resources of land and capital.</p> <p>At its core, corruption in China revolves around the concept of guanxi, which roughly translates to “relationships” or “connections.” Guanxi is a Chinese practice of cultivating personal relations with influential people—the term itself doesn’t always indicate corrupt behaviour. Today, individuals seek favours from bureaucrats and officials to allow them to slip through the back door (zou houmen) to obtain state resources, government projects, green lights to pollute, admissions to elite schools, or jobs in government departments. The effects of guanxi on corrupt dealings is perpetuated by a lack of law, regulations, and transparency.</p> <p>Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping famously described economic reform as “crossing the river by feeling stones” (mo zhe shi tou guo he), to show that reform policies were adaptable and flexible. Those flexible policies also left room for corruption to flourish and evolve. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chinese corruption was very different from what it has become. Corrupt officials mostly worked alone. But, by 1995, corruption became organized. Officials in one department or even one region began to form close networks and work cooperatively. (The Guangdong Maoming case, in 2012, is a classic example: according to reports from the South China Morning Post, a single corruption case in the city of Maoming involved more than 300 officials taking bribes for favours.)</p> <p>Corruption in China has now evolved from organized corruption to institutionalized corruption. Throughout the late 1990s, governments began to incorporate corruption into their official policies and institutions. Today, corruption has become so rampant that an official charged with taking thousands of yuan is regarded as a reasonable official who may be considered someone who at least does not take too many bribes. In 1994, 1,915 high-level officials were charged with corruption, and the total amount of money involved in these cases totalled 3.4 billion yuan (over $629 million). In 2007, the number of high-level officials prosecuted had jumped to 2,706, and the assets involved had roughly doubled to 6.7 billion yuan (over $1.24 billion).</p> <p>Despite the government’s ongoing anticorruption campaign, old habits die hard. Xi has a trusted circle of friends who are relatively safe from investigations. The penalty for bribery under Chinese law ranges from fines to the confiscation of property to imprisonment to, in some cases, the death penalty. Yet public officials, corporate executives, and others who offer bribes often escape punishment altogether.</p> <p>Soon after Xi started his anticorruption policies in 2012, he ordered a series of crackdowns on China’s growing civil society. The CCP has put human rights lawyers in jail, suppressed internet freedom, closed unauthorized churches, arrested outspoken labour activists, and integrated party organizations into enterprises and universities. The government has also begun to establish an Orwellian “social credit” system, where individuals relinquish their privacy through increased government surveillance in the name of national security. These crackdowns have severely damaged civil society in China.</p> <p>The Chinese government has also restricted the media’s right to report on critical issues across the country. An unofficial rule that allowed journalists to expose corrupt officials in provinces other than where the media organization was based has been abolished under Xi’s administration. It was replaced with stricter media regulations and more severe censorship, making it difficult for civil society to monitor or expose corruption. Many journalists, bloggers, and human rights activists were arrested and forced to confess without a fair trial or any due process. According to Reporters Without Borders, more than 100 journalists and bloggers are currently being detained.</p> <p>In 2018, China entered the sixth year of its anticorruption drive. According to the CCDI itself, authorities have registered about 1.16 million corruption cases, and 1.14 million officials at or below township level have been punished since the 18th National Congress in 2012. At least 240 senior officials have also been investigated. After a three-day closed-door meeting on of the CCDI in early January 2018, it identified the banking industry as a critical area of corruption, foreshadowing future anticorruption storms in the financial sector. It is standard practice for state leaders and their princeling children to hire princelings to secure financial deals and build relationships with powerful families.</p> <p>During a critical meeting last year, Xi called for more anticorruption efforts to “fundamentally improve the political ecosystem of the [CCP].” So far, regardless of worthwhile questions about its political motivations and sincerity, the anticorruption campaign has strengthened Xi’s power. But, if it is to become a lasting political legacy, more needs to be done from the government’s side. China needs to institutionalize the anticorruption drive and reform the legal framework so there is an enduring system in place to consistently prevent corruption going forward.</p> <p>Seven years into its official fight against corruption, Chinese officials are only just becoming cautious about bribe-taking. Instead of being open about it, they now do it less visibly. Corrupt officials used to spend large amounts of money in high-end restaurants and hotels, but officials are much more discreet now. As Xi famously declared when he first came to power, “[We] dare not, cannot, and do not want to be corrupt.” It remains to be seen, however, whether this mantra will ring true.</p> <p>Echo Hui Echo Hui is a reporter for the South China Morning Post.
