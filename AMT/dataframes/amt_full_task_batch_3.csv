970247117,"NUT alleges fresh plots to destabilise primary, secondary education | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News",2021-02-18 04:06:44,"<p>There are fresh plots to destabilise the education system at the primary and secondary school levels, the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) has alleged.</p> <p>The National President of the union, Dr. Nasir Idris, who stated this in Abuja, recently, alleged that some influential Nigerians at the state level are backing the non-registered Academic Staff Union of Secondary Schools (ASUSS) to destabilise the operations of NUT which could lead to the disruption of academic activities at the lower level of learning.</p> <p>Idris, who was represented by the Deputy President of NUT, Kelvin Nwankwo, cautioned that the latest antics by ASUSS to rely on a purported judgement that granted the unregistered group a union status is not only misleading, but mischievous.</p> <p>He said registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and collecting levies from unsuspecting teachers do not confer unionism status on the group, saying the unregistered group cannot negotiate collective bargaining agreement with any employer.</p> <p>He explained that only the Registrar of Trade Union can duly register a group of workers as union in the country, saying adopting any other means to register ASUSS as a trade union will run contrary to the tenet of Labour laws which abhor registration of another union in the same sector where one already exists.</p> <p>He hinted that in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court, NUT is awaiting the transmission of the matter to the Court of Appeal for the rehearing on jurisdiction of the Federal High Court.</p> <p>“The group of secondary school teachers led by Mr. Samuel Omaji making a hollow, deceptive and false claim to have obtained judgment to unionise secondary school teachers is reckless, complete falsehood and extraneous to the decisions of the Supreme Court, as well as and other relevant Labour Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” Idris stated.</p> <p>Citing a letter by the Minister of Labour and Productivity with ref No. ML. IB/147/5.1/188 dated May 18, 2012, NUT noted a trade union or association, which has not been finally registered and certified by the registrar of trade union even though it might have concluded most of the process required to obtain registration, hold no claim of being a union.</p> <p>The union held that the extant provision of the Third Schedule Part A No. 26 of the Trade Unions Act CAP.T.14 LFN 2004 which provides: Nigeria Union of Teachers shall exercise jurisdiction over: “Teachers employed in educational institutions of all types, but excluding Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education and other tertiary institutions.” as severally established by the Registrar of Trade Unions, that Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) is the body that is statutorily registered to organize teachers in primary and secondary schools in Nigeria.</p> <p>Indeed, with the provision of the Trade Union Act, NUT called on all teachers of secondary schools in Nigeria to disregard the baseless claim by ASUSS as no such matter of membership of Secondary School Teachers was before the Supreme court and the Status of NUT in unionising teachers of primary and secondary schools remains sacrosanct and backed by the Jurisdictional Scope of trade unions as contained in the Trade Union Act CAP T.14 LFN 2004 cited above.</p> <p>Idris maintained that the leadership of NUT has always rotated between primary and secondary school teachers where no one can claim marginalisation of any sort.</p> <p>His words: “The NUT will clock ninety (90) years of Trade Union practice by July 2021. The leaders in the spirit of leadership have been mutually rotating her apex leadership’s position between the Secondary and Primary Schools teachers.</p> <p>This notwithstanding, record has it that out of fifteen (15) presidents of our great Union, only two had been selected from the Primary School arm, while the others were drawn from Secondary Schools arm. The NUT is enjoying a robust spirit of comradeship where we peruse the welfare of our members and better conditions of service, but not which arm of the teaching industry do you belong.”</p> <p>He further alleged that the latest agitation by ASUSS is a ploy to weaken the operations of the NUT, which will be resisted by the members.</p>",3
980400116,Homage paid to I.A. Rehman at online reference,2021-04-18 06:56:01,"<p>KARACHI: The Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) on Saturday evening held an online reference to pay homage to journalist and human rights defender I.A. Rehman, who passed away in Lahore on April 12.</p> <p>The first speaker was architect Arif Hasan. He divided his talk into three parts: his relationship with Rehman sahib, his personality and legacy. He said he met the late journalist and activist in Lahore in 1967 for the first time where he (Hasan) had gone to work. Although Rehman sahib was 12 or 13 years older than him, they would meet every evening where they’d be joined by the likes of Dr Mehdi Hasan and Nisar Osmani. Rehman sahib used to call the architect ‘kitab’. Even after he returned to Karachi from Lahore, both kept meeting on a regular basis. Their relationship deepened when Bangladesh was trying to gain independence. Their ties further strengthened during Z.A. Bhutto and Gen Ziaul Haq’s tenures.</p> <p>On the second point, Mr Hasan said Rehman sahib was a good listener. He knew how to lend an ear to people. He would never interrupt anyone while they were talking, even when they would be presenting a point of view opposite to his. He never spoke ill of anyone. At meetings and seminars, he would give an opinion that differed from others’ with a sense of humour. He never spoke about himself. Once, he visited his birthplace in Gurgaon, India. When he came back, nobody could detect an air of nostalgia in his narration about his place of birth. He talked about it like a tourist would. He was an extremely well-informed man who turned his wealth of information into knowledge (ilm).</p> <p>Mr Hasan, speaking about his legacy, said Rehman sahib has left behind the institutions that he was associated with and founded; his efforts to bring peace between India and Pakistan; his resolve that we should not be afraid of speaking the truth; and the youngsters who in their small but significant ways have established human rights and social welfare groups.</p> <p>‘He was a good listener, and never spoke ill of anyone’</p> <p>Executive director of PILER Karamat Ali said he had worked with Rehman sahib as a trade unionist and human rights activist. He had known him since 1971 when he visited Lahore with Sadequain. Rehman sahib at the time was looking after a newspaper, Azad. He (Ali) was deeply impressed with him from day one. After that he got to work with him at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and alongside him on projects that aimed to bring India and Pakistan closer. Whichever country he visited, it seemed as if it was his own because people there would greet him with a great deal of warmth.</p> <p>Mr Ali said Rehman sahib was like a father to him. On April 12, when he passed away, he (Ali) felt like an orphan. Speaking with him used to put him at peace. The late activist respected everyone’s point of view.</p> <p>Resident director Sindh, Aurat Foundation, Mahnaz Rahman said on April 12 she was at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) where an event was being held to mark the first death anniversary of journalist Ahfazur Rahman. There, the participants were in shock to receive the news of Rehman sahib’s passing. In September last year, when a condolence reference was held for Ahfazur Rahman at the Arts Council, Rehman sahib came from Lahore and delivered the keynote address.</p> <p>She said the news of Rehman sahib’s death flooded social media with messages. She mentioned two of them. One was from an admirer of Rehman sahib who wrote that he’s the ‘father of human rights’. The second was from a woman activist who said that women always felt comfortable working alongside Rehman sahib because he understood women’s issues. In that regard, she read out excerpts from an article by Rehman sahib which he wrote in favour of Aurat March.</p> <p>Earlier, chairperson of PIIA Masuma Hasan introduced the speakers to the online audience. She also briefly talked about Rehman sahib, calling him the leading public intellectual of Pakistan.</p> <p>Published in Dawn, April 18th, 2021</p>",3

Picture: Unison - Credit: Unison</p> <p>Details emerged during an online rally by the Unison trade union which has been staging pickets outside six council centres in its long-running dispute over controversial employment contracts that have been brought in from today.</p> <p>Police were called at the Blackwall transport depot in Silvoxcea Way, near the Blackwall Tunnel, where two protesters who were not union members had joined the picket.</p> <p>They were deemed “secondary pickets” and were taken away for obstruction in the cul de sac leading to the depot.</p> <p>“It’s a day of shame, police arresting two people who came to support us,” the union’s chief Tower Hamlets negotiator John McGloughlin told today’s rally. “They were told it was unlawful to picket as they didn’t work at the depot. Thatcher tactics are being used against us — and of all times during the pandemic.”</p> <p>On the picket line... outside Tower Hamlets council offices - Credit: Archant</p> <p>The union claiming the new contracts shrink income with travel and other allowances stopped and severance pay cut by 80pc, as well as “reduce flexible working and adversely affect other entitlements”.</p> <p>Council staff have supported the community during the Covid-19 emergency. Now the union says they are being “thanked” with the sack during the pandemic in order to be re-employed on the new contracts.</p> <p>The two who were arrested “were just coming to show their support”, the rally heard.</p> <p>The mayor said after the first strike day on Friday that the council had worked for the past 18 months to seek “collective agreement on changes” to the pay and conditions contracts. But talks broke down at Acas, the conciliation service. Around 1,300 staff had now opted for the new contract, which the mayor pointed out was “far more than voted for this strike”.</p> <p>Picket in Roman Road outside council housing office. Picture: Unison - Credit: Unison</p> <p>Unison accuses the town hall of being “insensitive” sacking staff during the Covid emergency in order to re-employ them on new contracts.</p> <p>The council accused the pickets of blocking the road and preventing access.</p> <p>A town hall spokesman said: “A picket on Friday outside our Blackwall depot extended into the road and vehicles were unable to get out. We respect the right of unions to picket, but not blocking roads and preventing access to property.”</p> <p>It affected bin collections and children with additional needs who couldn’t be collected for school because bus transport couldn’t reach them, the council pointed out.</p> <p>300 join trade union's online rally in dispute with Tower Hamlets Council - Credit: Archant</p> <p>“The police were called on that occasion,” the spokesman added. “The obstruction was cleared without the need for any arrests.”</p> <p>A similar incident took place today outside the depot when police were called again and arrests were made.</p> <p>Refuse workers from another union refused to cross Unison’s picket line on Friday. Their jobs have recently been taken over “in house” by the council which has ended using contractors for refuse collections. The refuse workers fear what the council is doing with 4,000 staff contracts today could soon be done to their working terms and conditions.</p> <p>Pickets were staged outside the town hall at Mulberry Place in Blackwall, the Poplar and Whitechapel Idea stores, Albert Jacobs housing offices at Roman Road in Bethnal Green, the car pound at Commercial Road in Limehouse and the Blackwall transport depot, as well as outside Mile End Hospital in a joint protest with NHS workers. Further pickets are planned from 5am tomorrow.</p>",3

Seventy workers were arrested and loaded onto two prisoner trucks.</p> <p>Union leaders say the police and military violence against protesters in the industrial zones is much worse than is being reported because nationwide internet service repeatedly has been cut, including on Sunday before a violent crackdown.</p> <p>Also this week, one union leader from the Federation of General Workers Myanmar (FGWM) was arrested while walking to the FGWM office but was released later that night.</p> <p>WORKERS TARGETED FOR STANDING UP FOR DEMOCRACY</p> <p>Workers, especially women, have taken a leading role in the civil disobedience movement (CDM) that began February 1, following the military ouster of elected officials, including leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

He did not say why he is being held.</p> <p>The family has demanded to know where he is, why he is being held, how they can orchestrate his release and get him a lawyer or legal advice.</p> <p>“Whilst it is wonderful to have heard from Malcolm, and to know he is all right, there is further work to do relating to the above outstanding issues,” said Maggie Turner, mother of Malcolm who lives in Jersey, British Islands.</p> <p>On Friday, the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) joined other organizations in requesting to be furnished about Malcom’s whereabouts.</p> <p>“Bidali is an activist and blogger whose articles have offered deep insight into the working and living conditions of migrant workers in Qatar,” KHRC said.</p> <p>“He has been on the front line fighting to reform Qatar’s labour laws by sharing his own experiences as a migrant worker in the country.”</p> <p>It added that the issues that he has been raising through social media are in the public domain, so it is preposterous for the authorities to pick on him.</p> <p>His articles provide a close look at the working and living conditions of some Gulf state low-wage migrants.</p> <p>He spoke about overcrowded dorms, seized passports, a lack of privacy, and his failed attempts to get better care.</p> <p>Malcolm had spoken to a coalition of civil society organizations and trade unions a few days before his arrest about his life in Qatar.</p> <p>“Days before his arrest and detention, he had spoken to various civil society organisations about the poor working and living conditions of migrant workers.

939839460,"Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested under security law, bearing out 'worst fears'",2020-08-10 00:23:00,"<p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai became the highest-profile person arrested under a new national security law on Monday, detained over suspected collusion with foreign forces as around 200 police searched the offices of his Apple Daily newspaper.</p> <p>Mainland-born Lai, who was smuggled into the British colony of Hong Kong on a fishing boat when he was a penniless 12-year-old, has been one of the most prominent democracy activists in the now Chinese-ruled city and an ardent critic of Beijing.</p> <p>His arrest comes amid Beijing’s crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in the city and further stokes concerns about media and other promised freedoms when it returned to China in 1997. China imposed the sweeping new security law on Hong Kong on June 30, drawing condemnation from Western countries.</p> <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was “deeply troubled” by reports of the arrest, calling it further proof that the Chinese Communist Party had “eviscerated” Hong Kong’s freedoms and eroded the rights of its people.</p> <p>The arrest “bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong’s national security law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom”, said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Asia programme coordinator.</p> <p>Ryan Law, chief editor of Apple Daily, a staunch anti-government tabloid that also does investigative work, told Reuters the paper would not be intimidated.</p> <p>“Business as usual,” he said.</p> <p>The security law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. Critics say it crushes freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year.</p> <p>Beijing said it supported Lai’s arrest.</p> <p>A spokesman for China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office told the official Xinhua news agency Lai was a representative of people who were “anti-China, anti-Hong Kong” and that he planned and instigated “illegal” protests, funded pro-independence forces and used his media group to spread rumours.</p> <p>Lai, 71, had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a “traitor”.</p> <p>Hong Kong police said they had arrested nine men and one woman, aged between 23 and 72, without naming them, adding that further arrests were possible.</p> <p>Suspected offences included “collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud” and others, the police said.</p> <p>Apple Daily posted on its Facebook page a livestream of police officers roaming through its newsroom and rifling through files, and asking staff for identity documents.</p> <p>Some executive offices were sealed off with red cordons. The police later wheeled in stacks of empty plastic containers. Lai himself was brought back to the office, initially in handcuffs.</p> <p>“We can’t worry that much, we can only go with the flow,” Lai said, before being escorted into a police vehicle.</p> <p>Police said around 200 officers entered the premises with a court warrant and collected 25 boxes of evidence after finishing the search. The law allows police to search premises without one “under exceptional circumstances”.</p> <p>Slideshow ( 5 images )</p> <p>In major cases in Hong Kong, the central government in Beijing can claim jurisdiction. The legislation allows agents to take suspects across the border for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts.</p> <p>Apple Daily reported that one of Lai’s sons, Ian, had also been arrested at his home and later showed his restaurant, Cafe Seasons, being raided by police.</p> <p>Shares in Lai's media company Next Digital 0282.HK, which publishes Apple Daily, plunged 16.7% before rebounding to trade 344% higher at one point as online pro-democracy forums called on investors to buy shares to show support.</p> <p>‘THIRD-WORLD’</p> <p>Slideshow ( 5 images )</p> <p>Other senior Apple Daily staff, including Executive Director Cheung Kim-hung, were also arrested.</p> <p>“We see this as straight harassment,” an Apple Daily source said, adding that Lai was arrested on suspicion of sedition, criminal fraud and colluding with foreign forces.</p> <p>Next Media Trade Union called the search “an extremely rare and serious incident in Hong Kong history”, with a “catastrophic” impact. It said journalists “will continue to guard their posts until the last minute”.</p> <p>Britain said the arrest was further evidence the security law was “a pretext to silence opposition”.</p> <p>Hong Kong Journalists Association chairman Chris Yeung said the search was akin to “third-world” press freedom suppression.</p> <p>Apple Daily executive Chan Pui-man said the newspaper will be published on Tuesday.</p> <p>“Even if Apple Daily publish a pile of blank paper tomorrow, we would go and buy a copy,” prominent young activist Joshua Wong said on Twitter.</p> <p>Wong’s longtime colleague, Agnes Chow, and two other activists were among those arrested, local media reported.</p> <p>In a Reuters interview in May, Lai pledged to stay in Hong Kong and continue to fight for democracy.</p> <p>Before Monday, 15 people, including teenagers, had been arrested under the new law.</p> <p>The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other officials, drawing mockery and condemnation from Beijing.</p> <p>The arrests show Hong Kong “wasn’t intimidated” by sanctions, Global Times editor Hu Xijin said in a tweet. Global Times is published by China’s official Communist Party newspaper, the People’s Daily.</p>",3

Within hours, the putschists, firing shots in the air, drove into town, detained Keita, took him to Kati and forced him to resign and dissolve parliament.</p> <p>Despite lofty promises to root out the problems that led to his predecessor’s demise - a security crisis caused by insurgents in the north and public perceptions of high-level corruption - those same factors proved Keita’s undoing.</p> <p>Disputed legislative elections in April and an anaemic economy further fuelled public anger, drawing tens of thousands of people on to the streets of Bamako in recent weeks to demand his resignation.</p> <p>Keita, widely known by his initials IBK, won re-election two years ago and his ruling coalition enjoyed a healthy majority in parliament.</p> <p>But that masked the depth of popular dissatisfaction, said Ibrahim Maiga, a Mali-based researcher at the Institute for Security Studies.</p> <p>“He wasn’t able to understand quickly enough the anger that cut across the entire society,” said Maiga. “He didn’t fully appreciate the strong demand for change in the country.”</p> <p>Keita came to office with a reputation for firmness forged as a prime minister in the 1990s when he took a hard line with striking trade unions. But from the start he was unable to get a handle on the security crisis in northern Mali.</p> <p>French forces had intervened in January 2013 to drive back al Qaeda-linked jihadists who had hijacked an ethnic Tuareg rebellion to seize the northern two-thirds of the country.</p> <p>Keita’s government struggled to assert control over Tuareg militias that continued to push for autonomy.</p> <p>The jihadists regrouped, inflicting heavy losses on Malian soldiers and civilians while extending their presence into central Mali and neighbouring countries.</p> <p>Attacks by the jihadists - some with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State - stoked tit-for-tat clashes between rival herding and farming communities that have eclipsed the violence by militants, claiming hundreds of lives this year alone.</p> <p>CORRUPTION</p> <p>Keita, who usually wears white flowing robes and has a tendency to slur his words, won a crushing election victory in August, 2013, with over 77% of the vote, and vowed to take on corruption.</p> <p>Junior military officers said widespread anger over graft under Toure was one of the triggers of their March 2012 coup.</p> <p>“Let me be clear. There is no question of sharing out the cake. I have not promised that and it will not happen,” Keita said, vowing to put an end to political patronage.</p> <p>Keita enjoyed strong international support, especially from former colonial master France, who poured money and troops into Mali.</p> <p>But his government quickly found itself mired in allegations of fraud and waste related to the purchase of a $40 million presidential jet and inflated spending on military supplies that led the International Monetary Fund to briefly delay aid.</p> <p>“In time of massive foreign military presence, there are opportunities for massive corruption,” said Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, a Mauritanian diplomat and former U.N. special representative in West Africa.</p> <p>Accusations of cronyism focused on Keita’s son, Karim, over his lavish lifestyle and position as chairman of parliament’s powerful defence and security committee.</p> <p>In a televised statement early on Wednesday, a spokesman for the putschists denounced the “political clientelism and family management of state affairs” under Keita.</p> <p>Videos shared on social media after Keita was detained show revellers splashing in the pool in Karim’s Bamako residence.</p> <p>Keita and his son always denied allegations of impropriety.</p> <p>The mass protests began in early June, spearheaded by a charismatic Muslim cleric, Mahmoud Dicko, who had supported Keita in the 2013 election but quickly soured on him.</p> <p>During demonstrations in July, security forces opened fire, killing at least 14 people and hardening opposition demands that Keita resign.</p> <p>He offered a series of concessions to the coalition of political opponents, religious leaders and civil society activists leading the protests, but they were rejected.</p> <p>As word of Keita’s detention spread in Bamako on Tuesday, thousands of people filled the streets, cheering soldiers as they sped through in military vehicles, firing rounds of celebratory gunfire into the air.</p> <p>“IBK did not want to listen to his people,” said Nouhoum Togo, a spokesman for the M5-RFP coalition that has led the protests. “He thought that France ... or the international community could save him.”</p>",3
924601877,Stop the US government’s $2-B arms sale to the Philippines,2020-05-20 00:00:00,"<p>Amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, the U.S. government is brokering a $2 billion arms sale to Duterte’s repressive regime, fueling a human rights catastrophe.</p> <p>By AMEE CHEW</p> <p>Bulatlat.com</p> <p>On April 30, the U.S. State Department announced two pending arms sales to the Philippines totaling nearly $2 billion. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter, and General Electric are the main weapons manufacturers contracted to profit from the deal.</p> <p>Following this announcement, a 30-day window for Congress to review and voice opposition to the sale commenced. It is imperative that we stop this avalanche of military aid for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s regime.</p> <p>Duterte’s human rights record is atrocious. If the arms sale goes through, it will escalate a worsening crackdown on human rights defenders and on dissent — while fomenting an ongoing bloodbath. Duterte is infamous for launching a “War on Drugs” that, since 2016, has claimed the lives of as many as 27,000 souls, mostly low-income people summarily executed by police and vigilantes.</p> <p>In Duterte’s first three years of office, nearly 300 journalists, human rights lawyers, environmentalists, peasant leaders, trade unionists, and human rights defenders were assassinated. The Philippines has been ranked the deadliest country for environmentalists in the world, after Brazil. Many of these slayings are linked to military personnel.</p> <p>Now, Duterte is using COVID-19 as a pretext for further militarization and repression, despite the dire consequences for public health.</p> <p>Around the world, and particularly for the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the contradiction between military capacity and human well-being. This arms deal is yet another example of the U.S. government’s gross misallocation of resources towards war profiteering and militarization, rather than health services and human needs. The Pentagon’s bloated budget of trillions has done nothing to protect us from a public health catastrophe, and has failed to create true security.</p> <p>Only a complete realignment of federal priorities away from militarization, here and abroad, and towards strengthening infrastructures of care will.</p> <p>Duterte’s militarized response to COVID-19</p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a pretext for Duterte to impose military checkpoints, mass arrests, and de facto martial law throughout the Philippines.</p> <p>As of late April, over 120,000 people have been cited for quarantine violations, and over 30,000 arrested — despite the severe overcrowding in Philippine jails, already exacerbated by the drug war. “Stay at home” orders are ruthlessly enforced by the police, even as in many urban poor communities, people live hand-to-mouth.</p> <p>Without daily earnings, millions are desperate for food. By late April, a majority of indigent households had still not received any government relief. A thousand residents in Pasay were forced into homelessness when their informal settlement was destroyed in the name of slum clearance at the beginning of the lockdown, even as the homeless are arrested and thrown in jail.</p> <p>Duterte has placed the military in charge of COVID-19 response. On April 1, he ordered troops to “shoot dead” quarantine violators, causing human rights abuses to immediately surge. The next day, a farmer, Junie Dugog Piñar, was shot and killed by police for violating the COVID-19 lockdown in Agusan del Norte, Mindanao.</p> <p>Police have locked curfew violators in dog cages, used torture and sexual humiliation as punishment against LGBTQ people, and beaten and arrested urban poor people protesting for food. Beatings and killings to enforce “enhanced community quarantine” continue. Meanwhile, a teacher was arrested simply for posting “provoking” comments on social media that decried the lack of government relief, while an artist was detained two nights without a warrant for a sarcastic post on COVID-19.</p> <p>Mutual aid, solidarity, and resistance</p> <p>In the face of widespread hunger, inadequate health care, and lethal repression, vibrant grassroots social movement organizations have created mutual aid and relief initiatives providing food, masks, and medical supplies to the poor.</p> <p>Cure Covid, a network of volunteers across myriad organizations in the greater Metro Manila region, has organized relief packs and community kitchens for thousands, while engaging in community organizing to strengthen mutual aid. Movement organizers are calling for mass testing, basic services, and an end to the militarized COVID-19 response.</p> <p>Kadamay is a mass-based organization of 200,000 urban poor people across the Philippines that has been at the forefront of resisting Duterte’s drug war and reclaiming vacant housing for homeless people. In 2017, Kadamay led 12,000 homeless people in occupying 6,000 vacant homes that had been set aside for the police and military in Pandi, Bulacan. Despite repression and intimidation, #OccupyBulacan continues to this day.</p> <p>With COVID-19, Kadamay has led mutual aid efforts and #ProtestFromHome pot-banging actions, with video disseminated on social media, to demand relief and health services, not militarization. In immediate reprisal for voicing dissent after one pot-banging, the national spokesperson of Kadamay, Mimi Doringo, was threatened with arrest. In Bulacan, a community leader was taken to a military encampment and told to cease all political activity and “surrender” to the government or he would get no relief aid.</p> <p>Efforts at mutual aid are being criminalized and targeted for repression. Since late April, police have carried out mass arrests of relief volunteers, alongside street vendors and those seeking food. On April 19, seven relief volunteers from Sagip Kanayunan were detained while on their way to distribute food in Bulacan, and later charged with inciting “sedition.” On April 24, 50 urban poor residents in Quezon City, including a relief volunteer, were detained for not carrying quarantine passes or wearing face masks. On May 1, ten volunteers conducting relief with the women’s organization Gabriela were arrested while conducting a community feeding in Marikina City.</p> <p>This targeting is no accident. Since 2018, an executive order by Duterte has authorized a “whole-of-nation approach” to counterinsurgency, through a broad array of government agencies, resulting in increased repression against community organizers and human rights defenders generally.</p> <p>The crackdowns against mutual aid and survival have prompted campaigns on social media to “stop criminalizing care and community.” Save San Roque, a network supporting the resistance of urban poor residents against demolition, has started a petition to immediately release relief volunteers and all low-level quarantine violators. Human rights organizations are also petitioning for the release of political prisoners, many of them low-income farmers, trade unionists, and human rights defenders facing trumped up charges, including the elderly and ill.</p> <p>As a direct result of the government response focused on militarization, rather than adequate health care, food, and services, the Philippines has among the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia, and the pandemic is quickly worsening.</p> <p>Colonial roots</p> <p>Today’s U.S.-Philippine military alliance has its roots in the U.S. colonization and occupation of the Philippines over a hundred years ago.</p> <p>Despite granting the Philippines independence in 1946, the U.S. has used unequal trade agreements and its military presence to maintain the Philippines’ neocolonial status ever since. For decades, propping up oligarchic rulers and preventing land reform guaranteed the U.S. cheap agricultural exports. The U.S. military assisted with countering a string of continual rebellions.</p> <p>U.S. military aid still continues to facilitate corporate extraction of Philippine natural resources, real estate monopoly, and repression of indigenous and peasant struggles for land rights — particularly in Mindanao, a hotbed of communist, indigenous, and Muslim separatist resistance and the recent center of military operations.</p> <p>The Philippine armed forces are focused on domestic counterinsurgency, overwhelmingly directing violence against poor and marginalized people within the country’s own borders. Philippine military and police operations are closely intertwined. In fact, historically the Philippine police developed out of counter-insurgency operations during U.S. colonial rule.</p> <p>The U.S. military itself maintains a troop presence in the Philippines through its Operation Pacific Eagle and other exercises.</p> <p>In the name of “counterterrorism,” U.S. military aid is helping Duterte wage war on Philippine soil and repress civilian dissent. Since 2017, Duterte has imposed martial law on Mindanao, where he has repeatedly dropped bombs. Military attacks have displaced over 450,000 civilians.</p> <p>Carried out with U.S. backing and even joint activities, Duterte’s military operations are shoring up the corporate land-grabbing of indigenous lands and massacres of farmers organizing for their land rights. Paramilitaries backed by the armed forces are terrorizing indigenous communities, targeting schools and teachers.</p> <p>In February, prior to the announced arms deal, Duterte nominally rescinded the U.S.-Philippines Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which allows U.S. troops to be stationed in the Philippines for “joint exercises.” On the surface, this was in response to the U.S. denying a visa to former drug war police chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa. However, Duterte’s revocation of the VFA is not immediately effective, and only begins a 6-month process of renegotiation.</p> <p>The proposed arms sale signals that Trump intends to strengthen his military backing for Duterte. The Pentagon seeks to maintain a close military “partnership.”</p> <p>End U.S. military aid</p> <p>A growing international movement, in solidarity with indigenous and Filipino communities, is calling for an end to military aid to the Philippines. U.S. direct military aid to Duterte’s regime totaled over $193.5 million in 2018, not counting pre-allocated amounts and donated weapons of unreported worth. Military aid also consists of grants to purchase arms, usually from U.S. contractors.</p> <p>Relatedly, the U.S. government regulates the flow of private arms sales abroad — such as the current proposed sale. Sales brokered by the U.S. government are often a public subsidy to private contractors, using our U.S. tax dollars to complete the purchase. Congress must use its power to cut the pending sale off.</p> <p>The latest proposed $2 billion arms sale includes 12 attack helicopters, hundreds of missiles and warheads, guidance and detection systems, machine guns, and over 80,000 rounds of ammunition. The State Department says these, too, would be used for “counterterrorism” — i.e., repression in the Philippines. Due to lack of transparency and Duterte’s deliberate efforts to obscure aid flows, U.S. military aid may well end up providing ammunition to the armed forces waging Duterte’s drug war, to vigilantes, or to paramilitaries, all without public scrutiny.</p> <p>Duterte is using the pandemic as a pretext to continue crushing political opposition. He has now assumed special emergency powers. Even prior to the pandemic, in October 2019, police and military raided the offices of Gabriela, opposition party Bayan Muna, and the National Federation of Sugar Workers, arresting over 57 people in Bacolod City and Metro Manila in one sweep.</p> <p>Tragically, repression is quickly escalating.</p> <p>On April 30, after weeks of police intimidation for conducting feeding programs, Jory Porquia, a founding member of Bayan Muna, was assassinated inside his home in Iloilo. Over 76 protesters and relief workers were illegally arrested on May Day, including four youth feeding program volunteers in Quezon City, four residents who posted online photos of their “protesting from home” in Valenzuela, two unionists holding placards in Rizal, and 42 people conducting a vigil for slain human rights defender Porquia in Iloilo. Sixteen workers in a Coca-Cola factory in Laguna were abducted and forced by the military to “surrender” posing as armed insurgents.</p> <p>The U.S.’s war machine profits its private contractors at our expense. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing relied on the Pentagon for a third of its income. In April, Boeing received a bailout of $882 million to restart a paused Air Force contract — for refueling aircraft that are in fact, defective. But for-profit weapons manufacturers and other war profiteers should have no place steering our foreign policy.</p> <p>Congress has the power to dissent but must act swiftly. Rep. Ilhan Omar has introduced a bill to stop arming human rights abusers such as Duterte. This month, the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines, Communications Workers of America, and others, will launch a bill specifically to end military aid to the Philippines. In the meantime, we must urge Congress to stop the proposed arms sales to the Philippines: please sign this petition to do so.</p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is baring the need for global solidarity against militarization and austerity. In taking up the fight against the deep footprint of U.S. imperialism, here and abroad, our movements will make each other stronger.</p> <p>*The author has a doctorate in American Studies and Ethnicity and is a Mellon-ACLS Public Fellow.

884988798,After a week in Hanoi: What we need to make a EU-Vietnam trade deal work,2019-11-07 11:12:01,"<p>The jury is out on whether a new EU-Vietnam trade pact will do anything to improve people’s livelihoods and arrest a deteriorating human rights record, writes Jude Kirton-Darling.</p> <p>Jude Kirton-Darling is a British MEP in the Socialists and Democrats group (S&D).</p> <p>Last week we learned that all the 39 people tragically found dead in a lorry in Essex were Vietnamese. The news reached me in Hanoi, where I was taking part in a European Parliament trade delegation. While MEPs are currently considering whether or not to support new comprehensive trade and investment deals with Vietnam, this horrendous story has shone a sombre light on the complex reality of our relationship with the world’s 15th biggest country. A complexity based on increasing flows of investment, goods and services taking place above the table, a deteriorating human rights environment according to Amnesty and others, and human trafficking hidden within plain sight.</p> <p>The question before us, as MEPs set to vote on this deal in January next year, must therefore be: will this trade deal help improve people’s livelihoods and rights, and offer a brighter future for Vietnamese at home? Or will it make matters worse?</p> <p>After an intensive and high-level trade delegation, including meetings with government, civil society, business and international organisations, I don’t have a definite answer yet. Ultimately, much depends on how the Vietnamese authorities respond in action to our concerns. In the months leading up to the ratification vote in the European Parliament, they can commit Vietnam to a path of progress, which the EU will support through renewed economic and diplomatic relations. But if they choose to ignore our concerns on fundamental freedoms, human rights and sustainable development, then I struggle to see how MEPs could endorse the deals.</p> <p>Central to this progressive agenda are labour rights in the country. Vietnam is producing more and more for the EU market – primarily telephone sets, electronic products, footwear, textiles and clothing – with imports from the country having nearly quadrupled over the past ten years. This makes labour rights in the country all the more important for EU consumers. While it is clearly not satisfactory today, the situation in this respect could soon change for the better with the right political leadership in Vietnam.</p> <p>There are currently no independent trade unions in this one-party state, but a revision of the Labour Code currently being debated by the National Assembly could grant workers the right to form their own grassroots organisations, hence enacting in Vietnamese law at least in the principle of ILO convention 87. The vote on the reform by the Vietnamese National Assembly, expected later this month, could also give workers new protections such as rules to prevent companies from abusing temporary contracts. Vietnam has already given us some tangible signs of its willingness to improve the situation in this respect. ILO Convention 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining was ratified by Vietnam in July this year and will enter into force in July 2020. Whether the Labour Code reform is adopted, and crucially whether subsequent implementing legislation confirms this progressive workers’ rights agenda will be key for EU parliamentarians in assessing the trade deal this winter. We will also be looking closely at whether Vietnam produces a credible roadmap towards the full ratification of ILO Convention 105 on the abolition of forced labour and ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association by 2020 and 2023, respectively.</p> <p>But as many organisations such as Human Rights Watch have pointed out, labour rights are not the whole story: human rights more broadly are at stake in these trade negotiations, and a positive vote from the EP should only come as a result of progress for fundamental freedoms overall. In this respect the situation is very concerning. According to several sources, there are currently over a hundred political prisoners in the country, and the number is rising. While the European Parliament delegation was in Hanoi, two online activists were sentenced to prison terms for sharing content on social media, or according to Vietnam’s penal code “conducting anti-state propaganda” and “abusing democratic freedom”. The rights to free expression, association and assembly are severely curtailed. The judiciary, the press and civil society are under tight government control. Over recent years, the European Parliament has adopted several resolutions condemning Vietnam for its human rights record, and demanded concrete changes. The response from Vietnamese authorities have been unsatisfactory thus far. The most recent European Parliament resolution, in November 2018, notably called for the release of all political prisoners. Since then, only one of them was freed – but only because he had completed his prison term. The resolution also called for putting an end to the harassment of human rights defenders, lifting restrictions on religious freedom, ensuring the humane treatment for all detainees, ensuring fair trials, adopting a revision of the Penal Code and enacting a moratorium on the death penalty.</p> <p>One recent piece of legislation has attracted specific criticism: a new cyber security law that entered into force at the start of 2019. Actors on the ground have documented an intensified crackdown on human rights activism in the country, linked to the provisions of the new law that give the authorities licence to censor content, control information and silence online dissidents. The legislation also raises concerns for EU economic interests, including forced data localisation provisions which are at odds with the EU’s liberalisation agenda in this respect. This law must be revised to be brought in line with international standards.</p> <p>Greater trade between the EU and Vietnam could be beneficial to people on both sides, creating jobs and lowering costs, but only if it underpins fundamental rights and better working conditions. Before we vote in the European Parliament, we need a strong signal from Vietnam that this trade deal will deliver on its sustainable development promises. This implies concrete action on labour rights, human rights and the cyber-security law. This was the message that was audible and I hope was heard in Hanoi during our visit.</p>",3

1025789101,LankaWeb – The Heir of Yahapalana Govt’s Failed Agenda,2022-01-30 00:00:00,"<p>The Heir of Yahapalana Govt’s Failed Agenda</p> <p>By Shivanthi Ranasinghe Courtesy Ceylon Today</p> <p>By Shivanthi Ranasinghe</p> <p>Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa’s response to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s opening statement of the second session of the ninth Parliament was thought provoking. Leaving aside his need to portray the Government as a failure, one must pay attention to the remarks he made vis-a-vis the military. That he makes his references to the military in his opening remarks itself makes this exercise important.</p> <p>The Opposition Leader notes that national security in its broad sense includes many aspects. The first element he declares is military security. Taking the recent incident involving the discovery of a hand grenade at All Saints Church in Borella, he builds his case that the military security under this Government has failed.</p> <p>Cardinal’s Misgivings</p> <p>Soon after the bomb was discovered, Cardinal Ranjith called a press conference to air his misgivings with the ongoing investigation. His contention was the Police did not seem to take into account a person who was in church that morning.</p> <p>Unwittingly, the Cardinal revealed certain facts the investigators were unwilling to make public at the time. Nevertheless, the Police were able to track the perpetrator — a septuagenarian, obviously disturbed by bitter memories. The Cardinal, perhaps embarrassed, has not retracted his accusations – especially as the perpetrator claims to have had suffered discrimination at the hands of the church.</p> <p>The Cardinal’s comments irked Defence Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne. However, the need is for both the Cardinal and the Government to work on their deteriorating trust issues. Both need to understand that our country is not at a juncture where we can afford to let our ego get in the way.</p> <p>Capitalising on the Cardinal’s apprehensions, the Opposition Leader claims that military security has failed. The military, however, does not play a role in this bomb incident. This is a matter entirely for the Police.</p> <p>Even the dastardly Easter Attacks came under the purview of the TID, SIS and CID. The role the MI played was minimal. Even the underworld uses bombs and worse. Still, it is the Police that must deal with it and not the military. Therefore, the reason for a learned man who takes mighty pride in his knowledge to state the military had failed on a matter that concerns the Police is curious.</p> <p>This accusation itself is absurd. During the past two years, the entire world was crippled by the pandemic. Sri Lanka, however, managed better than most countries and that was because of the enormous service rendered by the military right from the onset.</p> <p>For instance, Sri Lanka’s vaccination programme has been tremendously successful. For a short while, it was in danger of being foiled because of trade union actions. However, the military took over the vaccination programme and did a far more efficient job. Today, not even vaccine producing countries like the US or India has the kind of record Sri Lanka has achieved. This was only possible because of the military. Yet, not once during his long speech did the Opposition Leader acknowledge the strength of the military and the services rendered by them to our country.</p> <p>Therefore, we must understand the reason for Sajith Premadasa to attack on the military in the opening remarks itself. He may have broken away from the UNP and distanced himself from Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, it is clear that he has not distanced himself from the agenda the UNP undertook when forming the Yahapalana Government.</p> <p>The Yahapalana Grudge</p> <p>A defining feature of the Yahapalana Government was its relentless persecution of the military, mostly the Military Intelligence (MI). Entire MI teams were detained by the CID, which was then headed by the politically corrupt SSP Shani Abeysekera. In addition, the then Yahapalana Government tried its level best to throw behind bars the top military brass that gave leadership to end terrorism in the Island.</p> <p>Among this target list were incumbent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who functioned as the Defence Secretary, highly-decorated Major General K.A.D. Amal Karunasekara who functioned as the Director Military Intelligence, Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda who was the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy and Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne. Both Major General Karunasekara and Admiral Wijegunaratne were ignominiously detained by the CID over charges built on flimsy evidence.</p> <p>For instance, Major General Karunasekara was arrested by the CID in April 2018 over the abduction and assault of a national newspaper’s Associate Editor in May 2008. Much publicity was given to the investigation team that flew to Australia, where he now domiciled, to get his statement. However, very little Media coverage was given to his statement itself, which stated the investigators were after the wrong men. Yet, it took months more before the CID reluctantly released eight serving and former officers of the Directorate of Military Intelligence. The case, after dancing in the Media for 18 months quietly slithered away.</p> <p>Ramanayake’s Treacherous Task</p> <p>Likewise, all these cases that targeted the MI were projected as high profile despite the paucity of evidence. The investigators could not furnish enough evidence to even file a b-report. Yet, they were exposed to the full glare of the Media. They were thus humiliated disregarding the enormous service rendered by these individuals during and after the war to usher and ensure peace in the country.</p> <p>Interestingly, every single officer and man that was thus arrested had played a pivotal role in defeating the LTTE. Furthermore, some were still engaged in defending the country from attempts to revive the terrorist group.</p> <p>The LTTE’s international network is still very active across the world. This entity that propagated the LTTE ideology bought sympathy for its macabre cause by getting politicians and journalists to delve deep in to their pockets. They funded terrorist activities in Sri Lanka and India which still continue to haunt us.</p> <p>The MI unit that shadowed these activities was arrested in 2015 over the disappearance of a supposedly tabloid journalist Prageeth Eknalogoda, who was unknown until his disappearance. To date, investigators do not know if his disappearance was voluntary or not. Apart from his estranged wife, who gained publicity and perhaps monetary assistance, no one else benefited from his disappearance. In fact, he only became famous because his disappearance is something of a mystery. Therefore, his importance to the MI or their need for him to disappear has not yet been established.</p> <p>Subsequently, recorded telephone conversations between former MP Ranjan Ramanayake and SSP Abeysekera revealed the political motivation behind these arrests. Ramanayaka, who is currently serving a four-year prison sentence for contempt of court, claims that he had never stolen from the public.</p> <p>Be that as it may, the role he played was far worse in persecuting opponents of the Yahapalana Government. From his own recordings, he exposed the political favours he promised judges and his manipulation of the CID’s functions and investigations through the Director of the CID himself.</p> <p>Thus, it is extremely distasteful when SLPP MPs as Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgama and Geetha Kumarasinghe support the SJB’s call for a presidential pardon for Ramanayake. Perhaps MP Kumarasinghe’s sympathy stems from the fact that they are both from the same profession. Minister Aluthgamage is keen to prove that his battles with Ramanayaka are over. This level of immature reasoning distracts the actual damage caused by Ramanayaka.</p> <p>Premadasa, too, speaks of Ramanayake as a comrade. He is yet to condemn Ramanayake’s attempts to corrupt our law enforcement officers for political gain. Premadasa never visited any of the officers or men or their families during their incarceration visited Ramanayake in prison.</p> <p>Ramanayake’s efforts to persecute the MI must be analysed. The investigators did not have sufficient evidence to pursue the case. As in the case of Eknaligoda, it’s not clear if a crime took place. Yet, Ramanayake’s dedicated task was to ensure that investigators and judges breathed life into the persecution.</p> <p>Killing the MI</p> <p>The Yahapalana Government came to power on the promise to prosecute the corrupt. The failure to do so severely discredited that Government. However, persecuting the military was not part of that promise. In fact, then President Maithripala Sirisena even claimed his Government saved the military from possible prosecution from international courts.</p> <p>Yet, the persecution of the military continued – even though it contributed to that Government’s growing unpopularity. The public openly rallied around the Major who was order to pay Rs 2 million as compensation to the family of a terrorist, who was shot dead as he tried to escape arrest. Notwithstanding all these factors – lack of evidence and public disenchantment – the Yahapalana Government continued to engage in its agenda.</p> <p>The shocking conclusion is the Yahapalana Government was never interested in delivering justice to the victims, alleged or real. They just gave the excuse to hound the MI. Exposing the identity of an MI officer is the best way to end their career. One who works for the MI or any other intelligence unit does not operate in uniform but in anonymity. They must blend with the environment as needed. Until the very public arrests of these officers and men, even their own families did not know their role or responsibility.</p> <p>As their identity got exposed, their active networks and ongoing operations were compromised. The roles they play in these operations are built over a long period of time. Thus, it is not possible for one to be replaced with another. Even former officers and men became targets because their actions played a direct role in the LTTE’s downfall. The turning point of the war was when the MI became an active component. The intelligence they gathered and their unique strategies hampered the LTTE.</p> <p>As such, the LTTE international network is bitterly angry with the MI. The anger of this network is useful to the West’s and India’s geopolitics that sees use in keeping Sri Lanka destabilised. Keeping the country’s national security weak and dumbing down its intelligence is important for this side of geopolitics. Having come to power on the shoulders of these wicked elements, the Yahapalana Government was beholden to discredit the military and weaken its intelligence.</p> <p>The Yahapalana Government was not an unwilling participant. The UNP opposed the war against terrorism, even to the extent of informing every international lending agency that they will not honour the loans given to fund the war. Hence, when terrorism was defeated they too were politically massacred. Their only way out is to discredit the war itself and criminalise those who rendered a great service to the country. Therefore, persecuting the MI and other efforts to imprison Military leaders was very satisfying to these discredited politicians. This was a bonus to the agenda set by their handlers.</p> <p>Power over Patriotism</p> <p>Premadasa is a victim of the LTTE. His father was assassinated by the LTTE, despite the support he gave them. He, more than any other, should be grateful to the military for ending that era of killing and destruction.</p> <p>Yet, even when he met the UK Minister of State Foreign Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, he failed to set the record straight on the alleged war crimes. Lord Ahmad is one of the main British politicians leading the persecution against the Sri Lankan military. He categorically had refused to take into account the records compiled by the British Home Office by the then British Defence Attaché Lt Col Anthony Gash simply because it does not fit the narrative against</p> <p>Sri Lanka.</p> <p>It is truly a sad state of affairs that the regime changes have an heir to carry their mantle – even after the resolute defeat of the Yahapalana Government.</p> <p>ranasingheshivanthi@gmail.com</p>",3
1025527752,"Submission to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on Uzbekistan",2022-01-28 00:00:00,"<p>This submission to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ahead of its review of Uzbekistan focuses on issues of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (Articles 2 and 12), forced labour (Article 6, 7 and 8), rehabilitation of former political prisoners (Article 6 and 12) and violence against women (Articles 3 and 10).</p> <p>Since the last review of Uzbekistan’s compliance with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2014, the government of Uzbekistan has made human rights improvements following President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s assumption of power following the death of Islam Karimov. For example, there was a marked reduction in forced labor in Uzbekistan’s cotton fields, and a handful of nongovernmental organizations were allowed to register. However, many human rights groups still face significant obstacles trying to register their organizations, and Uzbekistan’s political system remains largely authoritarian. Consensual same-sex relations between men continue to be criminalized, carrying a prison sentence of one to three years.</p> <p>Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (Articles 2 and 12)</p> <p>Under article 120 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, men in Uzbekistan who engage in consensual same-sex sexual conduct can be prosecuted and face three-years imprisonment.[1] Uzbek authorities have repeatedly dismissed calls to decriminalize homosexuality, and a new draft Criminal Code[2] retains the offense, with the wording unchanged, in article 154, in a section of the code related to “crimes against morality and family”.</p> <p>Gay men face threats and extortion by both police and non-state actors. Uzbek law has no provision for hate crimes, nor can crimes be prosecuted as aggravated offenses if they are motivated by hatred based on discrimination. Uzbekistan has yet to adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that includes sexual orientation and gender identity as a protected ground. As of September 2019, the Uzbek government said there were no ongoing criminal investigations involving violence against LGBT people.</p> <p>Uzbek police and courts have relied on the conclusions of forced anal examinations conducted between 2017 and 2021 to prosecute men for consensual same-sex relations. In a recent case of which Human Rights Watch is aware, Internal Affairs officials ordered doctors to perform forced anal exams on two men in early 2021. A Tashkent court sentenced both men to two years under house arrest, partly based on medical reports from the exams purporting to find evidence of same-sex conduct. The men, who had lived together before the arrest, were ordered to serve their sentences in cities 500 kilometers apart and have been prohibited from using the internet. The verdict against the two men confirms that both were subjected to forced anal exams while in detention. The ruling relied in part on a medical examiner’s report suggesting that “bruises and superficial tears,” “radial turns” that are “slightly smooth,” and a “slightly weakened” anal sphincter tone were likely evidence of anal sex. The court ruling seems to rely on bogus theories[3] popularized by an 1857 French medical text on how to identify a “habitual pederast” through anal examination.[4]</p> <p>Forced anal exams, conducted purportedly to find “proof” of homosexual conduct, often involve doctors or other medical personnel inserting their fingers, and sometimes other objects, into the anus of the accused without their consent, in an attempt to determine whether the person has engaged in receptive anal intercourse. The World Health Organization has denounced the exams as a form of violence and torture.[5]</p> <p>The World Medical Association[6] has called on medical professionals to stop conducting the exams, saying that it is “deeply disturbed by the complicity of medical personnel in these non-voluntary and unscientific examinations, including the preparation of medical reports that are used in trials to convict men and transgender women of consensual same-sex conduct.”[7]</p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:</p> <p>Decriminalize consensual same sex conduct between men and halt any prosecutions under article 120 of the Criminal Code; ensure the personal security, privacy, and non-discrimination of the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in Uzbekistan;</p> <p>Immediately ban forced anal exams and their use as evidence to prosecute men for consensual same-sex relations;</p> <p>Investigate attacks and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including threats made by law enforcement officers to use article 120 against people, and hold those responsible to account;</p> <p>Adopt effective nondiscrimination policies, combat violence, harassment, and hatred against LGBT people, and facilitate the registration and operation of nongovernmental groups working on LGBT issues.</p> <p>Labour rights (Article 6, 7 and 8)</p> <p>Since the last review of Uzbekistan’s record, Uzbekistan has made significant efforts to reduce forced labor in its cotton sector. Positive steps that contributed to reduction of forced labour are the criminalization in January 2020 of the repeated use of forced labour, and the elimination in March 2020 of the production quota system.</p> <p>Although the International Labour Organization (ILO) concluded in January 2021 that there was no systemic forced or child labor in the 2020 cotton harvest, it noted that “about four percent [of pickers] were subject to direct or perceived forms of coercion,” that is, approximately 80,000 people.[8] In October 2020, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights reported that the government forced employees of public institutions and enterprises to pick cotton or pay for replacement pickers during the 2020 harvest.</p> <p>The ILO also noted that in the 2020 cotton harvest “there were [only] isolated cases of minors below the legal working age picking cotton.” However, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights[9] found during the Fall 2021 cotton harvest “more cases of child labor than in recent years, when only sporadic cases were identified …they [children] were accompanied by their parents and likely reflects increasing poverty in rural areas.” Nevertheless for the cotton harvest in 2021, for the first time in more than a decade of monitoring cotton harvest, Uzbek Forum for Human Rights found no systematic forced labor organized by state officials.</p> <p>However, the progress in elimination forced labour varies greatly between different regions of Uzbekistan. The Uzbek Forum documented that in areas which lack voluntary pickers, officials of mahalla (neighbourhood committees) resorted to pressure on potential pickers, by threatening residents that their social benefits would be reduced or withheld. Farmers lack bargaining power when it comes to negotiating their contracts and cotton price.[10]</p> <p>The lack of independent trade unions and civil society organizations in Uzbekistan to protect workers’ rights and monitor the government’s compliance with the ban on forced labor undermines sustainability of progress made so far in the cotton sector.</p> <p>During the reporting period, the authorities in Uzbekistan interfered regularly in the work of civil society. For example, on February 1, 2020 in Nukus, a city in Karakalpakstan, several activists, and the founding members of Chiroq, an NGO that focuses on monitoring forced labor in the cotton sector, met with five representatives of the Cotton Campaign[11] member organizations, including two staff members of Human Rights Watch. Early in the morning, a traffic police officer stopped a human rights defender, Arslanbay Utepov, as he was driving to the meeting. The police took Utepov to the local administration, where the authorities held him until the evening, and warned him not to interact with international human rights organizations. The police officers also stopped Zaripbay Reymov, a member and co-founder of Chiroq, on his way to the meeting. The officers seized his phone and took him to a police station, holding him there until the afternoon. On that day, Chiroq’s founder, Guldana Seidemetova, was urgently ordered to come to a clinic where she works “because a commission from Tashkent was coming,” but no commission arrived.</p> <p>In its Concluding observations on the second periodic report of Uzbekistan in 2014, the Committee called on the Uzbek authorities to repeal “the mandatory registration requirement for non-governmental organizations and revising national legislation in line with its obligations under article 8 of the Covenant and article 34 of the Constitution of Uzbekistan, which affirms the right of citizens to form their own organizations”[12].</p> <p>Since the last review, the government has taken some important steps to ease the registration process regulated by the 2014 Cabinet of Ministers Decree on the procedure for state registration of nongovernmental nonprofit organizations.[13] These steps include significantly reducing[14] the registration fee, cutting[15] the time period for government review of registration documents from two months to one month, and opening[16] a portal that allows submission of applications by nongovernmental groups online. But vague and burdensome rules remain in place.</p> <p>In recent years, Uzbek authorities also claim that civil society organizations[17] “are becoming a full partner of the state” and that “measures are being taken to increase their role and importance”.[18] Yet the Justice Ministry repeatedly denies registration to independent groups on trivial and technical grounds. Without registration, the groups are not permitted to legally work in the country. In April 2021, the Humanitarian Legal Center in Bukhara was denied registration for the ninth time. The volunteer youth group Oltin Qanot (“Golden Wing”) has been denied registration 21 times. In September 2021, after being denied registration for the eighth time, the founders of the rights group Human Rights House filed a lawsuit against the Justice Ministry.</p> <p>In October 2019, President Mirziyoyev ordered the establishment of a working group to prepare a new code for nongovernmental groups with the aim of streamlining legislation on civil society and ordered the draft to be submitted for review to the Cabinet of Ministers by February 1, 2020. In January 2020, the draft was finalized, but it failed to eliminate the existing restrictions, according to assessments by local civil society experts. Subsequent deadlines have been missed. Human Rights Watch was not aware of further steps taken to finalize the draft code and it has not been made available to the public.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:</p> <p>Fully abolish the practice of forced labor in cotton fields, including by holding accountable local authorities that mobilize state emergency services staff and private sector employees.</p> <p>Liberalize registration procedures for NGOs and register independent civil society; organizations, including international human rights groups, and those who have been repeatedly denied registration;</p> <p>Stop intervening with the work of civil society organisations aimed at documenting violations of economic, social and cultural rights;</p> <p>Provide information on the new code for nongovernmental groups;</p> <p>Allow independent trade unions to register and operate without fear of retaliation and uphold commitments to implement ILO Conventions 87 and 98.</p> <p>Rehabilitation of former political prisoners (article 6 and 12)</p> <p>The Uzbek government has released more than 50 people imprisoned on politically motivated charges, including journalists, human rights defenders, and other activists since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took office in September 2016.[19]</p> <p>Released political prisoners face legal and economic barriers following their release, including restrictions on freedom of movement, inability to obtain court decisions needed to appeal unlawful sentences, surveillance, and inadequate medical care for health ailments stemming from their incarceration. Former political prisoners face great difficulties reintegrating into their families and society after years or decades in prison. Many are suffering from severe physical and psychological health problems resulting from years of torture and detention in dismal conditions, often in isolation from other prisoners or in prisons far from their families. Social support structures and services they need are largely non-existent, meaning they must depend on often ill-prepared family members for the support they need.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:</p> <p>Ensure former political prisoners receive full legal rehabilitation to enable them to take a full part in society;</p> <p>Address the significant medical, mental health, and economic needs of former political prisoners as they attempt to reintegrate into society;</p> <p>Ensure their access to adequate and appropriate medical care to treat all health problems linked to their imprisonment.</p> <p>Violence against Women (article 10)</p> <p>Deep inequality between men and women persists in Uzbekistan. Domestic violence remains a serious problem. In 2014, the Committee called on the Uzbek authorities to criminalise domestic violence and adopt the draft law on preventing violence against women.[20] To this day, neither domestic violence nor marital rape are explicitly criminalized, and the draft Criminal Code, published in February 2021, did not include a standalone offence of domestic violence. Between January and March 2021, the Internal Affairs Ministry registered 11,070 complaints of harassment and violence against women. While the State Commission on Gender Equality reported in 2019 that it had opened 197 rehabilitation and adaptation centers for women who experience violence, a June 2020 media report found that many such centers “did not exist” or “did not function” as intended.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:</p> <p>Urgently introduce criminal provisions to ensure domestic violence is a stand-alone crime and subject to public prosecution and appropriate punishments commensurate with the gravity of the abuse;</p> <p>Ensure that survivors of domestic abuse have immediate and straightforward access to protection, including through ensuring sufficient shelter spaces, including in rural areas.</p>",3
1008873042,Beyond Cable Street: An unsettled legacy of British fascism,2021-10-12 14:48:00,"<p>Monday, October 4 marked the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Cable Street. On Sunday October 4, 1936, thousands of members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Moseley organized a march through London’s East End with the intent to commit horrific violence towards London’s Jewish community, which at that time predominantly lived in that area. However, the Jewish community knew an attack might be coming, so the Jewish People’s Council against Fascism and Antisemitism organized a demonstration with Irish dockworkers, socialists, trade unionists, and communists to fight against the fascist attack.</p> <p>As the fascists ascended to Cable Street they were also guided by thousands of police officers, who were more than eager to protect them against those the state considered less than desirable. However, they were hit by a roadblock when they were met by the 20,000 strong anti fascist contingency who fought back against the fascist force with anything they could get their hands on, they eventually succeeded in getting Moseley to call his utterly demoralized Blackshirts to retreat. For one day the Jewish community of London could rest, knowing they and their fellow antifascists were able to defeat the fascists and protect the East End from a pogrom.</p> <p>For one day.</p> <p>This memory of Cable Street has remained in our memory because it serves as a reminder of the narrative Britain has served to establish itself during WWII, a plucky force of people who through resiliency stood together to defeat fascism.</p> <p>The reality however, is far more disturbing.</p> <p>Because the Battle of Cable Street was just a battle, and the fascists did not suddenly go away. In fact, they had only grown stronger, they had recruited over 2,000 new members. On October 10th, as antifascist demonstrators were marching and celebrating their victory they were greeted by a mass of people “gesturing and screaming “the Yids, the Yids, we’ve got to get rid of the Yids”. At the corner of Bethnal Green and Roman Road, a double wall of police held back hundreds of young men and women shouting, “up the fascism, dirty Yids”.</p> <p>As the fascists were violently clashing with the protesters, this was only meant to serve as a deterrent to the real attack. The rest of the Blackshirts stormed into the East End and attacked Jewish shops and businesses with anything they could get their hands on. Jews were physically thrown out of the windows of their shops, and cars were set ablaze. This became known as the Mile End Pogrom. It was a scene that would not have been out of place in Nazi Germany. One shopkeeper voiced the community’s fears when he said, “I fear this is only the beginning.” For as Hitler’s bombs poured down on London, the Jews of the East End soon faced a new threat in the malice of Winston Churchill.</p> <p>While not as genocidal as his views towards colonized people, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, Winston Churchill held deeply antisemitic views which were exacerbated by his longtime support for the Zionist colonial project. As Home Secretary in 1911, Churchill was present at the Battle of Stepney, an armed confrontation between police and Lativan revolutionaries, these revolutionaries were rumored to be Jewish and this influenced Churchill to strengthen the Aliens Act, which would have severely further restricted Jewish refugees from entering the UK.</p> <p>The Aliens Act of 1905 was one of the first acts restricting immigration in the UK and it was primarily advocated by the PM at the time Arthur Balfour as an attempt to institute restrictions on Jewish refugees fleeing pogroms in the Russian Empire. Balfour was a notorious antisemite, who later would issue the Balfour Declaration, expressing support for a Jewish state in Palestine. This contradiction was not lost on Britain’s Jews at the time who saw Zionism as a clear attempt to get rid of all Jews on the European continent. For Balfour especially, it also served as a way to propagate his Christian end times theorist desires. It was particularly evident from the very start that Zionism required the support of antisemites for the establishment of their settler colonial state.</p> <p>Churchill himself was an ardent Zionist throughout his life, and his term as Home Secretary was not the only time he expressed antisemitic views. He openly propagated Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy theories, and in 1920 he claimed that ​​”international Jews” were leading a “world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation”. Additionally, in 1937 he wrote a paper criticizing the “aloofness” and “separation” of Jews from wider society, and claimed they were “partly responsible for the antagonism for which they suffer.”</p> <p>This culminated when during the London Blitz of 1940-1941, as German bombs were raining down on London, Churchill intentionally left the East End to fend for themselves. Because the East End was predominantly filled with Jews and other immigrants, there was less of a priority to provide them with adequate shelters. In fact, these were the areas which did end up with too few shelters, as after six weeks of bombing a quarter of a million people in the East End had lost their homes and were without shelter. They were forced to resort to using tube stations for shelter, for which 100-150,000 used on any given night.</p> <p>The Jewish community of England continued to be terrorized by fascists for years after Cable Street and again by another significant resurgence of Nazism during the 1960’s with Colin Jordan’s National Socialist Movement.</p> <p>While Nazism and antisemitism has never truly died out in London– just as with the rest of Europe, England is inherently built on antisemitism and the persecution of Jews. Still white Jews were able to eventually assimilate into further benefiting from a white supremacist system, especially as more grew to adopt colonialist Zionist views. As the Windrush Generation and other immigrants of color from the former British Empire immigrated to England, they became a more visible target within a country structurally built on white supremacy and colonialism.</p> <p>Less than a mile away from Cable Street lies the Altab Ali Park, named in memory of Altab Ali, a Bangladeshi textile worker who was brutally stabbed to death in 1978 by white supremacists, a stark reminder that fascism did not die with Cable Street.</p>",3

963419660,A #MeToo Case Loses In Court And A Comic’s Taboo-Breaking Jokes Go Viral,2021-01-08 22:32:22,"<p>A Hangzhou court has found a journalist guilty of defamation for accusing a senior colleague of sexually assaulting her in 2009, dealing the nation’s #MeToo movement a courtroom defeat. In 2018, He Qian alleged that Deng Fei groped her while she was a 21-year-old intern and he was chief reporter for Phoenix Weekly. Deng then sued He for defamation. A Hangzhou court concurred with Deng, ordering He Qian and Zou Sicong, who published her accusations on his website, to pay Deng $1,813 in damages. Her case bears obvious similarities to that of prominent #MeToo activist Xianzi, who last month appeared in court to press sexual harassment charges against CCTV anchor Zhu Jun. Public awareness surrounding gender violence rose sharply in 2020, especially after pop star Tan Weiwei released her single “Xiao Juan (Pseudonym),” which documented a litany of violent (and often unprosecuted) crimes perpetrated against women. For The Associated Press, Huizhong Wu reported on He Qian’s plight, and the difficulty victims of sexual assault have proving their case in court:</p> <p>A court in the eastern city of Hangzhou ruled Tuesday that the evidence provided by Zou Sicong and He Qian against prominent journalist Deng Fei was “not enough to allow someone to firmly believe without any hesitation that what was described truly happened.” […] Throughout the process, Zou and He said they faced a higher burden of proof under Chinese law. Although China allowed sexual misconduct as a ground for lawsuits in 2019, the definition of such harassment remains murky and very few cases are filed. Many have been prosecuted in courts as labor disputes or under laws to protect public reputations. […] “This is equal to telling someone who was humiliated, who was hurt, that if you don’t have audio recordings or videos of the event, then you better hurry up and shut your mouth,” Zou’s and He’s lawyer, Xu Kai, said in a statement. “The court had imposed the entire burden of proof on Zou Sicong and He Qian.” […] Zhou Xiaoxuan [also known as Xianzi], the face of one of China’s most high-profile #MeToo cases, said she did not see the ruling as a defeat. “It was very brave then for He Qian to speak out about this with her real name. She did this for the rights of other women.” [Source]</p> <p>At The New York Times, Javier C. Hernández interviewed He Qian and Zou Sicong, the two defendants:</p> <p>“Chinese law needs to do more to respond to #MeToo,” Ms. He, who also uses the first name Belinda, said in an interview. “This is only the beginning and far from enough.” […] Mr. Zou said Chinese law should be more responsive to women who bring forward allegations of assault and harassment. “Hoping a topic will just disappear and return to the old world is ignorant and peremptory,” he wrote on WeChat, a popular social media app. “I will take responsibility until the end for publishing the article about He Qian.” […] Feng Yuan, a co-founder of a women’s rights nonprofit group in Beijing, said the court had “completely denied the existence of sexual harassment.” “Many people will feel even more powerless in the face of sexual harassment,” Ms. Feng said. [Source]</p> <p>He Qian is one of the victims accused of reputation infringement since 2018. Her loss once again shows how cruel the legal system is to victims of sexual assault. Insiders said that Deng Fei, the alleged rapist, has been using his personal relationships to prevent media coverage. https://t.co/QgAUcxMQsT — FreeChineseFeminists (@FeministChina) January 7, 2021</p> <p>In the aftermath of Xianzi’s December trial, The Economist wrote about the Chinese Communist Party’s fraught relationship with feminist activists, who the Party views as potentially subversive:</p> <p>Many aspects of the system in China are heavily skewed in favour of men, not least in employment and family matters. The World Economic Forum places China above South Korea and Japan in its ranking of countries by gender equality. But since Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012 his country has fallen from 69th to 106th on that list, below Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Despite this, more women than ever in China are gaining degrees. In 2009, for the first time, the number of female undergraduates surpassed those who were male. Since then women have retained this majority. Young highly educated women have been at the forefront of China’s #MeToo movement. Their demands for rights as women are “very difficult to suppress”, says Wang Zheng of the University of Michigan. The Communist Party accuses “hostile foreign forces” of stoking such advocacy. In 2015 police arrested a group of women merely for planning to hand out stickers about sexual harassment on public transport. The “feminist five”, as they became known, were released only after weeks in prison, and after news of their plight had sparked outrage in China and abroad. When visiting the state-backed All-China Women’s Federation in 2018, President Xi said the organisation “absolutely must not become one of those organisations like they have in other countries for feminists or posh women”. Though stifled by the government, campaigning has made some impact. “Prior to #MeToo, discussions about women and gender in mainstream media and on social media were quite limited,” says Zhang Zhiqi, the host of a podcast popular among feminists in China. “There’s now a lot more awareness about gender equality and I think that’s due to #MeToo.” [Source]</p> <p>At ChinaFile, Shen Lu investigated the glaring gender disparities in the Chinese Communist Party’s ranks, which belie the Party’s own claims to upholding gender equality:</p> <p>According to the state-sponsored All-China Women’s Federation, women comprise 37.5 percent of the 4 million members of the Party’s neighborhood and village committees, which enforce Party mandates and maintain social order. But, the higher women move up the rungs of government hierarchy, the fewer their female peers. Less than 9 percent of Party secretaries and heads of local governments at the provincial, municipal, and county levels are women. At the county level, women make up 9.33 percent of leadership, 5.29 percent at the city-level, and 3.23 percent at the provincial level. […] This data was last updated in 2017. […] Women don’t enjoy equal representation in the Party’s rank and file, either. As of 2018, they made up 27 percent of China’s 90 million Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. […] But while Chinese women’s overall political representation has improved over the years, women still barely appear in positions of government and Party leadership, and seldom rise above the rank of deputy, according to data from the All-China Women’s Federation and National Bureau of Statistics. Currently, out of China’s 31 provincial governors, only two are women. In November, Shen Yiqin was promoted to Party secretary of Guizhou province, becoming China’s sole female provincial Party secretary, a position that is “the most important stepping stone to a Politburo seat,” according to Cheng Li, director of The Brookings Institution’s China Center. The two female provincial governors and one Party secretary make 4.84 percent of all governors and secretaries, an improvement from just the two governors, or 3.23 percent, in 2017. […] Indeed, data compiled by the international affairs scholars David Bulman and Kyle Jaros on the tenures and backgrounds of Provincial Party Standing Committee (PPSC) members between 1996 and 2017 show that female cadres disproportionately headed entities such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (41 percent) and United Front Work Department (26 percent). “These assignments imply that the Party perceives female cadre comparative advantage through traditionally gendered lenses: Female cadres are effective communicators and dialogue facilitators rather than leaders in their own right,” Bulman says. By contrast, women are underrepresented in functional departments where ultimate power resides. While 7.5 percent of all PPSC members were female, only 0.7 percent of Party secretaries and 6.2 percent of deputy Party secretaries were women, during those 21 years.

At The New York Times, Tiffany May profiled Yang Li, whose sharp joke about men’s incongruous self-confidence went viral, to the chagrin of a small group of “defenders of men’s rights”:</p> <p>One of her lines in particular has set off fierce online debate: “How can he look so average and still have so much confidence?” A lot of men didn’t find it funny. And that, said many of Ms. Yang’s defenders, is exactly the point. […] On Sunday, a group calling itself a defender of men’s rights began an online campaign aimed at getting the attention of government censors. It offered a sample letter to send to China’s media regulator accusing Ms. Yang of “insulting all men” and “propagating hatred.” The post was later deleted amid criticism. […] Ms. Yang responded to some of her male critics in a special routine last week, saying, “They think I’m the most abominable witch in the world. Everything they’ve suffered is because I said, ‘How can you look so average and be so confident?’” […] In her show last week, Ms. Yang said that her supporters outnumbered her critics. “A joke can only get laughs for one reason,” she said. “Because it resonates.” [Source]</p> <p>The Economist also covered Yang’s taboo-breaking success on the comedy show “Rock and Roast”, and the backlash led by a patriarchal establishment unwilling to share the stage:</p> <p>Long the stars of Chinese joke-making, men are unhappy about being the butt of it. Chizi, a popular male contestant on “Rock and Roast” with a penchant for boorish jokes about women, sniffed that Ms Yang was “not performing comedy”. Guo Degang, a master of xiangsheng, a witty and often bawdy form of traditional comedy involving banter between two people, recently said he would not recruit women for his troupe (“out of respect”, he said). Very few women perform xiangsheng. […] The show, which began in 2017, has been a boost for Chinese stand-up and female participation in it. Evangeline Z says the form of comedy is “huge” in Shanghai. And she reckons up to half of the city’s 50-odd weekly performances are by women. But male and female comics alike warn spectators that what they are about to say could be offensive and they should not take offence. Xiao Ju, a 22-year-old part-time comedian, also in Shanghai, says that showgoers expect to come in for “a bit of easy laughter”, so are ruffled when the ribbing reveals something about themselves. Female comedians elicit stronger reactions from the audience than male ones, says Xiao Ju. Many people are still shocked when women swear on stage. A gag about a prostitute told by a male comic draws tuts if delivered by a woman. “Sex is a perilous topic,” says Xiao Ju. “So are shit, piss and farts. If a man jokes about these, everyone laughs. If a woman does, she is disgusting.” For fear of offending, many stick to crowd-pleasing themes like families and jobs.

925684621,COVID-19 pandemic and the call for fair regulations,2020-05-26 22:07:19,"<p>BY EBUKA EKEANYANWU</p> <p>According to the International Labour Organization, the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed into an economic and labour market shock. Businesses irrespective of size are facing serious challenges such as the threat of significant declines in revenue, insolvencies and job losses in specific sectors. The sustainance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is also expected to be particularly difficult. Reports from the International Labour Organization predicts that the pandemic will have far-reaching impacts on labour market outcomes such as a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the reality in its Labour Market is expected to be much worse, owing to the outdated and grossly insufficient provisions of the Nigerian Labour Act of 2004 which governs labour matters in Nigeria. This paper calls for fair regulations and/or legislations in Nigeria whilst examining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on private labour relationships and exploring the various options available to employers and employees in mitigating the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a party’s exposure to legal liability.</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The Labour Act of 2004 offers merely basic and arguably primitive protection to employees in Nigeria such that its provisions are not in tandem with 21st century realities. The inadequacies of the Act have become manifest in light of the realities occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. While in more advanced climes, employees can expect some form of protection with respect to job securities and benefits, employees in Nigeria are more or less at the mercy of employers. Worse more is that the minimal provisions as encoded in the Labour Act in Nigeria fails to apply to the entirety of the Nigerian labour market.</p> <p>THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT VIS-À-VIS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC</p> <p>The relationship between the employer and the employee is largely a function of the employment contract. As held by the Supreme Court of Nigeria per Muhammad JSC in Iyere v. Bendel Feed and Flour Mill Ltd. the legal basis of employment between the employer and the employee is the contract of employment. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria such as the limitation imposed on movements, closure of non-essential businesses/services and the lockdown pronounced in some states has necessitated an overhaul of the traditional performance of the obligations under the various employment contracts. For example, on the part of the employers, the reduction or outright loss of revenue due to little or no patronage from clients has directly impacted on their ability to sustain their obligations to pay wages to employees; while on the part of employees, the COVID-19 Regulations imposed by the President of Nigeria on March 30, 2020 has through the restrictions on movement, compromised an employee’s ability to present his/her self for work when required. Certainly, an employer may be desirous of relying on the employee’s inability to show up for work as a reason to extinguish liability for not paying wages. However, technological advancements has provided adjustments which both parties can subscribe to, such as teleconferencing, email correspondence, and use of work-issued computers to enable an employee work from home.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Accordingly, where the adjustments as stated above can be reasonably applied, the issue of frustration of contract becomes mute. The Nigerian position on frustration of contract, as held by the Supreme Court per Adekeye JSC in Nwaolisah v. Nwabufoh is that a contract is frustrated when an unforeseen and unexpected event prevents its performance, with neither party being at fault for having caused the event that led to the frustration of the contract. The court set out examples of such events to include: subsequent legal changes or statutory impossibility and literal impossibility .</p> <p>The answer to the question of whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic will frustrate a contract of employment will definitely be case-specific and subject to an objective test such as the possibility of the business being carried on remotely or the practicability and implementation of the WHO Guidelines in the workplace , and whether or not the period of the restrictions caused by the pandemic had an ascertained duration . It is submitted that where the above issues are answered in the affirmative, the contract of employment may not be held to have been frustrated.</p> <p>Force Majeure clauses can also be invoked to extinguish the obligation on the part of an employer to perform his duties as specified in the contract of employment. However, force majeure clauses are contractual, that is, they must be incorporated into the contract of employment. Section 17(1) of the Labour Act which unfortunately is restricted in its application , gives an appearance of statutory flavor to force majeure events by requiring payment of only one-day’s wage in the event of a temporary emergency or circumstances beyond the employer’s control but subjects it to other limitations.</p> <p>Interestingly, there are a variety of options that can be considered by employers and employees to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. They are discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, LAY-OFFS, UNPAID LEAVE AND SHORT-TERM WORK</p> <p>By the provisions of the Section 11 of the Labour Act of 2004 and in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employer may terminate the contract of employment by notice or by payment of salary in lieu of notice. This can effectively be carried out anytime and without any explanation . The employer can also choose to lay off the employee to avoid or at least postpone redundancies</p> <p>Another alternative the employer can explore is Lay off. Laying-off indicates that the employer does not provide the employee with work, with the resultant effect that the employee also does not get paid. It is usually employed for business/economic reasons . A lay-off can be permanent; where permanent, it may likely become subject to the same statutory provisions governing redundancy under the Labour Act or as governed under a contract of employment which may provide for compensation benefits. It can also be temporary, in which case, it is fully subject to the contract of employment entered into by the parties. It is instructive to note that a lay off when permanent is usually the effect of a redundancy exercise; however, redundancy under the Labour Act is defined as the “involuntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of man power”. As such, where a lay off occurs which is not the result of excess man power, the Labour Act will not give protection to such an employee as his/her employment shall be governed strictly in line with the contract of employment as negotiated unilaterally by the employer. This leaves the employee at the mercy of the employer as is the case in any master-servant relationship .</p> <p>Where the lay-off is temporary, it is essentially an unpaid leave. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employers and employees may find the option of unpaid leave to be mutually beneficial. The employee is for all intents and purposes, relieved of his duty to work, and is also not entitled to payment for the period of the leave. This may be beneficial because it reduces cost on the part of an already economically-beleaguered employer and ensures job security for the employee. Sadly however, there is no express provision for unpaid leave in Nigeria.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Also, due to the fact that the Labour Act is silent on the issue of when an employee can take his/her annual leave, employers may arbitrarily by agreement as a result of their enormous bargaining power, unfairly require qualified employees to utilise their annual leave during the period of the lockdown. It is however suggested that a fair renegotiated agreement be reached between the employer and the employee such as, reasonably reducing the number of leave days entitled to an employee in the given year of the lockdown. This may be desirable and fair given the circumstances as there is a need to strike a balance towards ensuring that the employee utilises his/her leave when so desired and the employer makes the best of its resources by limiting the influx of employees utilising their annual leave all at the same time when the lock down is over.</p> <p>Short-term work denotes a diminution in work with a corresponding decrease in remuneration. This appears to be a much preferable approach, as both parties still perform their obligations, albeit, on a reduced scale. Lay-offs and short term work are not clearly contemplated by the provisions of the Labour Act and as such, employees are largely left subject to the terms of their respective contracts with the employers .</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>REDUNDANCY</p> <p>Section 20 of the Labour Act of 2004 defines redundancy as an involuntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of manpower. The section obligates an employer to, in the event of redundancy; inform the trade union or workers’ representative concerned of the reason for and the extent of the anticipated redundancy . The principle “last in, first out” is also expected to be applied, subject to all factors of relative merit including skill, ability and reliability; and is also expected to, using his best endeavors, negotiate redundancy payments to any discharged workers who are not protected by any regulations made by the Minister of Employment, Labour and Productivity with respect to redundancy allowance. However, the position of the National Industrial Court as recently expressed in the case of Urinrin Digun-Aweto v. Ecobank Nigeria Limited is to the effect that for redundancy to be binding in a private contractual relationship, the redundancy policy must be provided for in the contract of employment.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>REDUCTION OF SALARY</p> <p>Due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, most employers have resorted to pay cuts or reduction of the employee’s salary. Employers can adopt pay cuts in response to a corresponding decrease in the amount of work given to the employee or while maintaining the status quo on the amount of work done. These options, including the undesirable second option are available to the employer by reason of the insufficient provisions of the Labour Act. Section 7(1) of the Labour Act obligates an employer to within three months of the worker’s period of employment; provide the worker with a written statement specifying the name of the employer or group of employers, nature of the employers business, period of notice to be given by party wishing to terminate the employment, rate of wages, manner and periodicity of payment of wages, hours of work, amongst others; and where there is to be a change in either of these, the employer shall within a month of the change, inform the worker of the nature of the change by a written statement. The employer does not however, have to comply with the above provision where there is a written contract of employment covering these matters. The reduction will largely be subject to the parties’ freedom to contract which in most cases is dependent on the employer’s terms.</p> <p>However, it is imperative to note that, an employer cannot unilaterally reduce an employee’s salary. Salary reduction can only be done in compliance with the provisions of Section 7 or where such reduction is already envisaged in the contract of employment vide a hardship clause .</p> <p>Renegotiating the Contract of Employment Fairly: The basic requirement for the recognition of an employer-employee relationship is the existence of an enforceable contract of employment. To mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become necessary for the parties to an employment contract to renegotiate the contractual terms. The need for the employer to protect the continued existence of the business must be weighed alongside the employee’s need for job security fairly. Where not already incorporated, the contract should be renegotiated to allow for salary reductions, redundancy packages, short-term work and unpaid leave. It is important to note that these renegotiated contracts are temporary in nature, spanning the duration of the pandemic. Failure to reach a consensus will most certainly lead to termination of employment and/or litigation. This is another area in which the Labour Act of 2004 is grossly insufficient, as employees are subject more or less, to the whims and caprices of employers who have higher bargaining powers.</p> <p>In the United Kingdom, contracts of employment are governed by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 which prevents unreasonable attempts by employers to escape liability by rendering the offending clauses in contracts unenforceable. Therefore, any clause in an employment contract that prevents an employer from performing all or any of his obligations would be unenforceable, unless reasonable and fair. In addition, the employer is not allowed to render any contractual performance different in a substantial manner from that which was reasonably expected of the employee and the employer is also prevented from unreasonably excluding or restricting liability arising from its own breach of contract; and where possible negotiate fair compensation packages with the employee in the given event of a permanent lay off or termination of employment by way of redundancy.</p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>There is an urgent need for a Labour Law that is up to date with 21st century realities that protects employees through wide all-encompassing clauses. This will prevent unreasonable reliance on concepts such as frustration of contracts to terminate contracts of employment unfairly.</p> <p>There is also a need for a statutory flavor in employment contracts to stipulate limitations for contract renegotiation in order to prevent the inclusion of unfair contractual terms and to ensure that employees are not taken advantage of. The Labour Act should also protect the employer’s business where necessary, especially in circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore submitted that Nigeria should emulate the United Kingdom and put in place, relevant legislations that takes care of the issues as highlighted in this article.</p>",3

And yet, despite that vast wealth, there is still a massive tech talent gap. And now there’s a growing trend of tech workers coming together to call for greater unionization in this sector. This is moving beyond petitions and signed letters from staff, to increased walkouts, employee resource groups, and even formal trade unions.</p> <p>On January 4, the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) launched with 230 members, instantly making it the biggest tech union. A few weeks later, the membership of this American and Canadian union, which includes permanent, contracted and vendor company employees of Google, its subsidiaries, and other Alphabet Inc. brands, has quadrupled. Earlier this week, international Googlers across 13 countries formed a coalition of unions called Alpha Global.</p> <p>“Together, we will change Alphabet,” the global alliance commits.</p> <p>But Google employees aren’t the first to want to change their tech companies and we are pretty sure they won’t be the last. So today we reflect on the growing mobilization of people in tech, and try to predict where it’s headed.</p> <p>OK, Google, How’d You Get Here?</p> <p>We write it a lot — if the tech industry is building the future, then we have to be sure what kind of future we’re building. But before it goes cross-industry, any push for change often starts within a company. In tech’s case, it started with Google.</p> <p>“At Google, we have a really long history of employee activism. A decade or more of working together to steer the company in an ethical direction,” Andrew Gainer-Dewar, Google software engineer and spokesperson for AWU, recently told The New Stack.</p> <p>Don’t do evil. Do the right thing. These used to be the mottos for Google. But, in April 2018, when the world learned of the now-infamous Project Maven contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for AI-backed drone feeds, about four percent of the Google staff wrote an open letter to the Alphabet CEO, demanding not only that Google pull out of the contract, but that “Google draft, publicize and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.” In the minds of these Google employees, adding muscle to a war machine could be viewed as doing evil, and they were complicit in this direction (Google declined to interviewed for this story, though provided written commentary and associated resources).</p> <p>“The company is an architect of the new world of work. It is a major incubator of innovations, and as a technology leader, it is a laboratory for new methods of communications and working. Unfortunately, Alphabet is also a creator of inequalities, implicated in sexual harassment and oppression of sexual minorities and people of colour. It is a place where many workers came to change the world — to make it more democratic — only to find Alphabet suppressing speech and cracking down on worker organizing while consolidating monopolistic power.” — Alpha Global</p> <p>Among other things, this letter notably stated — in bold — that the Project Maven affiliation “will irreparably damage Google’s brand and its ability to compete for talent.” This feels pointed, like it was reminding their boss how hard tech talent is to come by. Google decided not to renew its Project Maven contract and even created a new set of AI principles, which specifies that its AI research should not be used for weapons.</p> <p>Now, while Google got rid of the simple statement, “Don’t do evil,” that wittily ended their much more extensive Code of Conduct with: “And remember… don’t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn’t right — speak up!”</p> <p>However, Google’s response to people speaking up has been less than welcoming.</p> <p>In November 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees staged a global walkout to protest the way the company handled sexual harassment and pay inequality, and to end forced arbitration where all lawsuits had to be settled out of court.</p> <p>In September 2019, a group of about 80 Google contract workers who worked on-site in Pittsburgh, in an effort to bargain over wages and working conditions, voted to unionize and join United Steelworkers. The outsourcing company working for Google, in response, started a trend of offshoring that work to Poland, the protesters alleged. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which handles U.S. labor law, has scheduled a hearing.</p> <p>In November 2019, a few more employees were fired for organizing a protest against the company’s work with the U.S. Border Patrol.</p> <p>Then a few weeks later, four employees — hence known as the Thanksgiving Four — were fired, allegedly accused of “breaking security policies” in their efforts to expose Google’s work with notorious union-busting firm IRI Consultants. Of course, this only served to make public Google’s affiliation with IRI public knowledge.</p> <p>The ex-Googlers partnered with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and, in part, successfully petitioned the NRLB to challenge Google. This last December, the NRLB issued a complaint against Google for unlawfully monitoring and questioning several workers who were then fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union.</p> <p>This complaint charged that Google repeatedly violated U.S. labor law by using “terminations and intimidation in order to quell workplace activism.” It also charged that Google’s checking of employee calendars — installing a tool on employees’ web browsers that flagged internal calendar events requiring more than ten meeting rooms or 100 participants — to be “unlawful surveillance.”</p> <p>Google’s official response to this step by the NRLB:</p> <p>“We strongly support the rights our employees have in the workplace, and open discussion and respectful debate have always been part of Google’s culture. We’re proud of that culture and are committed to defending it against attempts by individuals to deliberately undermine it — including by violating security policies and internal systems. The NLRB determined today that Google was justified in terminating three employees who violated our data security policies.</p> <p>“We’ll continue to provide information to the NLRB and the administrative judge about our decision to terminate or discipline employees who abused their privileged access to internal systems, such as our security tools or colleagues’ calendars. Such actions are a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility, and we will be defending our position.”</p> <p>This case will be brought in front of an administrative law judge on April 12.</p> <p>Also last December, Google made headlines and inspired outrage again when it fired then Co-Lead of Google’s Ethical AI team Dr. Timnit Gebru, which Gebru charged was an effort to suppress her research and her internal criticism of Google’s lack of genuine diversity efforts and lack of transparency surrounding both employee and research feedback.</p> <p>On Dec. 4, Jeff Dean, senior fellow and head of Google’s research organization, publicly shared an internal email sent the day before that outlined the chain of events leading up to “her decision to resign from Google.”</p> <p>About 2,700 Googlers have signed a letter standing with Gebru, stating that Gebru’s exit was a termination not a resignation and dubbing Google’s actions “unprecedented research censorship” and the letter includes the following:</p> <p>“Instead of being embraced by Google as an exceptionally talented and prolific contributor, Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing… The termination is an act of retaliation against Dr. Gebru, and it heralds danger for people working for ethical and just AI — especially Black people and People of Color — across Google.”</p> <p>Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also wrote a letter on Dec. 9 saying that the company was opening a review to “assess the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process.” There hasn’t been an official response from Alphabet since.</p> <p>Just this week AWU filed an unfair labor practice charge against Modis Engineering, a subcontractor that provides data center services for Google, on behalf of contractor and AWU member Shannon Wait. Wait was suspended last week after she complained on behalf of herself and other workers about conditions at the center, which includes a prohibition of talk about salaries. According to Wait, workers at the South Carolina Google data center, who often perform heavy manual labor, have seen their daily repairs doubled during the pandemic, increasing safety concerns.</p> <p>And not to just focus on the organizing work of the technical, so-called white-collar staff of Google, up until this month the most significant unionizing effort was back in December 2019 by about 2,300 Google Silicon Valley cafeteria workers. These workers are among Google’s majority shadow workforce, which generally shares in worse, stagnant wages and benefits, while these particular workers live in the wildly expensive Silicon Valley. These service workers were following suit of 500 Facebook cafeteria workers who unionized back in 2017.</p> <p>Still, these cafeteria workers aren’t the majority of Googlers and working for the world’s fifth-richest company is still what many people in tech dream of. So what’s the point of starting a union?</p> <p>Unionization efforts are also taking place within other IT companies.</p> <p>About a year ago, Kickstarter United OPEIU Local 153 was formed. Kickstarter was the first major tech company to unionize, under the chartered goals of “transparency, inclusion, solidarity, accountability, and joy” and of supporting “organizing efforts across the tech industry.”</p> <p>In an industry defined by scrambling for venture capitalist investment, Kickstarter’s employees stood out as reflective of a turning point for tech employee activism — not the impetus, but the first to reveal their plans.</p> <p>OPEIU is taking seriously the commitment we unanimously made at our 2019 convention to organize in the tech sector. Today, we’re officially launching @techunion1010 — a union by & for tech workers. Read our statement on this historic day https://t.co/8tj9fXlB6n #TechWorkers pic.twitter.com/2cOp9LcPbb — OPEIU #PassThePROAct  (@OPEIU) January 25, 2021</p> <p>What’s a White-Collar, Non-Binding Union to Do?</p> <p>The difference is that, while anomalistic for the tech industry, Kickstarter United is a traditional union with collective bargaining power. And the crowdfunding platform has less than 250 employees.</p> <p>There are 250,000 Alphabet employees and contracted workers worldwide. AWU includes everyone from the permanent employees to that shadow workforce, from cloud architects to massage therapists, including staff who could already be in other traditional sector unions.</p> <p>“We are the first wall-to-wall whole company union,” Gainer-Dewer said, which, at the time of the interview, just covered the U.S. and Canada officially through a CWA partnership.</p> <p>Joining AWU is completely voluntary. An Alphabet worker just has to fill out a form and sign a card, and then the union performs an employment check. Dues are one percent of total compensation, which Gainer-Dewer says seems on the low side for affiliated industries.</p> <p>The Alphabet Workers Union is filed as a so-called minority union, which means it can’t leverage collective bargaining. Under U.S. labor law, Alphabet Inc. can ignore the union’s demands until a majority of employees support it. However, there is something to be said about the power in numbers, particularly when tech retention is so directly tied to profits.</p> <p>Google responded to the announcement of AWU in early January, by way of director of people operations Kara Silverstein, with: “We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce. Of course, our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”</p> <p>Gainer-Dewer dubbed this “corporate doublespeak” that Google says they “will continue to engage directly to all employees which they haven’t done in years and will continue not to do.”</p> <p>He said that Alphabet Inc’s “executive strategy has been to pretend we are irrelevant, and aggressive retaliation will be a part of that.”</p> <p>So, without collective bargaining and other big union wins, and when Google has unofficially acted increasingly anti-union and even overtly retaliated against people for organizing, why pay to join AWU?</p> <p>Gainer-Dewer was compelled to get involved in organizing after the Thanksgiving Four fires because, in his words, he witnessed “this escalation from engaging with employees to ignoring employees to really aggressively retaliating. Made me worry the next time no one would or could speak up.”</p> <p>As our short history lesson proves, Alphabet employees have a formed a habit of inner-company activism, but now it’s about making it sustainable.</p> <p>Gainer-Dewer said that while “People have been organizing to stand up to leadership for a very long time, building this kind of sustainable long-term structure to build our organizing capacity is new,” maybe 18 months in the works.</p> <p>He continued, “We are building a structure that can support continued growth and building resilience over time.”</p> <p>Resilience isn’t just referring to momentum, but also, in the past, those who have tried to stand up, without this support infrastructure in place, experienced a lot of burnout.</p> <p>Gainer-Dewer said AWU members are also looking to foster a “resilient capacity to speak with a collective voice, to have all of our members democratically reach consensus on what’s important to us, and to speak up to executives.”</p> <p>While the most significant milestone is AWU growing past 800 members in its first three weeks, it has already seemed to have influenced some of Alphabet Inc’s decision making.</p> <p>After the Jan. 6 insurgence on the U.S. Capitol, AWU criticized Alphabet subsidiary YouTube’s response of just taking down President Donald Trump’s video that seems to have incited the domestic terrorist attack.</p> <p>AWU’s official response called this “lackluster, demonstrating a continued policy of selective and insufficient enforcement of its guidelines against the use of the platform to spread hatred and extremism.”</p> <p>Soon after the union’s statement, YouTube revised its response to offer the Trump account an equivalent of a second strike, which means the account is frozen for at least two weeks.</p> <p>Last week, AWU also responded to the suspension of the corporate access of Margaret Mitchell, AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team, which notably lost Gebru a month earlier.</p> <p>There’s no doubt if nothing else, the formation of this union has the media’s ears open to the concerns of this sub-section of Alphabet employees.</p> <p>Is the Tech Industry on the Cusp of Change?</p> <p>Gainer-Dewer says it feels like a historic moment for tech giants to form unions.</p> <p>He said, “I suspect there are groups of other people at other big tech companies, writing the open letters and doing the petitions.”</p> <p>Just this last week, the union Kickstarter United is affiliate with — the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), AFL-CIO — has announced “the formation of its Tech Workers Union Local 1010, an arm of the union with a mission to raise industry standards and provide all tech workers a better future in their workplaces through collective bargaining.”</p> <p>There are already chapters of the Tech Workers Union in tech hotspots Austin, Boston, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, as well as in Brazil, Italy, the Netherlands, Berlin, London and Bangalore, India. TWU’s definition of a “tech worker” is anyone involved in the tech industry in any capacity, ranging from programmers and designers to product managers to gig workers like Uber drivers and even to students. Google, Microsoft, ASOS, Monzo and Deliveroo are said to be planning to join the London chapter.</p> <p>There is also a movement to unionize tech workers in the Global South.</p> <p>The New Stack looks forward to watching this space to see what comes next when tech turns activist.</p> <p>Feature image by Cytonn Photography on Unsplash.</p>",3
970619400,Belarus dictator Lukashenka seeks to silence the media,2021-02-19 22:05:56,"<p>A Minsk court sentenced journalists Katsiaryna Andreyeva and Darya Chultsovato two years in prison on February 18 in a case that highlights the war against free speech that is accompanying Belarus dictator Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s ruthless crackdown on the country’s six-month pro-democracy uprising.</p> <p>The two young journalists, who both work for the Polish-backed independent Belarusian TV channel Belsat, were convicted on charges of “organizing a demonstration that grossly violates public order.” However, critics of the verdict maintain the journalists were guilty of nothing more than live streaming a peaceful protest staged to commemorate activist Raman Bandarenka, whose death in November 2020 was widely believed to be the result of regime brutality.</p> <p>After months spent in custody, the two journalists were finally brought to court this week. Both protested their innocence. “I want to devote all my energy to the creation of a new Belarus without political repression. I demand an acquittal for myself, for my colleagues, and for the hundreds of political prisoners,” Andreyeva commented in court.</p> <p>There was little attempt to present a credible case against the pair. Instead, Belarusian state prosecutors argued that the live stream filmed by the defendants constituted a source of incitement that fueled “violent protests.” There was an air of inevitability about the subsequent two-year sentences.</p> <p>Subscribe for the latest from BelarusAlert Receive updates for events, news, and publications on Belarus from the Atlantic Council. Email *</p> <p>Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.</p> <p>The convictions provoked an immediate international reaction. US Senator Jim Risch, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted, “It is shameful that dictator Lukashenka has jailed two journalists for the “crime” of filming protests against his fraudulent election in Belarus. These brave women, along with others detained, should be immediately released.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, a statement from the European Union’s External Action Service noted that this latest incident was part of a far broader and increasingly alarming trend of repression in Belarus. “The unacceptable harassment of human rights defenders, media workers, trade union representatives, and defense lawyers has escalated in recent days,” the statement noted. “Yesterday, two Belsat journalists were sentenced to two years imprisonment on groundless charges. Other media workers are facing a similar fate. Such verdicts aim to intimidate and silence journalists and media workers who are simply doing their jobs, as well as to prevent factual information from reaching the Belarusian people and beyond.”</p> <p>Also this week in Minsk, the trial began of another Belarusian journalist, Kaciaryna Barysevich, who is facing charges alongside Belarusian doctor Arciom Sarokin. Both are accused of exposing regime attempts to cover up the killing of activist Raman Bandarenka, with prosecutors bizarrely arguing that the publication of Bandarenka’s medical records constitutes a technical violation of Belarusian privacy laws. Human rights groups expect the trial to be just as farcical as the charges themselves.</p> <p>Repressions against Belarus’s small independent media community have continued in parallel to these court proceedings. Earlier this week, multiple members of the Belarusian Association of Journalists were subjected to dawn raids, with plainclothes law enforcement officers conducting searches of their apartments and confiscating computer equipment.</p> <p>The events of the past week represent the latest escalation in a long-running campaign against media professionals in Belarus. The Belarusian Association of Journalists claims that 97 of its members have been sentenced to a collective total of around 1,200 days in prison since the start of the country’s pro-democracy protest movement in August 2020. This number does not include the many more reporters and independent bloggers who have been detained over the past six months before being released without facing any official charges.</p> <p>Nor are Andreyeva and Chultsova the only journalists to receive significant prison time. There are currently at least 11 Belarusian journalists imprisoned due to their professional activities, along with various bloggers who have incurred the displeasure of the regime.</p> <p>The current challenges facing the media in Belarus are extreme, even by the draconian standards of the 26-year Lukashenka dictatorship. “The situation with press freedom in Belarus has always been hard and the regime has kept independent media in its crosshairs for years,” explains Minsk journalist and Atlantic Council Nonresident Fellow Hanna Liubakova. “However, when the protests began last summer, a very real and nasty war was unleashed against journalists and bloggers in Belarus.”</p> <p>Liubakova argues that while the current efforts to silence the Belarusian opposition are alarming, they may ultimately prove futile. “Lukashenka and his government do not seem to understand that hiding the truth is impossible in today’s technological era,” she notes. “Ordinary citizens post videos or share them with the media. Others leak information or help out in different ways.”</p> <p>This is unlikely to deter Lukashenka from continuing to target media professionals guilty of nothing more than attempting to do their jobs. Belarus is now by any measurement among the most dangerous countries in the region, and likely the entire world, for journalists. Indeed, I myself observed masked security men intimidating journalists by filming them during my own reporting from Minsk last summer. By all accounts, the situation has since deteriorated dramatically.</p> <p>Many in Belarus are hoping that a robust international response to the latest prison sentences can still have a moderating effect on the authorities. “it is crucial to send a strong signal to the Belarusian regime and to Lukashenka personally that this will not be tolerated,” says Liubakova.</p> <p>Vladislav Davidzon is a Nonresident Fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.</p> <p>Further reading</p> <p>The views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.</p> <p>The Eurasia Center’s mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

959732778,Who will compensate and protect workers in Leicester’s garment industry?,2020-12-14 16:39:04,"<p>THIS year has been exceptionally difficult for us all. My city of Leicester has had it particularly tough for two key reasons.</p> <p>We have faced coronavirus restrictions for longer than any other area, which includes not been able to visit each other’s home indoors since the start of the first national lockdown in March 2020 and we have also faced an overdue yet painful resurgence of attention on the scandal in our garment industry.</p> <p>Exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry has been an “open secret” and widely reported and studied for at least a decade, yet successive conservative governments have failed to act.</p> <p>Despite the extended media focus, as the year draws to a close, the central questions remain unanswered — what progress has been made this year, and who is protecting workers in Leicester’s garment industry?</p> <p>Tomorrow, the environmental audit committee — of which I am a member — shall be examining Leicester’s garment industry as part of our follow-up inquiry on fashion sustainability.</p> <p>Shamefully, the government rejected most if not all the recommendations of the committee’s 2019 inquiry entitled Fixing Fashion: Clothing Consumption and Sustainability, which highlighted concerns regarding fast fashion and exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry.</p> <p>After this year’s resurgence of reports and widespread condemnation into the scandal, the government must take its head out of the sand and legislate to protect vulnerable workers.</p> <p>The investigation will include an evidence session with Boohoo Group’s executive chairman, Mahmud Kaman.</p> <p>The recent Levitt inquiry, commissioned by Boohoo itself, found that Boohoo was aware of endemic workers’ rights abuses in Leicester’s garment industry.</p> <p>By procuring garments from companies that routinely under-report hours, force employees to work in buildings that pose a severe fire risk and pay as little as four times lower than the legal minimum wage — BooHoo has been complicit in severe instances of exploitation.</p> <p>Yet it chose to ignore the plight of workers in order to seek ever-higher profits, as sales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have also helped reward BooHoo’s bosses with bonuses worth £150 million.</p> <p>Yet despite being at the centre of this scandal, it is unclear what action BooHoo has taken to end exploitation in their supply chains.</p> <p>For example, it is not clear what steps Boohoo has taken to ensure that its purchasing practices don’t act as a driver for illegal pay and poor conditions.</p> <p>Boohoo must sign the transparency pledge and make all of its supplier details public (at home and abroad).</p> <p>Indeed, it is appalling that Boohoo has not yet published a full list of its suppliers — despite promising to do so.</p> <p>This only begs the question, what is it attempting to hide?</p> <p>As the excellent campaign group Labour Behind the Label argue, Boohoo must also end its behaviour of terminating ties with suppliers without paying back wages.</p> <p>Going further than this, Boohoo should make funding immediately available to ensure that all workers who have enabled their huge profits are fully compensated for years of working at less than half the minimum wage.</p> <p>Beyond Boohoo, the government and regulatory institutions are not doing nearly enough to protect and recompense underpaid workers.</p> <p>Workers are still not being paid at least the minimum wage and remain for years on zero-hours contracts without access to holiday pay, sick pay, meal breaks or time-off pay.</p> <p>There are still grave concerns regarding the illegal use of furlough, double record keeping and unsafe and dangerous work environments.</p> <p>Research carried out by the University of Leicester in 2015 revealed that most garment workers were paid way below the national minimum wage, did not have employment contracts, and were subject to intense and arbitrary work practices.</p> <p>The research calculated that the average wage was approximately £3 per hour and made a conservative estimate that the underpaid wage sum in apparel manufacturing within the East Midlands was around £1 million per week.</p> <p>A more recent study by the British Retail Consortium puts the figure at nearer 2.1 million per week.</p> <p>The workers whose wages have been stolen from them must be recompensed.</p> <p>Serious questions need to be asked about the extent to which some among Leicester textile suppliers have engaged in money laundering and VAT fraud.</p> <p>A recent BBC investigation found that firms in Leicester which supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion had engaged in fraudulent practices, including misleading invoices and cash laundering transactions.</p> <p>This investigation found that £8m had been received by six companies said to be issuing fake invoices to the original wholesaler, which means that as much as £1.6m of VAT was not recovered.</p> <p>As this investigation was only the tip of the iceberg, it is possible that tens or even hundreds of millions of taxes are being avoided across the sector.</p> <p>One of the main reasons why these appalling instances of workplace exploitation in Leicester have been able to exist unchecked, is that 10 years of austerity has severely downgraded our regulatory institutions.</p> <p>The local authority in Leicester has had its central government grant funding cut from £289m in 2010 to £171m in 2019.</p> <p>The government has also slashed the budget of the Health and Safety Executive by £100m, or 46 per cent, since 2010.</p> <p>The budget of HM Revenue and Customs, the body which is meant to enforce the minimum wage, was 40 per cent less in 2016 than in 2000, and staffing levels were reduced by approximately 50 per cent over the same period.</p> <p>In 2020, HMRC’s national minimum wage team remains significantly under-resourced, meaning the risk of inspection is low.</p> <p>The most recent director of labour market strategy states that “the average employer can expect an inspection around once every 500 years.”</p> <p>There are also grave concerns regarding the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), which is dubbed by the government as the leading investigative agency for labour exploitation in Britain.</p> <p>For one thing, between July and August 2020 — the peak of coverage of this crisis — GLAA did not carry out any enforcement action against employers.</p> <p>Yet equally worrying is the fact that investigations carried out previously by GLAA involved joint work with immigration enforcement.</p> <p>For instance, in 2011, Operation Serbal was launched by the UK Border Agency and so called “illegal workers” were arrested in a series of raids on Leicester clothing factories, between May and July 2011.</p> <p>Indeed, this summer saw a noticeable increase in immigration enforcement vans following the recent resurgence in media reports on this scandal.</p> <p>This is as counterproductive as it is callous. As the Trades Union Congress rightly highlights, there is clear evidence that workers are deterred from making complaints as they fear being wrongly referred to immigration enforcement.</p> <p>Joint working should cease and a firewall between immigration enforcement and employment rights enforcement agencies should be established.</p> <p>There must be a switch in focus from immigration status to tackling worker exploitation.</p> <p>Rights are meaningless if they are not properly enforced. The government must urgently reverse the funding cuts to regulatory bodies to ensure the safety and fair pay of those at work.</p> <p>The government could also enhance current regulations by introducing a textile adjudicator (similar to the Groceries Code Adjudicator), which could ensure that payment terms to suppliers are fair, including offering recourse to solution on late order cancellations, delays in payments, unfair or illegal deductions, all of which have a knock-on effect on employment at supplier factories and the ability of suppliers to pay legal wages and provide secure employment.</p> <p>Trade unions are the best line of defence against workplace exploitation, and the government must open the door for their involvement.</p> <p>Unions must be granted access to Leicester workplaces to inform workers about the benefits of union membership and collective bargaining.</p> <p>It also must be made easier for working people to negotiate collectively with their employer, including simplifying the process that workers must follow to have their union recognised by their employer for collective bargaining.</p> <p>The scope of collective bargaining rights must also be widened, and trade unions should be actively involved in labour market inspections.</p> <p>Perhaps a new textile and garment workers union is long overdue to help restore Leicester’s once proud role as the jewel in the crown of British industry.</p> <p>Overall, the lack of progress, made this year, in tackling exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry, mirrors that of the last decade — which is simply not good enough.</p> <p>Private companies like Boohoo, regulatory bodies and — ultimately — the government must start approaching this crisis with the ambition and urgency it demands.</p> <p>Claudia Webbe MP is the Member of Parliament for Leicester East.

November 16, 2020. Sergey Gapon / AFP / Scanpix / LETA</p> <p>On Sunday, Moldova held a second round of voting in its 2020 presidential elections. Opposition candidate Maia Sandu won, becoming the first woman president in the country’s history. Sandu defeated the incumbent head of state, Igor Dodon, who is often referred to as one of Vladimir Putin’s main supporters in the former USSR. Sandu, on the other hand, is considered a pro-EU, anti-corruption candidate .</p> <p>A six-week war in Nagorno-Karabakh has ended disastrously for Armenia. Judging by the map, the situation on the ground will revert mostly to the conditions in place before Yerevan’s 1991 war with Baku, leaving Azerbaijani artillery perched just outside the breakaway republic’s capital city and the 50,000 souls who call it home. The big difference this time around is the presence of Russian peacekeepers — about 2,000 of them — who will be there to monitor a Kremlin-brokered truce. Not formally part of the trilateral settlement but still very much involved in the conflict is Turkey, which is expected to field its own monitors in Azerbaijan, albeit outside the Karabakh region.</p> <p>For a better understanding of the violence that took place in this area since late September, and to explore what it means to have won or lost in this war, “The Naked Pravda” turned to three experts: Neil Hauer (a Canadian journalist based in the Caucasus who’s reported extensively on conflicts in Georgia, Syria, and Nagorno-Karabakh), Richard Giragosian (the director of the Regional Studies Center, an independent think tank based in Armenia), and Rob Lee (a former Marine engineer officer and a current doctoral student at King’s College London).</p> <p>Opinion and analysis</p> <p>In an op-ed for Republic, columnist and former diplomat Vladimir Frolov makes a spirited defense of Russia’s actions in Nagorno-Karabakh, swatting away criticisms from Western analysts, Russia’s opposition, and Kremlin loyalists who argue that Moscow emboldened its enemies and betrayed its “Christian allies.” Frolov describes the trilateral settlement announced on November 10 as compatible with Russia’s new “strategic restraint” (see Meduza’s October 29, 2020, newsletter), explaining that the peacekeeping contingent deployed to Azerbaijan is a relatively small risk for big rewards (ending the bloodshed, blocking France and America without shutting them out of the peace process entirely, and bolstering Russian influence in the South Caucasus). Frolov also emphasizes that the Kremlin carefully avoided overcommitting in the region, aware that there’s little public support for a major intervention.</p> <p>At the same time, Frolov acknowledges that Putin pledged and deployed troops to Karabakh on flimsy legal grounds, using the Federation Council’s permission for Russian intervention in Syria as a free pass to send troops anywhere at any future time. The status of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region itself, meanwhile, hasn’t been resolved, and Yerevan, Baku, and Moscow all apparently expect different things here, ranging from the fantasy of independence, the lands’ total Azerbaijani subjugation, and a multiconfessional hodgepodge guarded indefinitely by Russian peacekeepers.</p> <p>For the foreseeable future, Armenian sovereignty has been reduced to something like Abkhazia’s, says Frolov, who also argues that Moscow doesn’t want to see Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan ousted in another coup and replaced with hardliners who would seek to undo “Putin’s Plan” in Karabakh by restarting the war. Despite vitriol in the media about Pashinyan belonging to George Soros, he’s now beholden to Vladimir Putin more than anyone, for his political future and perhaps his very life, Frolov says.</p> <p>In an op-ed for Novaya Gazeta, deputy chief editor Andrey Lipsky says there’s a chance for improved U.S.-Russian relations with President Biden, though Moscow can expect the return of traditional Democratic (big “D”) rhetoric on human rights. Joe Biden is also more committed to Eastern Europe’s struggles against Russian influence, which will restore some of America’s interest in Ukraine and the Baltic states, for example.</p> <p>When it comes to sanctions, Washington may have exhausted all its options, short of a mutually painful escalation that might be justifiable only if Russia continues its bad behavior internationally.</p> <p>On the other hand, a breakthrough could be possible in arms control negotiations, which diplomats could perhaps build on to reach talks on cyber-defense. A cyber treaty could go a long way, argues Lipsky, to normalizing bilateral relations and boosting the role of experts in a field overcrowded by “propagandists and hawks.”</p> <p>In an article for Mediazona, journalist Maxim Litavrin catalogs the largely undocumented spread of coronavirus through Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service , which has been extremely reluctant to release data to the public or confirm outside reports of infections. For this information, Litavrin relies on members of public monitoring commissions who visit prisons to speak to inmates and observe living conditions, as well as other human rights activists, journalists, and inmates’ lawyers and relatives.</p> <p>In a pattern that repeats across the country, Russia’s prison officials have apparently avoided diagnosing likely COVID-19 cases, left prisoners to handle the illness on their own, and refused to disclose test results. Since the start of the pandemic, Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service has acknowledged only about 1,600 coronavirus infections, including just a single, solitary death. (For comparison, at the time of this writing, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has recorded 3,336 COVID-19 cases and 140 deaths among inmates.)</p> <p>Historian Alexander Abalov and economist Vladimir Inozemtsev have a new book which they vow is built on “historical facts and the logic of state development,” according to Republic. An excerpt published online makes it apparent that Abalov and Inozemtsev embrace a grand view of “facts and logic.” In the text available at Republic, the two authors argue that Russian elites have “Muscovized” the country’s post-Soviet development by trying to resurrect the most stagnating, repressive aspects of Russia’s imperial past , which lack even the great ambitions of peak imperialism in the Tsarist and Soviet eras.</p> <p>Abalov and Inozemtsev say Russia’s post-Soviet leaders have abandoned the USSR’s late emphasis on human capital as the driver of economic progress and shifted their focus to sectors that could be consolidated in the state’s hands and controlled with the minimal involvement of most society. All states extract and redistribute rents, Abalov and Inozemtsev admit, but these actions by Russia’s modern-day petrostate are conducted chiefly to serve the elites’ material interests rather than improve the public good. The justifications offered for this process, the authors claim, are “irrational” ideas about “national expediency.”</p> <p>In their assessment of Russia’s post-Soviet trajectory, Abalov and Inozemtsev settle on a version of path dependency, arguing that the elites’ efforts to revive Muscovite and Russian imperial practices were both “quite natural and apparently inevitable,” as well as the result of a variety of factors, ranging from popular expectations, elites’ commercial interests, and objective economic trends, which they say makes it wrong to attribute the imperialist revival to a few random personal factors. If this turn was predetermined, however, Russia’s future is up for grabs, they say. Moscow lacks the strength economically and socially to serve as the post-imperial consolidation point it wants to be, meaning that Russia’s current economic system isn’t a post-Soviet endpoint. In other words, another major destabilization with unpredictable results lies ahead.</p> <p>Other news in brief</p> <p> Suing Putin’s mouth.

The philosopher Mencius said a ruler could lose his “mandate of heaven” if he neglected his responsibility to care for the ordinary people.</p> <p>These beliefs, still widespread, should concern China’s modern-day emperor, Xi Jinping, as the country battles a coronavirus epidemic and braces for an invasion of locusts.</p> <p>“He’s got an enemy that, for the first time, is absolutely uncontrollable, in a state that has always ruled by control,” said the Asia Society’s Orville Schell. “You can’t imprison a coronavirus or get it to undergo ‘thought reform.’ ”</p> <p>Yet the recent introduction of coronavirus-related surveillance measures, many of them unlikely to disappear when the epidemic is over, has also given Xi an opening to assert even tighter control over society.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Drones with cameras chase grandmas down rural roads if they’re spotted not wearing a mask, calling out to them in a robotic voice. Apps enable users to pinpoint the nearest virus case to within 10 yards.</p> <p>Since ascending to the top jobs in China’s political and military hierarchy in 2012, Xi has moved to make himself the strongest leader since Mao Zedong, the founder of this Communist state. He unleashed an anti-corruption campaign to purge rivals and presided over an Orwellian expansion of the surveillance state.</p> <p>Two years ago he scrapped term limits, effectively enabling him to stay in power indefinitely, and this year, he has been styling himself as the “People’s Leader,” a term last applied to Mao.</p> <p>But with China’s death toll from the coronavirus nearing 3,000, Xi faces an unprecedented challenge to his leadership.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“When things get out of kilter, heaven expresses its disfavor,” said Schell, citing the Chinese philosopher Mencius. “Xi has been stripped of his air of invincibility and that is calling into question his ‘mandate of heaven.’ ”</p> <p>The party’s botched response to the virus has pierced Xi’s armor in multiple ways. His admission that he knew about the outbreak by Jan. 7, two weeks before China activated its emergency response, directly implicated Xi in the initial coverup.</p> <p>The outbreak has derailed his political and economic agenda by forcing the party to postpone its showcase annual meetings, where cadres rubber-stamp Xi’s plans for the year. Economists say the shutdown of swaths of the country will hammer growth.</p> <p>More concerning for Xi will be the criticism that has burst into the open, notably with the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Dissent on Chinese social media is quickly erased by the party’s censors, but Chinese-language discussion forums hosted overseas are full of comments about Xi being “gutless” for not going to Wuhan, displaying “tedious” leadership and being an “autocrat.”</p> <p>Two prominent intellectuals who have criticized him have disappeared, apparently detained by security services.</p> <p>Xu Zhiyong, a legal scholar and public intellectual, went into hiding before publishing an essay Feb. 4 in which he called Xi “clueless and hopeless” and urged him to step down. Still, he was detained shortly after.</p> <p>Tsinghua University professor Xu Zhangrun is thought to be under house arrest after he wrote that the coronavirus epidemic “has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance; the fragile and vacuous heart of the jittering edifice of state has thereby shown up as never before.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Chinese journalists who have tried to do independent reporting have vanished, most recently Li Zehua, an anchor for the state broadcaster who resigned so he could be a “citizen reporter” in Wuhan.</p> <p>The party has been battling to hide its missteps.</p> <p>“With the failure of the central authority to provide even very basic public health information to the public, I think there’s now a lot more skepticism of the party,” said Victor Shih of the University of California at San Diego.</p> <p>All of this has led to predictions — including from Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass — that the coronavirus could bring about a change in the way the party operates and may compel it to be more transparent and responsive to the population. Some columnists have characterized the epidemic as China’s “Chernobyl moment,” a tipping point that precipitates the end of Communist rule akin to the nuclear disaster that hastened the demise of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>But the opposite is likely true, at least in the near term.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“The novel coronavirus has exposed flaws in Xi’s autocracy: the control on information, the absence of civil society and the lack of transparency have all had human costs,” said Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat in China who is now at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think tank.</p> <p>“But rather than prompt a rethink in Beijing, Xi and China’s leaders are more likely to double down on the most repressive elements of the regime.”</p> <p>With new cases dropping and the World Health Organization praising their response, China’s leaders are likely to feel vindicated, Kassam said.</p> <p>In addition to effectively putting tens of millions of people under house arrest to contain the outbreak, China’s authorities have harnessed the tools of their techno-authoritarian surveillance state in the name of stopping the epidemic.</p> <p>More than 200 cities across China have adopted “Alipay Health Code,” a QR code that runs through the payment app operated by tech giant Alibaba’s financial division. Alipay is now working, at the government’s behest, to take the service nationwide.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>People are assigned a green, orange or red code, according to their risk of having the coronavirus, and must scan green codes before they can enter stores or restaurants, or take public transportation — an electronic passport for daily life.</p> <p>The code syncs with payment and messaging apps but in Hangzhou, Alibaba’s hometown, the code can even be linked to a person’s social insurance and medical records, according to local reports. It will soon be required to enter office buildings, factory sites and technology parks.</p> <p>The New York Times reported that the software’s code shares data, including the user’s location, with the police.</p> <p>Some officials and experts are talking of keeping these new systems in place after the epidemic, adding them to the arsenal of tech tools at Chinese authorities’ disposal. The government has already promoted a “social credit” system aimed at monitoring and evaluating people’s activities in society, similar to a financial credit score.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Hangzhou’s Communist Party secretary, Zhou Jiangyong, has praised the technology and said the city should look at ways to use such tools more widely.</p> <p>“We must forge ahead along this path with resolve,” Zhou said Monday, while hailing the development of the QR health code.</p> <p>Continuing to require health-code scans will “increase the efficiency and lower costs for health-care services” after the outbreak, said Zhou Tao, a professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.</p> <p>But human rights advocates outside China and ordinary people inside the country have voiced concerns. “I feel very uncomfortable about this kind of snooping,” one person wrote using a pseudonym on the Weibo microblogging site.</p> <p>By deploying traditional measures of political control — including censorship, arresting dissidents and citizen journalists, nationalistic propaganda, and tighter surveillance — Xi has strengthened his hand, said Elizabeth Economy, director of Asian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a book about Xi.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“But this is a short-term victory,” she said. “Over the long term, these actions have the effect of corroding the Communist Party’s legitimacy among the Chinese people. At some point after the virus subsides, Chinese citizens and the rest of the world will likely demand a full accounting of what transpired.”</p> <p>Still, the coronavirus crisis is unlikely to produce a fundamental change in the way that Xi does business, or to precipitate a return to a more collective style of leadership.</p> <p>“His approach to governance is rooted in an extraordinary degree of personal and party control,” Economy said, “and he has little interest in opening space for civil society to act independently.”</p> <p>GiftOutline Gift Article</p>",3

980977032,Mauritius: ICT Act - How the government is taking another shot at censoring social media,2021-04-21 09:28:13,"<p>The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) has released a consultation document about the government's plans to give it more power to censor social media, naming Facebook specifically in the document. Here is why the plan is part of an older strategy to clamp down on the internet and why its claims that this is about cybercrime - rather than censorship - are not convincing.</p> <p>The strategy</p> <p>The document released by the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) seeks to set up a National Digital Ethics Committee (NDEC) with an enforcement unit empowered to take down and censor social media posts. To make its plan work, the document proposes allowing the government to set up a proxy ""to segregate from all incoming and outgoing internet traffic in Mauritius, social media traffic, which will then need to be decrypted, re-encrypted and archived for inspection purposes as and when required"".</p> <p>The plan, the document argues, will help fight cybercrime in social media by allowing the government to retain a record of social media posts and track down who posted them. Governments wanting a measure of control over new communication platforms is nothing new.</p> <p>Back in the early 1990s, the US government wanted telecom firms to allow them to eavesdrop on mobile phones by inserting chips in them accessible to law enforcement in the name of national security. By 1996, that plan was abandoned.</p> <p>Now its social media and governments across the globe have generally looked to three strategies of trying to control social media. The first is by simply blocking off social media sites (or the internet entirely).</p> <p>This has been done in states such as Uganda, Congo-Brazzaville and Chad (particularly during elections or times of unrest). But it's not just Africa that's guilty of that; according to the Internet Shutdown Tracker, India shut down the internet at various parts of the country no less than 106 times just in 2019, topping the global list in internet shutdowns.</p> <p>Pressure social media companies</p> <p>The second strategy is to pressure social media companies themselves to censor at the behest of governments. In 2018 Germany introduced a law mandating social media firms to take down illegal content within 24 hours, as did Australia in April 2019. The European Union is currently in the midst of harmonizing laws across its member-states to tackle copyright infringement on social media. In January this year, Russia passed a law forcing social media companies to censor content deemed illegal by the government.</p> <p>The third approach is to set up regulatory agencies to curb social media, this is the case in the UK, France and India, each of which is in the midst of setting up such bodies.</p> <p>What the ICTA is proposing falls within this latter category of strategies. But it goes further, the proposal allow ICTA itself to take down social media posts. ""In other states the debate on this is still raging and has been for years, so how can Mauritius just decide in 20 days, the middle of a pandemic, on how best to regulate social media?"" asks Rajen Narsinghen, senior legal lecturer at the University of Mauritius.</p> <p>Except of course, that the idea of giving the government the power to decide what does, or does not, appear on social media is not as new as all that.</p> <p>Old wine, new document</p> <p>The ICTA document is neither new nor shocking. But rather just the latest attempt in a long-term effort by the government to clamp down on social media. Starting in 2017, the government toyed with the idea of giving itself the power to ban websites and social media posts by amending current Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act (CMCA).</p> <p>The drafting instructions to the Attorney General's Office were even put up on the ICT Ministry's website. The rationale was to clamp down on fake news online. The problem was that the plan was derailed after the Law Reform Commission in September 2018 rejected the idea.</p> <p>While it called for tightening specific laws dealing with specific cybercrimes, regarding giving the power to the government to determine what and what was not fake news (and what could be published online) it had this to say; ""The main danger to enact such legislation is that it poses a threat to freedom of expression, as it can be used, among other things, to gag dissenting voices. Indeed, decreeing a legal duty of ""truth"" would create a dangerous instrument of control journalistic activities; allowing public officials to decide what amounts to truth is equivalent to accepting that the forces in power have a right to silence views they disagree with, or beliefs that they do not share.""</p> <p>The LRC has reason to be wary. In June that same year, the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that, ""Encryption establishes, among other things, a measure of privacy that enables individuals to search the web, develop opinions and access information online. It may secure the traffic of emails, instant messages and other modes of digital communication so that individuals may express themselves freely"".</p> <p>Any interference in such communications, the UN added, should only be done on a case-by-case basis and only when ordered by a court. A far cry from the blanket powers the ICTA is looking to give itself now.</p> <p>In 2018, the government had to settle for watering down the provisions of the Information and Communication Technologies Act by amending it by widening what constituted a cybercrime ('causing distress') and reversing the burden of proof on those posting online to prove their innocence making prosecuting cybercrimes easier.</p> <p>This is to say that ICTA's latest proposals are just another episode in the ever-tightening grip of the government over social media.</p> <p>ICTA's credibility</p> <p>One of the biggest problems with the ICTA's proposals is that the regulator has precious little credibility when it comes to deciding what is, and is not, cybercrime and prosecuting it. In the Rachna Seenauth case in April last year, for example, the secretary of an ex-President was arrested for sharing a joke on social media poking fun at Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth.</p> <p>That was on a complaint by Kaushik Jadunundun, then a politically appointed board member of ICTA who boasted on Facebook that he did it ""for my boss and my country"". That was before Jadunundun himself was arrested and forced to leave the ICTA, board after he himself was accused of defamatory posts. Seenauth's affidavit notes that she received a message from Dick Ng Sui Wa, the Chairman of ICTA telling her that her post was ""not alright"".</p> <p>Also arrested last year for poking fun at the prime minister was ex-ambassador Ravin Lochun. There is an irony here, the government that now looks to squeeze out fake news, itself benefited from doctored videos in the last election campaign and a vast social media campaign against its opponents. ""There are double standards here,"" says Narsinghen.</p> <p>Is it about law and order?</p> <p>ICTA reassured everybody in a communique yesterday that its proposals would only affect public messaging platforms such as Facebook. In its consultation document it listed statistics about cybercrime: 2,051 incidents reported between January 2020 and January 2021.</p> <p>One reason these proposals are necessary, ICTA insisted was because, ""in Mauritius, when offensive and abusive online content is posted in the native Kreol language, in the majority of cases, complaints made by local authorities to the social media administrators remain unattended or are not addressed in a timely manner."" In other words, social media companies are unwilling or unable to help stamp out cybercrime on social, forcing ICTA to give itself the power to do so.</p> <p>But how much of this is about cybercrime really? What kind of requests about cybercrime from the Mauritian government have these social media companies been ignoring? Luckily, they too publish figures.</p> <p>According to Google's Transparency Report, since 2016 it has received 13 requests from Mauritius, eight of which were from the government, to take down 29 web pages, out of which no less than 20 were for allegedly criticizing the government or for defaming government figures. Only one had anything to do with actual cybercrime, in this case, copyright infringement. Six of these were videos on social media.</p> <p>Posts criticizing the government</p> <p>Let's take Facebook. According to its own reports, between 2017 and 2019 the Mauritian government demanded information on seven user accounts. Once again, for posts criticizing the government or government figures. None of these requests were honored. At least according to Google and Facebook.</p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mauritius Media By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Or Wakashio, without social media nobody would have known what was going on and civil society would not have been mobilized"".</p> <p>For him the dangers are clear: ""For six years now the government has been making it harder to fight controversial building projects impacting the environment, leaving recourse only to the Supreme Court"". He adds that the decision to de-proclaim Pomponette beach has been going since 2016 at court and may only now start formal hearings. ""Social media is one of the key tools left for environmental rights, which have been shrinking in recent years, we need it to raise consciousness and to communicate with outside bodies and other environment NGOs. They are opening the door to something dangerous here"".</p> <p>This ICTA proposal is appearing after 2020 saw the government face a series of social media-fuelled protests over its mishandling of Covid-19, Wakashio and the Kistnen case. This is the key context here.</p> <p>The problem is that the government can easily transform ICTA's proposals into reality. The ICTA proposal says simply it can all be done by amending its enabling legislation. ""They can pass it as an ordinary bill, so they just need a simple majority in parliament, which they have"" argues Narsinghen,</p> <p>""Of course given its implications it can be challenged in court for breaching constitutional protections to freedom or expression and the right to privacy"". In lieu of a lengthy court case and a lockdown, ironically, the only way to challenge ICTA's proposals is online. Precisely the type of activity the proposals from ICTA are putting in peril.</p>",3
1022001228,Critical reporting lands 3 journalists in jail in Somaliland,2022-01-05 21:15:31,"<p>People stand next to the Independence Monument, depicting a hand holding a map of the country, in the city of Hargeisa, Somaliland, 19 September 2021, EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP via Getty Images</p> <p>Journalists Abdifatah Mohamed Abdi, Hamse Abdi Ahmed and Abdikhadar Farah Abshir arrested for their critical reporting of regional authorities.</p> <p>This statement was originally published on cpj.org on 31 December 2021.</p> <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists today called on authorities in the breakaway region of Somaliland to unconditionally release three journalists detained for reporting critically on the administration of the Sool region, and to guarantee that the media can cover politics without retaliation.</p> <p>On December 26, police in Las Anod, the capital of the Sool region, arrested Abdifatah Mohamed Abdi, a reporter with the Facebook and YouTube-based outlet Holhol Media, according to a Facebook post by Holhol Media as well as Sakaria Ahmed Muhumed, chairperson of the Somaliland Journalists Association (SOLJA), a local press rights group. On December 30, police in Las Anod arrested two other journalists – Hamse Abdi Ahmed, a freelancer, and Abdikhadar Farah Abshir, a reporter with the privately owned Universal TV, according to Sakaria, and a Las Anod-based journalist, who requested anonymity for safety concerns. Both spoke to CPJ via messaging app.</p> <p>Sakaria told CPJ that the three journalists were detained in connection with interviews of members of the public about the track record of Sool governor Abdikarin Adan Haji Diriye. On December 26, Abdifatah, Khadar, and Hamse posted three similar reports to their Facebook accounts, where they each have at least 4,000 friends or followers. CPJ reviewed the version of the report published by Abdifatah on his page, in which he interviewed people who expressed critical views about the governor, some of whom called for his replacement.</p> <p>“The media have a duty to give voice to members of the public who wish to express dissenting or controversial views. This is journalism, and not a crime,” said CPJ sub-Saharan African representative, Muthoki Mumo. “Authorities in Somaliland should unconditionally release Abdifatah Mohamed Abdi, Abdikhadar Farah Abshir, and Hamse Abdi Ahmed, and ensure that the press can cover politics without fear of retaliation.”</p> <p>In the days after Abdifatah was arrested, Hamse and Abdikhadar continued to publish posts that were critical of the Sool administration, according to CPJ’s review of their Facebook pages. Sakaria told CPJ that as of December 31, the three journalists were held at the Central Police Station in Las Anod and had yet to be produced in court.</p> <p>Yasmin Omar Haji Mohamoud, the chairperson of the local NGO Human Rights Centre Somaliland, told CPJ via messaging app that three of the members of the public interviewed in Abdifatah’s report had also been arrested and remained in custody as of December 31.</p> <p>Sool authorities have detained Abdifatah before for his political reporting. On October 24, he was arrested by police in Las Anod and released in early November, according to a statement issued by the Human Rights Centre, and a Facebook post by Abdifatah at the time.</p> <p>Governor Abdikarin disconnected a phone call on December 30, shortly after being asked about Abdifatah’s detention. He did not answer subsequent messages from CPJ requesting comment on the detention of the three journalists.</p> <p>CPJ’s emails to the office of the Somaliland president, the ministry of justice, the ministry of interior, the ministry of foreign affairs, and the ministry of information either were not immediately answered or returned error messages. CPJ’s phone calls to these ministries did not connect, and messages sent via Facebook and Twitter did not receive immediate responses.</p> <p>Somaliland attorney general Hasan Aden’s phone was switched off when CPJ called today and a message delivered to his WhatsApp account is yet to be answered.</p>",3
1006292214,UN expert likens Belarus to ‘totalitarian’ states,2021-07-05 00:00:00,"<p>Special Rapporteur Anais Marin warns Human Rights Council that Minsk is moving to ‘purge’ Belarus of all dissent.</p> <p>A top UN expert has likened Belarus to “totalitarian states”, warning that Minsk’s recent grounding of a passenger plane and subsequent arrest of an opposition journalist on board was part of an ongoing effort by officials to “purge” the country of all dissent.</p> <p>Anais Marin, the United Nations’ special rapporteur on the rights situation in the country, told the Human Rights Council on Monday the incident in May “illustrates the desire of authorities to end all forms of dissidence by purging society of elements it considers undesirable”.</p> <p>“It is a form of purge that recalls those practised by totalitarian states,” she said in a speech at the Geneva-based forum.</p> <p>On May 23, Belarusian authorities diverted a Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania and forced it to land in Minsk, which was followed by the arrest of Lukashenko critic Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend.</p> <p>Marin added the rights situation was “deteriorating” in Belarus, which was rocked by months of protests late last year following longtime President Alexander Lukashenko’s re-election in an August vote that was widely denounced by his opponents as rigged but handed the 66-year-old a sixth term in office.</p> <p>Authorities responded to the demonstrations with a massive crackdown that saw thousands of people arrested and reports of police brutality. Most of Lukashenko’s opponents are now either in jail or have fled the country.</p> <p>‘Serious’ rights violations</p> <p>Marin, who was presenting her latest report to the council, decried that the “already catastrophic situation” in Belarus she had highlighted the last time she spoke before the UN’s top rights body in September had since significantly worsened.</p> <p>She pointed out that three of Lukashenko’s opponents during last year’s election remained behind bars, and that they were among some 530 people currently considered to be prisoners of conscience in the country.</p> <p>Over the past year, Marin said more than 35,000 people had been arbitrarily detained for simply exercising their right to assemble peacefully or their solidarity with the victims of rights abuses.</p> <p>Thousands more had been subjected to violence, humiliation and intimidation by law enforcement officers, she said, adding that she had received information indicating that torture of the detained was all but “systematic”.</p> <p>“These extremely serious violations have led to no prosecution in Belarus,” she said, decrying “persistent impunity” in the country.</p> <p>US threatens further sanctions</p> <p>Marin’s remarks came as Washington’s delegate to the Human Rights Council hinted at the possibility of further economic sanctions against Belarus in a strongly worded speech on Monday.</p> <p>The United States announced targeted sanctions against key members of the Belarusian government after the plane incident.</p> <p>“Such contempt for international norms cannot go unanswered,” the US delegate said on Monday, describing the incident as “sickening”.</p> <p>“We will consider further actions as necessary,” he added, in reference to sanctions.</p> <p>The European Union, United Kingdom and Canada have all also imposed sanctions on Lukashenko and his allies.</p> <p>Minsk has reacted angrily to the moves, saying they “border on the declaration of an economic war”.</p>",3
874915100,What Trump’s asylum ban will mean for the thousands waiting at the US-Mexico border,2019-09-24 11:27:36,"<p>The Trump administration’s latest restrictive immigration policy, known as the asylum ban, was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p> <p>The ban effectively ends asylum relief for the vast majority of refugees seeking it at the U.S.-Mexico border. It prevents individuals from applying for asylum in the United States if they could have pursued asylum in another country first.</p> <p>There are few exceptions: (1) if you lose your asylum claim in a third country, or (2) if you only passed through the few countries who are not parties to certain United Nations refugee conventions. None of these countries are located in Central America, through which the many refugees travel on their way to the U.S.</p> <p>As a scholar of immigration law, I can state with authority that – unlike other policies – this particular move will likely result in the death, kidnapping and torture of individuals seeking safety from persecution and torture in their home countries.</p> <p>Asylum-seekers’ journeys</p> <p>Asylum-seekers at the southern border come from all over the world, not only Central America.</p> <p>Before I became a law professor, I worked as a staff attorney at Human Rights Initiative of North Texas, a legal services nonprofit in Dallas, Texas. There, I represented dozens of asylum-seekers in both affirmative and defensive asylum claims during the Bush and Obama administrations.</p> <p>The vast majority of our clients entered through the southern border. They were fleeing violence from every corner of the world: Eritrea, Egypt, Iran, Chad, Cuba, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Nepal – and yes, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, too.</p> <p>Last summer, I led an effort to provide legal information regarding credible fear interviews to over 300 asylum-seekers transferred straight from the southern border to a county jail in Albany, New York. They came from 39 different countries and spoke 19 different languages.</p> <p>To qualify for asylum in the United States, an individual must show that they have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution in the future on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.</p> <p>Courts have interpreted membership in a particular social group to include claims involving persecution due to gender, sexual orientation, family affiliation and other types of persecution that the government cannot or will not prevent.</p> <p>One of my former clients, a human rights worker from a country in Africa, narrowly escaped death after having been imprisoned and tortured by her own government. She swam across the Rio Grande to seek safety in the United States after catching a flight to Central America and making her perilous journey north. She was eight months pregnant. When she arrived in our office with her husband, also a refugee and also a client, she was days away from giving birth and in crippling distress.</p> <p>Months later, after giving birth, she and her husband, were granted asylum by an immigration judge. They might not be alive today had the U.S. government not protected them.</p> <p>New struggles under the ban</p> <p>Under the asylum ban, individuals like my client are less likely to survive.</p> <p>First, upon arriving at the border, asylees are subjected to another Trump-era policy implemented on January 25: the “remain in Mexico” policy, which requires them to wait in line in Mexico with thousands of other migrants until it is their turn to request asylum.</p> <p>If they avoid the rape, beatings, kidnappings and ransom that have plagued those waiting in Mexico, a new fate awaits them. They might make it to the front of the line, only to be turned away under the new policies. Immigration judges presiding remotely over closed hearings from the United States can decide that under the new policy, an individual is required to seek asylum in one of the countries they passed through before arriving in Mexico.</p> <p>Let’s say that country is Guatemala, one of the countries that asylees traveling by land from anywhere in Central or South America must pass through in order to reach Mexico. The U.S. State Department indicates that Guatemala “remains among the most dangerous countries in the world,” due to “endemic poverty, an abundance of weapons, a legacy of societal violence, and the presence of organized criminal gangs.”</p> <p>This small, troubled country now has a long line of asylum applications to process, which it is already ill-equipped to do. Guatemala’s asylum system has been characterized by immigration experts as “embryonic.” As of Aug. 2, its four asylum officers had not resolved any of the 423 cases awaiting a decision.</p> <p>Many asylees will likely face difficulty traveling back to Guatemala, El Salvador or other common waypoints. Even if they did, they would find no protection there and little chance to survive in a country struggling to keep its own citizens safe.</p> <p>Legal challenges</p> <p>Many of the over 10,000 migrants waiting at the border – whose numbers are growing daily – face similar dangers.</p> <p>Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported on the kidnapping of a family of four awaiting their chance to seek asylum. That story cited a human rights report cataloging more than 110 cases of violent crimes against asylum-seekers waiting as a result of the “Remain in Mexico” policy, during observations of hearings at the border in June and July.</p> <p>So far, lawsuits challenging this ban have failed. The most recent legal challenge, filed on Sept. 16, is on behalf of more than 100 migrant mothers and children directly impacted by the asylum ban.</p> <p>That lawsuit documents and challenges the inconsistent implementation of the policy. For example, the first step in articulating an asylum claim at the border is a process called a “credible fear interview.” Under the asylum ban, individuals have not been provided legal orientation regarding the new processes for these interviews. Some have been subjected to multiple interviews over long periods of time. Meanwhile, untrained border patrol officers, rather than trained asylum officers, are now conducting the interviews.</p> <p>As renewed legal challenges make their way through the courts, I fear that families will continue disappearing, violent attacks on refugees will increase, and the human toll will be irreversible.</p> <p>[ Deep knowledge, daily.

895289807,BOKO HARAM RENEWED ATTACKS,2019-12-27 00:00:00,"<p>The new attacks by Boko Haram on communities of Yobe and Borno States are worrisome and major setback to the counter terrorism effort. There was a misunderstanding between Abubakar Shekau camp and that of the son of the late Muhammad Yusuf in March 2015 which gave birth to ISWAP, a Jihadist terrorist organization active in the Lake Chad Basin Areas.</p> <p>I came across the name in 2015 when a renowned terrorism reporter and a journalist Ahmed Salkida tweeted on his twitter handle that Boko Haram splinted into major groups. The group at that time seemed to be nonviolent; their modus operandi is like humanitarian workers helping the extreme or poor communities with water, shelter and other basic amenities. The group was doing so to create trust with the host communities and also create avenue of recruiting more young people into their group.</p> <p>The group is reported to have a strong allegiance with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The group appears to be working hard to gain more favour and support from ISIS, though they do provide training and technical assistance to them.</p> <p>Recently, the group executed four aid workers who were abducted on 18 July 2019 in Damasak in Borno State. They are in custody of the one woman among the aid workers and some other people including the lecturers from Adamawa. The group is kidnapping people and demanding for ransom which is one of its sources of finance.</p> <p>In November, Nigerian Air Force successfully targeted the senior members of the group and killed several of them in Jubilaram in the Lake Chad Basin. The operation, according to Air force spokesperson was part of the renewed offensive to end the protracted insurgency in the region.</p> <p>The renew attacks are very disturbing and came at a time the government is claiming that the group has been defeated technically. This month, the group has made several attacks at different locations in Borno and Yobe States. The group reported that they ambushed travellers along Maiduguri-Monguno road where six people were killed, an eye witness said four of them were humanitarian workers. Another one was in Damaturu where the Nigerian army successfully pushed them back and killed many of them. After they left Damaturu, they were also sighted along Miringa axis of Biu firing gun at communities. At last, to the credit of our gallant troops, they were pushed back.</p> <p>The major concern is that, ISWAP is growing in power and influence especially in its territorial base on the banks and Island of Lake Chad areas. The group has cultivated a level of support among local civilians. International Security Sector Advisory Team (ISSAT) reported that there is strong bond between ISWAP and these neglected communities and the terrorist group does provide economic support to them and treating them better than parent organization (Boko Haram) and by filling gaps in governance and service delivery. Filling this gap in governance and service delivery is very essential in winning this war and of course getting information from the communities that will help in tackling the conflict.</p> <p>ISWAP approach appears to have paid dividends in term of recruitment and support from the communities, displacing them will not be easy because they close to the population especially those communities of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The group reportedly extends micro-loans to local communities especially to women, youths and farmers. The government should not use force alone in fighting them; non-kinetic approach should also be considered to weaken their ties with those communities.</p> <p>For Nigeria to win this war, one step to start is to address the issue of human right abuses committed by security personnel and conduct themselves more professionally in discharging their duties in the affected communities. This will win the heart of rural communities to provide the necessary information needed to counter ISWAP terrorists in the region.</p> <p>Idris Mohammed, Abuja</p> <p>Share this: Facebook</p> <p>Reddit</p> <p>Twitter</p> <p>Print</p> <p>Pinterest</p> <p>Email</p> <p>WhatsApp</p> <p>Skype</p> <p>LinkedIn</p> <p>Tumblr</p> <p>Pocket</p> <p>Telegram</p>",3

934444390,Civil Rights Activist Recounts Being the Victim of an ‘Attempted Lynching’ in Viral Video,2020-07-10 00:00:00,"<p>An Indiana civil rights activist alleges he was the victim of an attempted lynching in a July 4, 2020, incident, which was captured in portions on a viral video. On July 17, two of his alleged assailants were arrested and charged with battery and other crimes associated with the incident.</p> <p>In a widely seen July 5, 2020, Facebook post that included three videos, Vauhxx Booker wrote that he and several friends were traveling to a public recreation area at Lake Monroe to view the lunar eclipse and celebrate the Fourth of July holiday when the incident happened.</p> <p>Snopes readers have emailed questions seeking verification as to whether the incident is real, and we learned it is, and has prompted the launch of at least two local and federal investigations.</p> <p>One video shows Booker on his knees, surrounded and pinned against a tree by several white people while bystanders shout for his assailants to release him. One of the men approaches a bystander filming the incident and attempts to knock the camera out of his hand.</p> <p>Booker, who is Black, said the commotion attracted more bystanders who attempted to intervene. In his Facebook post, he recalled, “The attackers told the growing group, ‘we’re going to break his arms’ (while literally attempting to bend my arms behind me) and then stated to the members of their party several times to, ‘get a noose,’ among some other choice slurs.”</p> <p>In another video, which appears to have been shot by Booker as his group was leaving, one of the attackers called him a “nappy-headed b-tch” and taunted him for having “five white friends.”</p> <p>Our attempts to reach Booker for a phone interview were unsuccessful, though he has made numerous public statements about the incident. “You could feel the anger and the intent to try to hurt me,” he said in an interview with The Guardian. In a press conference, Booker stated his belief that had it not been for the intervention of his friends and other bystanders, “I would be a hashtag.”</p> <p>Sean Purdy and Jerry Edward Cox were both charged with felonies associated with the incident. An attorney representing Purdy said that Purdy was defending himself.</p> <p>In a July 13, 2020, press conference, defense attorney David Hennessy, who represents Purdy and Caroline McCord, a third person involved in the incident, said Booker was the aggressor in the incident and that he and his group had initially trespassed on private property. Hennessy said Booker was “restrained — not beaten, restrained,” and also blamed Booker for “race baiting” in order to illicit the racist language heard in the video.</p> <p>Booker and his attorney denied these allegations and stated that Booker was the victim in the incident. On July 17, 2020, Booker announced he had been diagnosed with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. His attorney said his alleged attackers had spat and yelled in his face during the attack.</p> <p>Public pressure for law enforcement to act on Booker’s behalf had mounted as the story has gained national attention. Famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump took to social media to criticize police for letting “these white supremacists walk free.” On July 6, protesters in Booker’s hometown of Bloomington took to the streets seeking arrests in the case when a driver accelerated through the crowd, with two protesters clinging to the vehicle.</p> <p>Booker, who sits on the Monroe County Human Rights Commission, had slammed the fact that no one was initially arrested in the case, noting that Bloomington has been the location of three other incidents in public involving “overtly racist individuals.”</p> <p>“Are we going to wait for a Black person to be lying dead in the gutter before we act?” he asked in his July 4, 2020, Facebook post. “When is enough actually enough?”</p> <p>Videos taken during the incident — which we caution are disturbing — along with commentary from Booker, can be viewed here:</p>",3
995102758,Authoritarianism advances as world battles the pandemic,2021-07-15 07:45:18,"<p>Here’s some of what happened while the world was distracted by the coronavirus: Hungary banned the public depiction of homosexuality. China shut Hong Kong’s last pro-democracy newspaper. Brazil’s government extolled dictatorship. And Belarus hijacked a passenger plane to arrest a journalist.</p> <p>COVID-19 has absorbed the world’s energies and isolated countries from one another, which may have accelerated the creep of authoritarianism and extremism across the globe, some researchers and activists believe.</p> <p>“COVID is a dictator’s dream opportunity,” said Theary Seng, a Cambodian-American human rights lawyer who has been indicted on charges including treason in the ostensibly democratic southeast Asian nation, where Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power for more than three decades.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch accuses Cambodia’s government of using the pandemic as cover to imprison political opponents without due process. Scores have been indicted and face mass trials.</p> <p>When it comes to government opposition, “the fear of COVID, on its own and as a political weapon, has substantially restricted mobility for a gathering or movement to take shape,” Seng said.</p> <p>The biggest global public health emergency in a century has handed power to government authorities and restricted life for billions of people.</p> <p>Luke Cooper, a London School of Economics researcher and author of the book “Authoritarian Contagion,” said the vast economic, health and social resources poured into fighting the pandemic mean “the state is back as a force to manage society and to deliver public goods.”</p> <p>Restrictions on civil liberties or political opponents have been stepped up during the pandemic on several continents.</p> <p>For a decade in Hungary, conservative nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has curtailed media and judicial freedom, criticized multiculturalism and attacked Muslim migrants as a threat to Europe’s Christian identity.</p> <p>During the pandemic, Orban’s government brought in an emergency powers bill allowing it to implement resolutions without parliamentary approval -- effectively a license to rule by decree. In June, it passed a law prohibiting the sharing of content portraying homosexuality or sex reassignment with anyone under 18. The government claims the purpose is to protect children from pedophiles, but it effectively outlawed discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools and the media.</p> <p>Poland’s conservative government has chipped away at the rights of women and gay people. A ruling last year by a government-controlled court that imposed a near-total ban on abortion triggered a wave of protests that defied a ban on mass gatherings during the virus outbreak.</p> <p>In India, the world’s biggest democracy, populist Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of trying to silence voices critical of his administration’s response to a brutal pandemic wave that tore through the country in April and May. His government has arrested journalists and ordered Twitter to remove posts that criticized its handling of the outbreak after introducing sweeping regulations that give it more power to police online content.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was accused by opponents of squashing dissent and introducing policies aimed at refashioning a multifaith democracy into a Hindu nation that discriminates against Muslims and other minorities.</p> <p>In Russia, the government of President Vladimir Putin has used the pandemic as its latest excuse to arrest opposition figures. Associates of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny have been subjected to house arrest and charges that the mass protests against his arrest violated regulations on mass gatherings.</p> <p>In neighboring Belarus, authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko extended his quarter-century iron grip on power by winning an August 2020 election that the opposition -- and many Western countries -- said was rigged. The huge protests that erupted were met with tear gas, rubber bullets and mass arrests.</p> <p>Then, in May, a Ryanair plane flying from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in the Belarusian capital of Minsk after the crew was told of an alleged threat. Opposition journalist Raman Pratasevic, a passenger, was taken off the plane along with his girlfriend and arrested.</p> <p>Western nations called the forced diversion a brazen hijacking and slapped sanctions on Belarus, but those seem unlikely to induce Lukashenko to change his ways and underscore the weakness of democracies in confronting hardline regimes. Hungary’s acts have drawn sharp words from fellow European Union leaders, but the 27-nation bloc has no unified response to restrictive regimes like those in Hungary or Poland.</p> <p>Even before COVID-19 came along, extremism was on the march.</p> <p>“Over the last 15 years, authoritarian politics has replicated all over the world,” Cooper said.</p> <p>“Democracy feels very fragile. Democracy doesn’t have a clear vision for what it’s trying to do in the 21st century.”</p> <p>The 2008 global financial crisis, which saw governments pump billions into teetering banks, shook confidence in the Western world order. And the years of recession and government austerity that followed boosted populism in Europe and North America.</p> <p>In China, authorities saw the 2008 economic crash as evidence that they, and not the world’s democracies, were on the right path.</p> <p>Historian Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Center, said the crisis persuaded China’s communist government that “the West no longer had lessons to teach them.” Since then, Beijing has increasingly flexed China’s economic muscle abroad while cracking down on opposition inside its borders.</p> <p>In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uyghurs have been confined in re-education camps in China’s western Xinjiang region, where activists and former detainees accuse authorities of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control and torture. Beijing instead characterizes the camps as vocational training centers.</p> <p>Beijing also has tightened control on Hong Kong, stifling dissent in the former British colony. Protesters, publishers and journalists critical of Beijing have been jailed and the last remaining pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, stopped publishing in June after the arrest of its top editors and executives.</p> <p>When the coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, authorities responded firmly -- though far from transparently -- with draconian lockdowns that got the virus in check.</p> <p>Mitter said the pandemic has cemented a view -- among many ordinary Chinese, as well as the country’s leaders -- “that something had gone very wrong in terms of the way in which the democratic world had dealt with the virus, and something had gone right in China.”</p> <p>“That is now being used very much as a lesson, not just about the pandemic, but about the virtues of China’s system as opposed to the systems of liberal countries,” he said.</p> <p>Last year, curfews and travel restrictions also became commonplace across Europe. People in France needed to show a signed declaration to travel more than 1 kilometer (just over a half-mile) from home. And Britons were banned by law from going on vacation abroad, while some attendees at a London vigil for a murdered woman were arrested for gathering illegally.</p> <p>British lawmakers have expressed concern about the scope of the Conservative government’s emergency powers, many passed without debate in Parliament.</p> <p>“Since March 2020, the government has introduced a large volume of new legislation, much of it transforming everyday life and introducing unprecedented restrictions on ordinary activities,” said Ann Taylor, an opposition Labour Party politician who chairs the House of Lords Constitution Committee. “Yet parliamentary oversight of these significant policy decisions has been extremely limited.”</p> <p>Politicians and intelligence agencies in the West also have warned of the threat from coronavirus conspiracy theories that dovetail with existing extremist narratives. Many countries have seen large anti-lockdown, anti-mask, anti-vaccine protests attended by a mix of the far right, the far left and assorted conspiracists.</p> <p>The British government has warned of “extremists exploiting the crisis to sow division and undermine the social fabric of our country,” with different hate groups variously blaming Muslims, Jews and 5G phone technology for the pandemic.</p> <p>But there are signs of fighting back. The pandemic also has boosted trust in scientists and spurred demands for more accountable political leadership.</p> <p>In Hungary, which has one of the world’s highest per-capita coronavirus death rates, there is growing opposition both to the government’s pandemic policies and to its wider authoritarian thrust, and thousands have taken to the streets in support of academic freedom and LGBT rights. With an election due in 2022, a six-party opposition coalition has united to try to unseat Orban’s Fidesz party.</p> <p>Both extremism and resistance can be seen in Brazil where the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has expressed nostalgia for the country’s two-decade military dictatorship and last year attended protests against the country’s courts and Congress. He dismissed the virus as a “little flu,” cast doubt on the effectiveness of vaccines and opposed social and economic restrictions.</p> <p>Renato Meirelles, director of Brazilian polling company Locomotive Institute, said authoritarianism had advanced through “a strategy of fake news and attacks on factual truth.” “The next step will be questioning the electronic vote and, as such, the result of the next election,” he said.</p> <p>Bolsonaro has so far been held in check by Brazil’s institutions, especially the Supreme Court, which stopped him from preventing states and cities from implementing restrictions to curb COVID-19 and has ordered an inquiry into the government’s pandemic response. And protests have finally spilled out onto the streets. Twice over the past month, demonstrators marched in dozens of cities across the country.</p> <p>“I’m here to fight for the rights of those in need, for the rights of my children, for my right to live, to have vaccines for all,” said Claudia Maria, a protester in Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>In the United States, President Joe Biden has veered away from the populism of Donald Trump, but a Republican Party radicalized by the former president’s supporters has every chance of winning power again.</p> <p>Cooper, of the LSE, said the authoritarian tide was unlikely to recede soon.</p> <p>“This is a struggle between democracy and authoritarianism that’s going to last decades,” he said.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Associated Press Writers Jim Heintz in Moscow, Justin Spike in Budapest, David Biller in Rio de Janeiro, Christopher Bodeen in Beijing, Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi and Grant Peck in Bangkok contributed.</p>",3
986832255,Belarus closing Canadian embassy as PM Trudeau condemns regime,2021-05-25 12:13:00-04:00,"<p>OTTAWA -- The Government of the Republic of Belarus has announced it will be closing its embassy in Canada, just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned Belarusian authorities and said Canadian officials are contemplating further actions over the forced diversion of a passenger jet to arrest a dissident journalist.</p> <p>The embassy will be suspending its activity on Sept. 1, 2021, though consular services such as processing visa applications and other documents will be halted as of July 10, authorities announced Tuesday.</p> <p>During a press conference on Tuesday, Trudeau called Belarus’ actions “outrageous, illegal, and completely unacceptable.” He said the Canadian government is calling for Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich to be released immediately.</p> <p>“This was a clear attack on democracy and the freedom of the press,” Trudeau said of this weekend’s events.</p> <p>A Ryanair flight that Protasevich was on was forced to divert due to a report of a bomb threat against it as it crossed through Belarus airspace while flying from Greece to Lithuania. A Belarusian fighter jet then escorted the plane and, after landing, the 26-year-old activist, journalist, and critic of President Alexander Lukashenko was arrested.</p> <p>Trudeau condemned the “dangerous interference in civil aviation,” and said that, while Canada has existing sanctions against Belarus, the government is now “examining further options,” he said.</p> <p>In 2020, Canada announced sanctions against dozens of Belarusian officials following presidential elections that Canadian authorities have described as being “marred by widespread irregularities,” and followed “a systematic campaign of repression” and “human rights violations.”</p> <p>On Monday, the European Union agreed to impose sanctions on Belarus, including banning its airlines from using the country's airspace and airports, amid fury over the situation.</p> <p>The prime minister said he supports actions from international institutions including NATO and added that Canada stands “in solidarity with our partners in defending journalists all around the globe.”</p> <p>“It is assumed that the consular functions of the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in Canada would further be performed by the Consulate General of the Republic of Belarus in New York, United States of America,” reads the notice on the embassy’s website.</p> <p>With files from The Associated Press.</p>",3
1030851480,UN Report Increases Pressure on Government Amid Continuing Human Rights Violations,2022-02-28 00:00:00,"<p>Photo courtesy of Kumanan Kanapathippillai</p> <p>There has been some progress on aspects of human rights in Sri Lanka in the past year according to a key United Nations report but major failings remain and, on some matters, the situation has grown worse. Sanctions against alleged perpetrators where there is strong evidence of serious abuses are among the measures recommended to strengthen accountability.</p> <p>There has been a flurry of activity by the regime and its critics in the run up to the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). This is due to run from February 28 to April 1 2022, including a discussion on March 3 on Sri Lanka. In March 2021, a resolution highly critical of the regime’s treatment of ordinary Sri Lankans was passed the UNHRC. The Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, was asked to monitor the situation and report back.</p> <p>While the government has made much of its proposed reforms to the harsh Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the recent update on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka suggests that these are inadequate. Meanwhile, in the light of the Rajapaksa government’s failure to bring perpetrators of serious crimes to book, others abroad are beginning to step in, a trend which will intensify. On February 24, the day before the advance unedited version of the report was published, British war crimes police arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of a Tamil journalist, Mylvaganam Nimalrajan who was murdered in his home in Jaffna in October 2000.</p> <p>The crisis caused by the Russian state’s invasion of Ukraine will overshadow the UNHRC’s gathering. It has also added to Sri Lanka’s economic instability, caused in part by mismanagement, and further undermined confidence in the political leadership, on top of the impact of other scandals. As Foreign Minister G.L. Peiris and his colleagues seek to win support from overseas governments and international institutions, the pressure to make more substantial changes will increase.</p> <p>A grave situation</p> <p>Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka mentions the impact of the economic crisis, including food poverty, and overall paints a sobering picture a year after the previous report, indicating that the hoped-for progress has not materialised. Issues include erosion of the independence of public bodies such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and Right to Information Commission. Civilian government functions are increasingly being militarised; in some cases, current or former military officers – including some accused of serious human rights violations – have been placed in senior positions in ministries.</p> <p>While some of the land that the army took in the North and East during the civil war has been returned, further disputes have arisen. Some are a linked to a Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management in the Eastern Province headed by the Defence Secretary, supposedly seeking to preserve Buddhist sites but in practice resulting in takeover of local people’s land. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa spoke at the UN General Assembly of the Government’s “firm intention to build a prosperous, stable and secure future for all Sri Lankans, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender.” Yet in reality, Ms. Bachelet suggests, “actions by the Government during the past year have reinforced the nexus between Sinhalese nationalism, Buddhism and the state, increasing the sense of marginalisation and anxiety among Tamil, Muslim and Christian minority communities, and undermining the prospects for reconciliation.”</p> <p>A Task Force on legal change headed by the leader of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), which is a “Buddhist” extremist organisation notorious for hate speech and worse, a statue of the Buddha put up (despite a court order) on what is believed to be the site of an ancient Hindu temple, measures targeting Muslims and failure to protect churches from attack are examples.</p> <p>The report describes how civil society organisations, victim groups and human rights advocates are being targeted. The High Commissioner welcomed moves to reduce prison overcrowding during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the release of pre-trial detainees on bail. But suspicious deaths in custody have continued, along with torture and other mistreatment of those imprisoned or detained. A PTA Amendment Bill was brought before Parliament in February 2022, with some positive aspects but still falling far short of meeting international human rights obligations; arbitrary detention and torture are still far too easy.</p> <p>While some longstanding detainees have been released, other people were still being locked up under the PTA and Ms. Bachelet again called for a stop to its use until replaced by a more just law. In March 2021 new de-radicalisation regulations had been added so that people could be detained for up to two years without a case going before a court.</p> <p>Inadequate progress in reconciliation and accountability</p> <p>With regard to allegations of past abuses, “The High Commissioner is gravely concerned about the continuing precarious situation of the families of the disappeared – the majority of whom are represented by women. In addition to their suffering and anguish in not knowing the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones, they continue to struggle with the desperate economic and social consequences this has had on their lives,” made worse by harassment and surveillance.</p> <p>Some payments have been made to those whose lives have been damaged by past violence but detailed information is lacking and there have been workshops aimed at reconciliation yet, the report suggests, justice is crucial.</p> <p>The dropping of charges against a former Navy commander for his involvement in the abduction and disappearance of 11 boys and men in 2008 and 2009, who was then appointed as the Governor of the North Western Province, again signals an unwillingness to address grave abuses. Failure to investigate more fully the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, including the role of security forces, is another concern.</p> <p>The report explains that the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights has been recruiting specialist staff and compiling information on alleged abuses by both the state and other groups (the UN has consistently condemned the Tigers too for violating human rights).</p> <p>Facing the challenge</p> <p>One paragraph that has been the focus of wide attention raises the issue of what can be done by the international community to acknowledge and respond to the suffering of those harmed by the regime’s failures. It states, “The High Commissioner’s previous report recommended that, among a range of measures, Member States explore possible targeted sanctions against credibly alleged perpetrators of grave human rights violations and abuses. On 10 December 2021, the United States Government announced that two Sri Lankan military officers implicated in grave violations would be designated under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation Act, 2021 and ineligible for entry to that country.” Not surprisingly, talk of sanctions has been met with strong reactions.</p> <p>The report points out that this is a major piece of work and the extent of what can be achieved will largely depend on the support of members states and level of funding.</p> <p>The conclusions underline the fact that human rights abuses and threats to democracy are not only historical: “In the last two years, the independence of the judiciary, the Human Rights Commission and other key institutions have been eroded, and democratic space, including for human rights advocacy constricted. There has been a further drift towards militarisation and an emphasis of Sinhala nationalism and Buddhism in State institutions has become more visible, increasing the marginalisation and uncertainty of minority communities, and undermining reconciliation. The forthcoming Constitution drafting process will be of critical importance for the independence of key institutions and issues of devolution and human rights should be monitored closely.”</p> <p>Ms. Bachelet recognises signs of renewed openness of the government in engaging with her office and initial steps towards reform, including changes to the PTA but urges the government to go further and deeper. Although the government emphasises reparation and development, a broader approach is vital, according to the report.</p> <p>There are a range of recommendations for the Sri Lankan authorities to strengthen human rights, as well as some aimed at the international community. These include working with victims to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed by all parties, continuing to explore possible targeted sanctions against those facing credible allegations of grave violations and protecting asylum seekers at risk if sent back.</p> <p>The government disputes the accuracy of the report; however the claims made tie in with other findings from organisations gathering and analysing evidence on human rights in Sri Lanka. Foreign Minister G.L. Peiris is due to lead Sri Lanka’s delegation to UNHRC and speak during the interactive dialogue on March 3.</p> <p>As yet more information comes to light about the scale and gravity of the wrongs done to ordinary Sri Lankans by people misusing power, it will become increasingly hard to ignore the calls for truth and justice as a foundation for healing and rebuilding.</p>",3

Anderson told the paper.</p> <p>A spokesman for Twitter told the Post that the personal data that was compromised is restricted “to a limited group of trained and vetted employees.”</p> <p>A source confirmed to the paper that the Saudi official that the three men were reporting to was Bader Al Asaker, whose charity – MiSK – is owned by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto leader.</p> <p>In 2015, when most of the alleged activity took place, Mohammed was rapidly rising through the ranks of Saudi politics.</p> <p>When Salman, Mohammed’s father, became king in early 2015, he quickly named Mohammed defense minister and then deputy crown prince shortly thereafter.</p> <p>It was during this time that Alzabarah was particularly active in viewing Abdulaziz’s data and contacting Asaker, according to Justice Department officials.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch researcher Adam Coogle told the Post that this case is “incredibly significant.”</p> <p>“Twitter is the de facto public space of Saudi Arabia — the place where Saudi citizens come and discuss issues,” Coogle explained.</p> <p>“It’s a space in which the Saudi authorities have used various means to curtail critical voices, including by seeking to unmask anonymous accounts.”</p> <p>Additionally, Brookings Institution senior fellow Tamara Cofman Wittes told the paper that the case highlights “how early” pursuit of Mohammed dissenters started as well as Saudi officials’ “willingness to pursue these people even when it involves the subversion of major American corporations and the targeting of people in friendly countries.”</p> <p>Mohammed has been linked to Khashoggi’s murder, which happened in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.</p>",3

He was incarcerated for 37 years for conviction of attempted murder of police officer in New York City.</p> <p>by Workers World</p> <p>The following are excerpts from testimony given at the Oct. 23-25 Spirit of Mandela International Tribunal for Political Prisoners, held in New York City. The U.S. was found guilty of six counts of human rights violations, including mass incarceration – in particular, of political prisoners and prisoners of war. These excerpts include opening remarks and answers to questions asked by Tribunal examiners.</p> <p>Jose Saldaña, director, Release Aging People in Prison: Incarcerated for 37 years for conviction of attempted murder of police officer in New York City; Saldaña claimed self-defense</p> <p>I actually see the face of mass incarceration, and that face is grandfathers, fathers, sons, brothers. We can also apply it to grandmothers and mothers and daughters, all scattered across the New York state prison system. Just imagine the devastation that this would do to the family structure and then to the community.</p> <p>So the face of mass incarceration is to eliminate vital parts of families from communities. And this was devastating seeing that this is what was happening and equating it to what happened during the chattel slave history, and then understanding that my children also went through this.</p> <p>I saw this as new genocide</p> <p>I watched 16-, 17-year-old kids languish in prison for 30, 35 years. We’re talking about Brown and Black kids coming in at that age. By the dozens, some dying, never returning back to their families. I saw this as new genocide because if it was happening to white kids at the level that it was happening to Black and Brown kids, there would be a public uproar. To me, this is neo-genocide.</p> <p>It’s not as brutal as the genocide we’re accustomed to seeing in history. But this is so subtle that if you’re not actually in the face of the storm, you might miss it, and you might not make the connections.</p> <p>It’s definitely a new form of genocide, but it’s just as devastating and it’s just how now people are being targeted. The highest office labeled our children “predators” and then funded the state to kill, to create more prisons for them. That’s a conspiracy.</p> <p>Sharonne Salaam, Justice 4 the Wrongfully Incarcerated: Mother of Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five</p> <p>When my son, Yusef Salaam, returned from prison, he had spent just about seven years in prison.

It was an old technique. He said: “Listen, this crime happened. It doesn’t matter who committed the crime, but somebody has got to pay.” And these kids lived around that park. They were rounded up with many other kids, and they were put in jail for a crime they didn’t commit.</p> <p>Who pays for the damage that’s being done to our loved ones? The only reason it’s happening is because they feel we are worthless people in this society. We have no power to change it. And for those of us who have a voice, who have some power, who have some strength, we have to move forward and shout from the rooftops about the innocent people in jail – and there are quite a few of them.</p> <p>Sekou Odinga, member, Black Liberation Army: Incarcerated for 33 years</p> <p>I was a combatant in the Black Liberation Army and captured in 1981 while trying to help transport another soldier of the BLA. He was captured also but murdered in the street while he lay there in submission, trying to give up. They shot him in the back of the head. I consider myself a political prisoner. And based on how I was treated, the state considered me a political prisoner also.</p> <p>After my capture, I was beaten and tortured for the next six to seven hours. Usually in the U.S. when the police capture somebody or arrest someone, they don’t torture them for no six or seven hours. They might smack them upside the head or beat them up for 10-15 minutes.</p> <p>Sekou Odinga is a member of the Black Liberation Army. He was beaten, tortured and unjustly incarcerated for 33 years.</p> <p>That’s par for the course, you know. But for political prisoners, they usually save a particular brutal torture. My head was split open with a handheld walkie talkie that one of the cops, after he cuffed me with my hands behind my back, decided to hit me in the head and knocked me down, almost knocking me out.</p> <p>At the precinct, they kept me cuffed with my hands behind my back, stood two police on each side of me and started interrogating me. And every time I would answer a question that they didn’t like, they would beat me or burn me with a cigar, or they would take my shoes off and grind my toe until the toenail came off.</p> <p>And this went on for about six to seven hours, all the time asking me questions about other comrades that they were looking for, Assata Shakur being one of them. Abdullah Majid being another one.</p> <p>Oscar López Rivera, member, Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation: Incarcerated for 36 years</p> <p>Solitary confinement is a very detrimental instrument, and it does create a lot of problems for those of us who are the victims of it. A penitentiary like ADX or Marion is very dehumanizing.</p> <p>What the United States government wanted most was to make us pay for a movement that was creating a lot of problems for them. We were condemned to as many years as they could sentence us to. But all of us made a commitment to the independence of Puerto Rico.</p> <p>We were willing to go to prison for Puerto Rico and for the decolonization of Puerto Rico. And for the decolonization of other places, because we never focused only on Puerto Rico.</p> <p>Oscar López Rivera is part of the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation. For his work fighting for Puerto Rican decolonization, he was caged for 36 years.</p> <p>For us, the injustices that the United States government was doing were painful. When the United States government thought that they really had us, we were strong and we were able to face the challenges that they imposed on us. Puerto Rico’s independence is absolutely necessary.</p> <p>Colonialism is that tool the United States government has used effectively to take our most fundamental rights as human beings, and that’s the right to self-determination. I am profoundly grateful for what Puerto Ricans did for us.</p> <p>After 36 years of imprisonment, I came home feeling stronger than the day that I entered the first penitentiary, and the time I spent in those penitentiaries was always awful. But little by little, I was able to transcend all the punishments that they threw at me.</p> <p>And I walked out of the United States and into Puerto Rico. And for the independence of Puerto Rico, I have not given up.</p> <p>Saleem Holbrook, executive director, Abolitionist Law Center</p> <p>It’s clear cut when you have a system that was founded on exploitation, that was founded on genocide, and its legacy continues today, there’s no alternative but abolition. We have tried for centuries to reform this system.</p> <p>In 2020, we all witnessed national uprisings against police violence, against police murder, against extrajudicial murder in this country. However, that uprising was nothing new. We saw it in the 1960s. We saw it in 1980 in Liberty City. We saw it in 1992 in Los Angeles. We could go back to the riots of 1919, and we could go back further. This is an epidemic in this country that we have been dealing with for generations.</p> <p>Saleem Holbrook is executive director of the Abolitionist Law Center, a law firm founded to abolish racist and classist mass incarceration in the US.</p> <p>It’s unfortunate that I still had to experience this when political prisoners and movements 30, 40 and 50 years ago were fighting against this system and the abuses that it brings upon us.</p> <p>The common failure that I see is that when you look at all of the after-action reports, when you look at all the government reports, all of the city reports, all of them trot out the same tired reforms that were trotted out the last time there was an uprising, the last time there was a riot, the last time we felt the need to have to take to the streets and set something on fire.</p> <p>You have to come to the realization that this tactic has failed. And now we have to push further for abolition, because you can’t reform it.</p> <p>Jalil Muntaqim, member, Black Liberation Army and Black Panther Party: Incarcerated for 49 years</p> <p>COINTELPRO was an operation by the federal government, by the FBI, to destroy any progressive, revolutionary or national militant organization during the ’50s, ’60s and the ’70s. COINTELPRO operated to create dissension to infiltrate and to destroy a movement – to use every resource available to them to destroy the Black Panther Party. And by virtue of that, we fought back.</p> <p>It’s very important to understand that our relationship to the state is political. Although they criminalize our politics, they convict us in the court of the criminal courts of law; and therefore, they try to deny the existence of political prisoners. I just want to make this point clear.</p> <p>Jalil Muntaqim, a Black Liberation Army and Black Panther Party member and recently released Political Prisoner, was wrongfully incarcerated for 49 years until 2021. In 1977, he started the first petition to the UN to acknowledge the existence of political prisoners. He conceived of the tribunal, just held in October, while still in prison in 2018.</p> <p>Back in 1977, I initiated the first petition to the United Nations to acknowledge the existence of political prisoners and, in the course of that, the conditions of prison itself. They denied the existence of political prisoners in the United States, the only industrial nation in the world that I’m aware of who denies the existence of political prisoners.</p> <p>Because we are political, the state tries to suppress our capacity to teach. I was sent to solitary confinement for four months for my teaching classes. I was teaching the history of resistance.</p> <p>One of the things that they did not want us to do is teach prisoners, to raise their consciousness, to remove their relationship with a criminal mentality, to move them towards a revolutionary mentality. And so by virtue of that alone, we political prisoners are targeted inside prisons.</p> <p>We are targeted for segregation. We’re targeted to be removed from the populations, we’re targeted in every kind of way that we try to evolve ourselves inside prisons. They try to suppress it.</p> <p>This story was originally published by Workers World, 147 W. 24th St., 2nd Fl., New York NY 10011, 212-627-2994, wwp@workers.org, www.workers.org.</p>",3
953441471,Xu Zhiyong’s Long March To Reform,2014-02-22 04:32:49,"<p>At Dissent Magazine Nicholas Cavell reports on imprisoned lawyer and civil rights activist Xu Zhiyong’s “powerful” closing statement in court in which he emphasized his dedication to the goals of the New Citizens’ Movement, a civil society initiative which he formally established in 2012. Xu was arrested in August for allegedly organizing anti-corruption demonstrations, becoming one of the first of several dissidents to recently stand trial under Xi Jinping’s crackdown on civil society. His translated closing statement is excerpted here:</p> <p>You have accused me of disrupting public order for my efforts to push for rights of equal access to education and for reforms allowing migrant workers’ children to sit for university entrance examinations where they reside, as well as for my calls that officials publicly declare their assets. While on the face of it, this appears to be an issue of the boundary between a citizen’s right to free speech and public order, what this is, in fact, is the issue of whether or not you recognize a citizen’s constitutional rights. On a still deeper level, this is actually an issue of fears you all carry within: fear of a public trial, fear of a citizen’s freedom to observe a trial, fear of my name appearing online, and fear of the free society nearly upon us. […] [While] you have not mentioned the New Citizens’ Movement throughout this trial, many of the documents presented here relate to it, and in my view there is no need to avoid the issue. . . . What the New Citizens’ Movement advocates is for each and every Chinese national to act and behave as a citizen, to accept our roles as citizens and masters of our country—not to act as feudal subjects, remain complacent, and accept mob rule or a position as an underclass. . . . [Source]</p> <p>Also at Dissent Magazine, Jeffrey Wasserstrom chairs a roundtable “on law, reform and repression in China” with Fordham Law School’s Carl Minzner, lawyer Rebecca Liao, the Open Society Foundations’ Thomas Kellogg, and the UC Irvine School of Law’s Benjamin van Rooij. Liao describes Xu’s trial as “disappointing” and indicative of a step back for legal reform in China:</p> <p>Alas, we found out this month that the party’s attempt to understand and implement legal best practices does not apply to all. The trials of Xu Zhiyong and fellow members of the New Citizens’ Movement he founded are a disappointing, befuddling step back for China’s legal reform program. These are the highest-profile legal proceedings since Bo’s trial, and contrasts between the two could not be starker. Xu’s trial was closed to the public and the media. There was no Weibo feed offering a window into the case. The defense was not able to call or cross-examine witnesses. Xu was summarily cut off midway through his statement to the court. At first blush, it would appear that the party has every incentive to replicate the procedural safeguards and transparency of the Bo trial. An international and domestic audience is also watching Xu’s case and passing judgment on China’s legal system, the linchpin of Xi Jinping’s reform agenda. A major difference, however, between Xu’s and Bo’s cases is that the latter was a matter of political infighting. Though the stakes were high, all parties involved were known quantities to one another, compatriots and colleagues working, at the end of the day, to strengthen the Communist Party. A deal could be struck ahead of time. The party had no such luxury with Xu and therefore believed it had to circumvent legal procedure to retain control of the trial’s messaging. [Source]</p> <p>Maya Wang at Human Rights Watch adds that the Chinese government “should think hard about the road they are taking” when choosing to crackdown on the New Citizens’ Movement:</p> <p>The current crackdown is arguably one of the biggest and most concerted in the past twenty years. Ten activists who organize under the banner of Xu’s New Citizens Movement have gone on trial within months—and that is not counting the detentions and imprisonment of many others not even related to the New Citizens effort. At the same time, the government has systematically tightened other contentious spaces for public activism, putting new controls on the Internet, mass media and even universities. Pressure in Tibet and Xinjiang has also intensified, culminating with the arrest of Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti in mid-January for the crime of “splittism.” What makes this latest round of repression distressing is that the message of the rights defense movement and the New Citizens Movement in particular was modest, inclusive and constructive. Xu borrowed the language of the government on the rule of law and justice, and that should have made him less of a threat. The New Citizens Movement never organized opposition parties or explicitly pushed for multi-party democracy, which is the Communist Party’s greatest fear, but Xi Jinping and his new government seem unable to tolerate even moderate critics.

1041812723,Daily Blog urges “treason” investigation into New Zealand Trotskyists,2022-04-29 00:00:00,"<p>On April 16, Martyn Bradbury, editor of New Zealand’s Daily Blog, published an extraordinary attack on the Socialist Equality Group (SEG), the New Zealand supporters of the International Committee of the Fourth International.</p> <p>Martyn Bradbury (Credit: Facebook / Martyn Bradbury, thedailyblog.co.nz, WSWS Media)</p> <p>Bradbury calls on the Security Intelligence Service (SIS), the state’s domestic spy agency, to “openly investigate Socialist Equality Group as Chinese enablers and for possible treason.” The SIS has a long and well-known history of spying on left-wing and anti-war organisations and activists, including during the movement against the Vietnam war and protests against nuclear weapons.</p> <p>In crude McCarthyite language, indistinguishable from that of the extreme right, Bradbury writes: “the craven China worship by quisling website Socialist Equality Group decry [sic] any criticism of the largest human rights abusing regime on the face of the Planet, China, by attacking anyone challenging their authoritarian abuses.”</p> <p>It is necessary to call this out for what it is. Bradbury has emerged as a shill for the security agencies, and is fingering the Trotskyist movement for state repression. His hysterical outburst, under the headline “China lab leak theory refuses to die,” is further confirmation that there is nothing remotely left wing or progressive about the Daily Blog, a middle-class nationalist publication that supports the Labour Party-Greens government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.</p> <p>The attack on the SEG, which was reposted on April 27 with an extended denunciation of China, has the character of a preemptive strike. It is aimed at intimidating anyone who opposes the pro-war hysteria being whipped up by Washington and its allies, including the New Zealand political establishment and media. The Daily Blog’s post undoubtedly reflects discussions that are underway within the political establishment about how to stop the development of a genuine internationalist revolutionary leadership in the working class to oppose the drive to war and the capitalist system that is its source.</p> <p>Bradbury’s reference to China’s human rights abuses echoes the cynical propaganda from the media and US intelligence agencies, which have accused China, without any evidence, of carrying out “genocide” against the Uyghur population. The US ruling class has zero concern for the working class in China, including the Uyghurs, who certainly suffer repression and exploitation at the hands of the capitalist state.</p> <p>The political opposition of the Trotskyist movement to the Maoist Chinese Communist Party regime in Beijing and its oppressive methods from the standpoint of the international working class is longstanding and well-documented. However, the US is actively preparing for war with China and deliberately escalating tensions with Beijing.</p> <p>Over the past three decades, it is US imperialism and its allies, not China, which are responsible for the criminal wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya—to name only a few of the most recent—that have killed millions of people and destroyed entire societies. The invocation of “human rights” has been used to justify every single war against America’s enemies—including the present US-NATO proxy war against Russia in Ukraine.</p> <p>Bradbury’s attack on the SEG comes as the war in Ukraine escalates, and there are growing threats against China, which US imperialism regards as the major obstacle to its domination over the Eurasian landmass. The Ardern government has sent dozens of troops to Europe to join the war effort and faces a growing crisis in New Zealand. As elsewhere around the globe, historic class struggles are on the agenda, fuelled by the soaring cost of living and the disastrous spread of COVID-19.</p> <p>There are precedents for the sort of state repression the Daily Blog is demanding. During the First and Second World Wars, the New Zealand state imprisoned hundreds of anti-war and left-wing activists for “sedition”; leftist and socialist publications were banned. In the United States, 18 members of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party were put on trial and sentenced to prison terms during WWII for opposing the war.</p> <p>Bradbury’s comparison of the SEG to Vidkun Quisling, Norway’s Nazi-collaborationist leader in World War II, is not accidental: during World War II, the Trotskyists were smeared as fascist collaborators, by Stalinists and others, because of their principled opposition to war. By absurdly painting China as the modern-day equivalent to Nazi Germany, the Daily Blog presents any opposition to the US-led war drive as criminal.</p> <p>Bradbury makes clear that what he regards as “treason” is the SEG’s exposure of the anti-Chinese propaganda that he has been publishing for years to justify New Zealand’s integration into the US military build-up in the Indo-Pacific region. The blog post particularly objected to a World Socialist Web Site article by SEG member John Braddock, which outlined the Daily Blog’s role in promoting the right-wing conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in a laboratory in Wuhan.</p> <p>The theory, which has been thoroughly discredited by scientists, was concocted by Trump’s fascist ally Steve Bannon and his associates. The lab leak lie serves definite political purposes: to divert blame for the disastrous US response to the pandemic, which has led to more than a million deaths; and to demonise China in preparation for war. The Daily Blog editor unabashedly lines up behind Trump, declaring that he “might have been right all along” and that “deep suspicion of China is justified.”</p> <p>The Daily Blog paints China as a threat to New Zealand and calls for it to be turned into a “fortress,” with military spending increased from 1.5 to 5 percent of GDP. Bradbury has joined the latest media furor over China’s security agreement with the Solomon Islands. On March 26, he declared: “China is stepping into our sphere of influence through insidious means masquerading as security.” He called for NZ “to decouple its economy from China,” describing this as a “national security issue.”</p> <p>Since 2017, the Daily Blog has promoted the pro-US academic Anne-Marie Brady, a key player in New Zealand and Australia’s anti-China campaign. She has accused Chinese-born MPs of being spies, and demanded state surveillance of Chinese student organisations, cultural groups, media organisations, academics and businesses with ties to China.</p> <p>Now, Bradbury wants this witch hunt to be extended to target the Trotskyist movement, the only political tendency fighting to build a global movement of the working class against war, based on socialist and internationalist principles.</p> <p>Internationally, as the danger of a third world war increases, the ICFI faces increasing censorship and threats of state surveillance. In Germany, the Socialist Equality Party has been labelled as “left wing extremist” by the state security agency, because of its opposition to capitalism and to the revival of militarism. In Australia, where the Morrison government and Labor are promising billions of dollars for the military to prepare for war with China, electoral laws have been changed in order to prevent the SEP and other minor parties from participating in the current election under their party name.</p> <p>Internationally, the US-led war plans are backed by various pseudo-left groups, which are close to the trade union bureaucracy and represent sections of the upper middle class. These include the Democratic Socialists of America, Socialist Alliance in Australia, and the Left Party in Germany, among others.</p> <p>In New Zealand, the Daily Blog speaks for a similar middle-class layer, close to the Labour Party and its allies, including the unions, which fears any working class movement developing against the Ardern government’s militarist policies, as well as its assault on living standards and the criminal decision to end NZ’s COVID-19 elimination strategy.</p> <p>In the final analysis, the privileges of the upper middle classes depend on the suppression of the class struggle at home, and on New Zealand’s alliance with the US and Australia, which safeguards NZ’s neo-colonial “sphere of influence” in the Pacific and its business interests throughout the world.</p> <p>The blog’s contributors include former Unite union leader Mike Treen, liberal commentator Chris Trotter, former Alliance Party member Liz Gordon, former Mana Party member John Minto, and other individuals from the pseudo-left liberal milieu. None of them has objected to Bradbury’s embrace of the SIS and his denunciation of socialists as traitors; this is because they agree with him.</p> <p>We call on workers to reject the nationalist and militarist propaganda spewed out by the Daily Blog, and to defend the SEG and the WSWS against Bradbury’s provocative call for suppression by the state.</p> <p>Workers and young people seeking to oppose war can only do so by turning to the socialist and internationalist program fought for by the SEG, which is aimed at uniting workers throughout the world in opposition to the capitalist system. In New Zealand, this requires a political break from the Labour Party and its supporters, including the Daily Blog.</p>",3

1022423841,Emma Watson is right,2022-01-09 03:30:27,"<p>Emma Watson is right</p> <p>Read on for article</p> <p>“Free Palestine!” says actress Emma Watson. She’s right.</p> <p>The territories where the Palestinian Arabs live are indeed enslaved. They deserve to be freed from the tyrannical rule of their oppressors—Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>The actress, best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the “Harry Potter” films, set off a firestorm in the world of social media this week with her Instagram post showing “Free Palestine!” banners and expressing “solidarity” with them. Hopefully, her declaration will stimulate a serious conversation about the cruel occupation that the international community has been ignoring.</p> <p>The details concerning Hamas and the P.A., which I cite here, are all quoted from the latest reports by two strongly pro-Palestinian groups: Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. These are not “Israeli allegations.” They are what the Palestinian Arabs’ most vocal supporters are saying about the two Arab regimes that rule over 98 percent of the Palestinian Arabs.</p> <p>During the past year, “the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and the Hamas de facto administration in the Gaza Strip continued to crack down on dissent, including by stifling freedoms of expression and assembly, attacking journalists and detaining opponents,” reports Amnesty.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch notes that the P.A. recently jailed journalist Sami al-Sai for the crime of “administering a Facebook page that had posted information about PA corruption.” Twenty protesters in Ramallah who dared to cry out against P.A. corruption were likewise jailed. Hamas recently arrested seven citizens for “participating in a video chat where they answered questions from Israeli civilians about life in Gaza.” And other Gazans were jailed for “weakening the revolutionary spirit.”</p> <p>Hamas also frequently executes citizens after “trials” that are “marred with due process violations,” reports Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>How do the P.A. and Hamas regimes treat those whom it arrests? “Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and Gaza routinely used torture and other ill-treatment with impunity. … Security forces in both areas used unnecessary and/or excessive force during law enforcement activities.”</p> <p>What about women’s rights in Occupied Palestine? Amnesty: “Women and girls faced discrimination in law and practice and were inadequately protected against sexual and other gender-based violence, including so-called honour killings.” Last year alone, “nineteen women died in the West Bank and 18 in Gaza as a result of gender-based violence.”</p> <p>Human Rights Watch points out that the P.A. “has no comprehensive domestic violence law.” Keep in mind that the P.A. has been ruling for 27 years. Nearly three decades in power and still no comprehensive domestic violence law.</p> <p>With regard to gay rights, Amnesty reports: “Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people continued to face discrimination and lacked protection” at the hands of Hamas and the P.A. In Gaza, section 152 of the penal code “criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity and makes it punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment.”</p> <p>Citing local Palestinian Arab human-rights activists, Amnesty says that in the past year, there were numerous “violations of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press,” as well as “158 cases in the West Bank and 118 in Gaza of the arbitrary arrests of opponents and critics.”</p> <p>Amnesty says that last year, the Palestinian Centre for Development and Media Freedoms “recorded 97 incidents of attacks against journalists, including arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment during interrogation, confiscation of equipment, physical assaults and bans on reporting: 36 in the West Bank and 61 in Gaza.”</p> <p>As for elections, the P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas is now in the 17th year of his four year-term and has repeatedly postponed parliamentary elections. In Gaza, too, democracy is a dirty word.</p> <p>I realize that Emma Watson is an actress, not an expert on Middle East affairs. And in posting about “Palestine,” she might have just been going along with what she thinks all the cool young celebrities are doing.</p> <p>But perhaps the international uproar that she has provoked will inspire her to take a closer look at the implications of what she posted on Instagram. Because in raising the issue of freeing the Palestinian Arabs from their real occupiers, she’s actually on to something.</p> <p>Stephen M. Flatow, an attorney in New Jersey, is the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995. He is the author of “A Father’s Story: My Fight for Justice Against Iranian Terrorism.”</p>",3
1006049887,When You Live Next to an Autocracy,2020-12-16 06:00:00,"<p>Bundled against Mongolia’s frigid late-November air, thousands clamored to see and hear the Dalai Lama four years ago, their boots crunching against a dusting of snow at the Gandantegchinlen monastery in Ulaanbaatar. Mongolia’s officials insisted then, in 2016, that the visit was strictly religious, and had nothing to do with politics: The country has connections to Tibetan Buddhism that reach back hundreds of years—the title “Dalai Lama” is actually of Mongolian origin. Of course, that mattered little to China, which views the octogenarian spiritual leader as a separatist.</p> <p>Beijing promptly canceled meetings with its Mongolian counterparts and slapped fees on commodity imports from Mongolia, which was already suffering from an economic downturn. A month later, the Mongolian government said the Dalai Lama was no longer welcome. He has not returned since.</p> <p>Tsakhia Elbegdorj, Mongolia’s president at the time, told me recently that the decision was, as was widely assumed, due to “pressure from the south,” a reference to China, with which Mongolia shares a border. Elbegdorj has an outsize role in modern Mongolian politics: He served two terms as the country’s president, from 2009 to 2017, and prior to that, two terms as prime minister. He was one of the leaders of the 1990 democratic revolution that peacefully ended seven decades of Mongolia’s serving as a Soviet satellite state. Given his country’s location, hemmed in by Russia and China—two countries that “really don’t like our way of life,” as Elbegdorj put it—and its economic dependence on Beijing, he has spent much of his political life interacting with the highest levels of the Chinese government. By his count, he has met Chinese President Xi Jinping some 30 times. In 2015, Xi hailed China-Mongolia relations as the “best ever.”</p> <p>Now a harsh and high-profile critic of Beijing’s recent efforts to stamp out the Mongolian language and its distinctive, vertical script in Inner Mongolia, an ostensibly autonomous region within China that is distinct from Mongolia, Elbegdorj and his country offer an extreme example of the difficulties facing nations that are heavily reliant on Beijing. Those challenges are amplified for places such as Mongolia—democracies that profess even limited support for human rights. China’s economic and military power allow it to demand uncomfortable concessions, and as the country becomes more and more antagonistic, its less powerful neighbors are left with little room for maneuver. How, then, does a smaller nation choose between its values and its interests?</p> <p>“Of course, when you are in office, you have certain responsibilities,” Elbegdorj told me in one of two recent interviews, struggling at times to square his current vocal denunciations of Chinese policies with his more muted tone when he occupied the highest echelons of government. “But when you are out of office, you also have more freedom to express your ideas.” When I asked him whether he still believed, as his foreign minister said four years ago, that the Dalai Lama should be barred from visiting, he was briefly evasive, before relenting, “I’ll say it publicly now: We are always happy to see his holiness in Mongolia.”</p> <p>When Elbegdorj, a journalist turned democracy advocate, became president in 2009, the country was becoming one of superlatives. It was, briefly, the world’s fastest-growing economy, powered largely by mineral wealth, housing the world’s best-performing stock exchange, located in what is often referred to as the coldest capital city in the world. Prospectors, geologists, heavy-equipment operators, and a stream of carpetbaggers of all varieties arrived from Australia, the U.S., and Europe. The boom brought flashes of wealth to Soviet-influenced Ulaanbaatar: Ostentatiously kitted out Hummers idled in traffic, inching past the softly lit glass front of a Louis Vuitton store. The city’s last statue of Vladimir Lenin came down in 2012. (The boom would prove short-lived—by 2017, the country needed a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.)</p> <p>While he upgraded relations with China, Elbegdorj also worked to bring Mongolia to a more prominent position on the international stage, involving it more heavily in the United Nations and other multinational groups. (He had a moment of viral stardom when former President Barack Obama inadvertently obscured his face during a 2011 photo op.) He pushed for the abolition of the death penalty, which, when it occurred in 2015, brought praise from human-rights groups. President-elect Joe Biden in 2011 hailed Mongolia under Elbegdorj as an “emerging leader in the worldwide democratic movement.” The enthusiasm was tempered a year later, though, when Elbegdorj faced U.S. and UN criticism for the jailing of a former president.</p> <p>But praise from the West for democratic progress cannot make up for uncomfortable geography. “Mongolia’s strong economic dependence on China is worrisome,” Oyunsuren Damdinsuren, a senior lecturer at the National University of Mongolia’s School of International Relations and Public Administration, told me. “If China decides not to buy Mongolian products, our economy will be paralyzed.” This power imbalance has helped fuel broad anti-Chinese sentiment among Mongolia’s population, aided by a history of “200 years of Manchu rule, 70 years of anti-China communist propaganda, and 30 years of China-bashing electoral campaigns,” Damdinsuren said.</p> <p>Read: What happens when China leads the world</p> <p>The Dalai Lama’s visit was not Elbegdorj’s first, or only, China-related controversy. Two years earlier, in 2014, his country’s officials stopped two Mongol-rights advocates from Inner Mongolia who had made their way across the border and were reportedly seeking exile. The pair were sent back to China, and what has happened to them since is unclear. Elbegdorj took both domestic and foreign criticism for the move at the time, and, indeed, still does. He now calls the incident an “unfortunate mistake,” but claims that the decision was made without his input. He added that Mongolia’s current government, led by a populist political rival, should take a stronger stand and allow Inner Mongolians to seek refuge. “I’m openly saying to our government, ‘Don’t give those people back to China,’” he told me. “They should be granted refugee status.”</p> <p>Unbounded by elected office, in recent months Elbegdorj has emerged as one of the most consistent and highest-profile critics of Beijing’s attempts to curb Mongolian language and culture both within its own borders and internationally. During our conversations, he repeatedly said that his outspokenness was not caused by a sudden shift in his thinking—though he acknowledged that there is a distinct challenge in the diplomatic balancing act required to run a country so dependent on China.</p> <p>“I didn’t change,” he said when pressed on these seeming contradictions. “My standing—to keep and continue to protect Mongolian identity, language, culture, and script—since I entered public life, it remains the same.” Rather, he told me, “the Chinese actually changed,” and he noted what he called a “very aggressive” assimilation policy being undertaken by the authorities in Inner Mongolia.</p> <p>Young women in Mongolian ceremonial clothing watched over by Chinese police at opening ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. (James Whitlow Delano / Redux)</p> <p>The full scope of these efforts came to light in September, when China started transitioning students in Inner Mongolia to using state-compiled textbooks and changing the language of lessons from Mongolian to Mandarin Chinese. The situation drew speculation that the Mongols of Inner Mongolia would soon be treated like minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, two regions where China has gone to extraordinary lengths to assimilate ethnic Tibetan and Uighur populations with the national Han Chinese majority.</p> <p>Beijing has responded to criticism of its Inner Mongolia policy with predictable furor. Chinese officials have singled out Elbegdorj, deploying a familiar tactic of accusing him of meddling in its internal affairs. He disagrees with the assessment. “This is not a foreign issue,” he told me. “It is an issue related with my language; it is an issue related with my culture; it is an issue related with my tradition. Mongolians who live in Inner Mongolia, Mongolians who live in Mongolia, they are the same people, the same blood, the same traditions, the same history.” (Elbegdorj’s activism has, so far, been confined to Mongolia, a decision over which he has little say: He is facing a corruption probe and has been barred from leaving the country for the past few months, he told me. He denies the charges and said the investigation was politically motivated.)</p> <p>Read: The end of Hong Kong</p> <p>Mongols make up about 17 percent of the population of Inner Mongolia. The group has sometimes been described as a “model minority” within China. Though notable flare-ups have occurred, Mongolian nationalists have not been as openly radical as Uighurs and Tibetans, and Beijing’s repression there is not nearly as severe as in Xinjiang or Tibet, according to Christopher P. Atwood, a professor of East Asian languages and civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. Society and culture within Inner Mongolia “remains ‘legible’ to Han Chinese in a way that Uyghur and Tibetan society and culture, seen through the lenses of Islamophobia and secularist discourses about ‘primitive superstition’, has not been,” Atwood recently wrote.</p> <p>Beijing has also generally taken a soft approach to Mongolia, never muscling in, for example, on a major mining project. Julian Dierkes, an associate public-policy professor at the University of British Columbia who is an expert on Mongolia, has long argued that this dynamic is due in part to nervousness about China’s sizable domestic Mongolian community and the potential for ethnic conflict. There “has always been this implicit concern or threat around having a large minority population that actually has a country outside to which it refers, unlike Uighurs and unlike Tibetans,” he told me. Elbegdorj similarly described the Mongols of Inner Mongolia as a “living wall” protecting Mongolia from China.</p> <p>These factors made it more alarming when, in July, initial reports of the education reforms began to surface. As the start of a new school year drew near, petitions against the move circulated on Chinese social media, and a number of popular bands backed calls for the decision to be reversed. Students and their parents staged large protests. China’s response was swift: According to human-rights groups, the authorities carried out numerous arrests, harassed journalists, censored social media, and sacked academics who spoke out.</p> <p>In a September letter delivered to the Chinese embassy in Ulaanbaatar and addressed to Xi, Elbegdorj opened with a stinging line: “You, perhaps, have heard and are aware of the fundamental provision in the Constitution of your country that states ‘All nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages’ which is now being flagrantly infringed upon with respect to the Mongolian children of Inner Mongolia.” The Chinese ambassador was incensed, dismissing Elbegdorj’s claims as baseless hype, and the letter was promptly returned. Elbegdorj told me a few weeks before we spoke that his brother had received a menacing phone call warning him that Elbegdorj should stop his advocacy and keep quiet. The call, he said, came from a Chinese phone number.</p> <p>China has not confined its efforts to erase Mongolian identity to its own borders. Château des ducs de Bretagne, a medieval castle in Nantes, France, houses a natural-history museum that was until recently preparing to host an exhibition on the 13th-century Mongol emperor Genghis Khan, organized in collaboration with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot, China. As preparations progressed, however, Chinese officials began asking that words such as empire, Mongol, and even the name Genghis Khan be removed from the exhibit, the museum director, Bertrand Guillet, wrote in a statement. They then went further, demanding that the exhibition synopsis be rewritten by Beijing. The text that emerged was “aimed at making Mongolian history and culture completely disappear for the benefit of a new national story,” according to Guillet. He finally postponed the exhibit, ""in the name of the human, scientific and ethical values defended by the institution.” It will open at a later date but with collections from Europe and America, rather than China.</p> <p>Mongolian politicians have been loath to speak out, likely worried by Beijing’s reaction. The power imbalance was again made clear when China’s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, visited Mongolia in September and was met by protesters angry over the actions in Inner Mongolia. Neither Wang nor Mongolia’s current president made any public statement on the situation. But the Chinese ambassador, in an interview with a local newspaper, noted that China’s demand for Mongolia’s biggest export earner, coal, was falling. The implication was clear. “Frankly,” he was reported as saying, “we are working in your interests.”</p>",3

The sentencing of three men in March and April to lengthy prison terms on charges related to their peaceful dissent underscores the authorities' continued repressive campaign, argued the US-based rights group.</p> <p>Amongst those to be sentenced over the past few months was Abdulrahman Al-Sadhan, a former Saudi Red Crescent employee. The aid worker was sentenced to 20 years in prison, followed by a 20-year travel ban, on charges related to his peaceful expression of dissent in the Kingdom. Saudi courts also sentenced human rights activist Mohammed Al-Rabiah to six years in prison on a host of vague and spurious charges related to his activism.</p> <p>""Saudi Arabia's release of several prominent activists does not signal a softening of repression when the country's terrorism court is spitting out 20-year sentences for peaceful criticism,"" said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at HRW. ""The Saudi authorities may have let a few people out to lessen the international pressure, but their attitude towards dissidents remains the same.""</p> <p>The Washington Post reported that Al-Sadhan's sister has said that the authorities have abused him in detention, using electric shocks, beatings, and verbal abuse. She also said that he was forced to sign documents used as evidence in his trial without having the chance to read them.</p> <p>READ: Saudi activist arrested after criticising 'normalisation with Israel'</p> <p>HRW expressed concern over the spurious allegations being used to imprison peaceful activists. Charges included vague accusations that do not resemble actual crimes, such as ""signing [a statement] seeking to shake the social fabric and weaken national and societal cohesion""; ""communicating and meeting with another to harm the security and stability of the nation…""; not informing on ""supporters and sympathisers"" of the Muslim Brotherhood; ""authoring and publishing a book containing suspicious currents""; and violating the country's abusive cybercrime law.</p> <p>Sources told HRW that prison authorities in Saudi Arabia use electric shocks, waterboarding, and beatings to torture prisoners. They are said to have held one prisoner in small spaces without sleep or rest for days at a time, hung him upside down, and often deprived him of meals during his first year of detention.</p> <p>The change of the US administration in January coincided with the release of a number of high-profile Saudi activists, including, Loujain al-Hathloul. The release of the women's rights campaigner was seen as an indication that the Kingdom was about to turn a corner. However, such illusions have been dismissed by HRW.

A report by a group of women fact-finders who visited Kashmir in September alleged that some 13,000 boys, many as young as 14, have been held in prisons for weeks. While there is no official confirmation of these numbers, the government admitted to a Supreme Court-appointed committee that 144 boys, some as young as nine, have been arrested since August 5 for stone-pelting.</p> <p>But the young man in Arihal, in his 20s, says he was just working his paddy field with his wife when soldiers assaulted him on September 28. ""Three soldiers held me down,"" he alleges. They covered his mouth so he couldn't scream and then, ""one of the soldiers punched me until I bled."" The other two ""thrashed my body and legs and hurled abuses at me"", he says. ""Then they asked me to kneel in the sun and hold my head between my knees while the blood dripped from my nose and mouth.""</p> <p>Not long after the assault, the young man fainted. He woke up in a government hospital in Pulwama, where the doctors noted his case down as an ""alleged assault"". The army, he says, wanted to know who had invited a ""maulvi"" to address the congregation on Friday at a mosque in his village. As we journalists left his home that afternoon, a group of soldiers, maybe half a dozen, appeared in the neighbourhood in black combat fatigues.</p> <p>In Pulwama's Chandgam village, consisting of more than 2,000 households, you see only elderly men on the streets, gossiping behind the shutters of shops closed to business or hailing a ride from a passing car. The young men are either indoors, scared to attract attention, or have run away from their homes altogether so as not to be found by soldiers.</p> <p>Despite the many reports of arrests and violence inflicted on young men, the army has steadfastly denied all allegations of torture. Chandan Kohli, the superintendent of police in Pulwama, says he has not received any complaint of torture or even harassment. ""The villagers should come to me,"" he says, ""but there have been zero complaints.""</p> <p>Colonel Rajesh Kalia, the army spokesman in Srinagar, also gives short shrift to any talk of torture. But at the hospital in Pulwama, senior doctors tell harrowing stories of treating young men who have clearly been victims of assault amounting to torture. One doctor said he treated five men who had sustained serious injuries to their ear drums. Another man's buttocks were swollen and blue from the severity of his beating. ""In 2016,"" he says, referring to the months of unrest after security forces killed Burhan Wani, commander of separatist group Hizbul Mujahideen, ""we'd be treating lots of young men wounded by pellet guns. But in the last two months, we have been receiving patients who have been beaten.""</p> <p>(Photo: ANI)</p> <p>Army chief General Bipin Rawat has been quoted in interviews saying he would ""personally order a full-fledged probe"" should any ""victim"" come forward with an allegation of torture. ""But"", he added, ""I can say for sure that no such action has taken place."" The Pulwama police is investigating one allegation of torture by the army. On September 17, 15-year-old Yawar Ahmad Bhat, from Chandgam, drank poison. He died two days later in hospital. His family says he was detained and beaten by soldiers the day before he took the poison.</p> <p>Where are the restrictions? It is only in your mind. There are no restrictions. Only misinformation about restrictions is being spread... Lack of phone connection is not a human rights violation - Union home minister Amit Shah assured participants at a seminar, in Delhi on September 29, that all was well in Kashmir</p> <p>""Last year, he dropped out of school,"" says Bhat's father. ""His cousin and classmate had been injured by a pellet gun. He was working at an auto workshop, but this year both boys were going to take their exams."" Bhat's family says the soldiers stopped him when he was on his way to buy paint for a car on which his shop was working ""discreetly"" because all commercial establishments had been shuttered since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. Bhat was beaten, his identity card seized and he was told to report to a nearby camp the next morning. His fear of what would be done to him at the camp, his father says, is what drove him to suicide. Kohli says the investigation into Bhat's suicide is still in its early stages, but the army has already described the family's claims as ""baseless"".</p> <p>After releasing their report, the all-women fact-finding team called for an inquiry into the allegations of torture. But Bhat's father is despondent. ""I won't allow my son's body to be exhumed for an autopsy, so that there can be a 'probe'. I know justice won't follow.""</p> <p>Speaking of justice, the Supreme Court has decided to allow the government four weeks to file counter-affidavits to the petitions filed about the constitutionality of its decision to abrogate Article 370. Court hearings will begin on November 14, a couple of weeks after Block Development Council elections in Jammu and Kashmir to be held along party lines, though hundreds of mainstream Kashmiri politicians are still under arrest.

REUTERS/Marina Depetris</p> <p>It was the second joint statement criticizing the kingdom read out at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva in six months, following the first censure of Saudi Arabia at the forum in March.</p> <p>The new statement urged Saudi authorities to establish the truth about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in October and ensure the perpetrators were held to account.</p> <p>Fifteen European Union members, including Britain and Germany, were among the signatories, as well as Canada, New Zealand, and Peru, diplomats said. France, Italy and Spain did not sign.</p> <p>There was no immediate response from the Saudi delegation, which is among the U.N. rights council’s 47 member states but was absent when the statement was read out.</p> <p>The kingdom has regularly denied allegations of torture and unfair detention.</p> <p>The joint statement acknowledged Saudi reforms, including the announcement last month that restrictions on the rights of women to travel will be lifted.</p> <p>“However, we remain deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. Civil society actors in Saudi Arabia still face persecution and intimidation,” Australia’s ambassador Sally Mansfield said, reading out the statement.</p> <p>“We are concerned at reports of torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, unfair trials and harassment of individuals engaged in promoting and defending human rights, their families and colleagues,” she said.</p> <p>Lina al-Hathloul later appealed for the release of her sister Loujain, a prominent women’s rights activist who had campaigned for an end to a ban on women driving. Loujain was jailed in May 2018, weeks before the kingdom lifted the ban.</p> <p>“She was eager to engage with the government to improve the rights of fellow women citizens. Yet instead of considering her as a partner they labeled her a traitor, tortured her,” Lina told the Geneva forum.</p> <p>“I am here today despite the high risk of reprisals to Loujain, our family and myself to call on all states and this Council to demand the Saudi government immediately and unconditionally release my sister,” she said.</p> <p>Agnes Callamard, the U.N. expert on extrajudicial executions worldwide, said in a report last June that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other senior officials should be investigated over Khashoggi’s murder given what she called credible evidence against them.</p> <p>In Riyadh, a minister rejected the report at the time as having nothing new and containing “baseless allegations”. The Saudi public prosecutor has indicted 11 suspects for the crime, including five who could face the death penalty.</p>",3

High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a press statement, adding that the Taliban killed four people during recent demonstrations.</p> <p>Taliban fighters shot and killed two men and wounded several others during demonstrations in Kabul Tuesday, and beat and detained several women and up to 15 journalists, the spokesman said. During protests in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces last month, the Taliban killed a man and a boy and wounded eight others after firing their weapons into the crowds.</p> <p>“As Afghan women and men take to the streets during this time of great uncertainty in their country to press peacefully for their human rights to be respected — including women’s right to work, to freedom of movement, to education and political participation — it is crucial that those in power listen to their voices,” the U.N.'s statement continued.</p> <p>The beating of women and journalists in Kabul’s Karte Char neighborhood occurred on the same day the Taliban announced the ban on all slogans, demonstrations and protests that don’t have official approval, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p> <p>“Their government doesn’t count us as citizens of this country even though we are half of the population,” a protesting woman was quoted as saying. “We don’t care if they beat us or even shoot us, we want to defend our rights. We will continue our protests even if we get killed.”</p> <p>Taliban fighters called the protesting women ""agents of America.""</p> <p>Responding to the protests, the new regime’s interior ministry, which is headed by Sirajuddin Haqqani, a member of the Haqqani network that has long been designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, warned that such protests would be treated as illegal and participants would face “severe legal consequences” unless approved by authorities at least three hours in advance, The Epoch Times reported.</p> <p>At a large protest by men and women on Tuesday, members of the Taliban fired shots into the air to disperse the demonstration held outside the Pakistan embassy in Kabul and arrested reporters.</p> <p>“Taliban authorities are obligated under international law to respect and uphold everyone’s right to peaceful protests and to respect the rights of women and girls,” Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a report.</p> <p>“Concerned governments should press the Taliban to protect free expression and peaceful assembly,” she said.</p> <p>The report also said that Taliban security forces on Tuesday detained journalists from Etilaat-e Roz — Taqi Daryabi and Nemat Naqdi — for covering a protest in Kabul. The journalists were taken to a police station in Kabul, placed in separate cells and severely beaten with cables before being released on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Taliban authorities claimed that they would allow the media to function so long as they ‘respected Islamic values,’ but they are increasingly preventing journalists from reporting on demonstrations,” Gossman added.</p> <p>Nemat Naqdi, a video journalist, and Taqi Daryabi, video editor, from the Etilaatroz newspaper undress to show their wounds after Taliban fighters tortured and beat them in custody after being arrested for reporting on a women’s rights protest in Kabul, Afghanistan.</p> <p>???? @yamphotopic.twitter.com/ipQ658KQMN — L.A. Times Photos (@latimesphotos) September 9, 2021</p> <p>The Taliban’s crackdown on protests and journalists is raising concerns among religious minorities, especially Christians, as they fear increased oppression and persecution as the Taliban have promised strict enforcement of Sharia law, the U.S.-based persecution watchdog International Christian Concern said.</p> <p>Almost all Afghan Christians — estimated to be between 8,000 and 12,000 — are converts from Islam and remain largely closeted and hidden from the public eye due to severe persecution.</p> <p>“Their status as converts makes Afghan Christians direct targets for persecution by both extremist groups and society in general,” ICC said. “In Afghanistan, leaving Islam is considered extremely shameful and converts can face dire consequences if their conversion is discovered.”</p> <p>The fears are not unfounded, given the new leadership.</p> <p>“Prior to the Taliban’s takeover of the country, Afghanistan was one of the hardest places in the world to be a Christian,” ICC’s Regional Manager for South Asia, William Stark, said. “With the Taliban now in complete control and likely to return the country to the oppression of the 1990s, it will be nearly impossible to be a Christian in Afghanistan.”</p> <p>Five of the newly-appointed leaders were in detention in Guantánamo and later exchanged for Bowe Bergdahl in 2014, according to Long War Journal.</p> <p>Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, the current “Emir of the Faithful” or top leader of the Taliban, issued religious decrees justifying the Taliban’s operations, including suicide attacks, from 1996 to 2001, the Journal said.</p> <p>Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, the acting head of state, refused to turn over Osama bin Laden after the al Qaeda terror group bombed the U.S. Embassy in August 1998.</p> <p>Akhundzada and Akhund are among more than a dozen new leaders who were sanctioned by the U.N.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The imprisonments and detentions occurred in 34 countries, although the majority took place in just three — China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Those same countries are also among the top jailers of journalists worldwide, according to the 2019 Committee to Protect Journalists prison census.</p> <p>The data published Tuesday as part of PEN America’s inaugural Freedom to Write Index accounts for poets, scholars, songwriters and translators, among other intellectuals the group described as unjustly detained last year around the world. It does not include journalists unless they also belong to one of the categories in question. Some detained individuals were excluded from the report at the request of family members who feared that public attention could worsen their situations.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“Part of the basis for inclusion here is a consensus among organizations like ours that the charges are spurious,” said Summer Lopez, senior director of PEN America’s free expression programs. To be included on the list, the organization concluded individuals were “being targeted because of their expression, or activism due to their writing” and had spent at least 48 hours behind bars in 2019.</p> <p>PEN America, which tracks threats against writers worldwide, said it launched the index and a new Writers at Risk database to illustrate a growing trend of government leaders clamping down on creative thinkers and intellectuals in an “attempt to quash criticism, clamp down on independent voices and gain control of cultural and historical narratives.”</p> <p>Through their work, writers and intellectuals often offer new perspectives and pave the way for “citizens in repressive societies to envision a different future,” the report said.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>They are also often among the first to be “targeted when a country takes a more authoritarian turn,” Lopez said. “We felt this was kind of a missing piece of this advocacy work on behalf of writers, and I think having that number can be very powerful.”</p> <p>Karin Deutsch Karlekar, director of PEN America’s free expression at risk programs, said that the data, compiled in large part through PEN’s expansive international network of writers and advocates, revealed an alarming number of writers and public intellectuals are being intimidated and detained around the world. More than half of all those detained last year faced national security-related charges.</p> <p>All 30 Turkish intellectuals included in the index faced such charges, the PEN researchers found. Among them was Zehra Dogan, a Kurdish artist and journalist charged in 2017 over a painting of the Turkish city of Nusaybin in the country’s southeast, the site of clashes between the Turkish military and the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) in 2016. She was released in February of last year.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Many of those targeted globally belonged to minority ethnic groups, the researchers found.</p> <p>“There’s a particular focus on writers writing in ethnolinguistic minority languages, and they were particularly targeted in these countries where there are broader crackdowns,” Karlekar said, citing the detention of Uighurs in China, along with people writing in Kurdish in Turkey and Iran.</p> <p>Out of the 73 people in China included in the index, 32 were being held in China’s western Xinjiang region, where the Uighur minority faces widespread surveillance and at least a million people have been detained for “reeducation.” PEN America described the number of people detained there as “likely an underestimate.”</p> <p>Women detainees make up just around 16 percent of the total count, but a disproportionate number of women detained were actively working to advance women’s rights, PEN America found. Among those included in the group’s count is Loujain al-Hathloul, a Saudi writer and women’s rights activist currently behind bars.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Hathloul was detained in 2018 as part of a larger crackdown on activists in the kingdom. Her family alleges she has been tortured while in custody. Last summer, her brother tweeted that she was offered freedom in exchange for signing a document and appearing in a video claiming she had not been tortured.</p> <p>“She immediately ripped the document,” her brother wrote.</p> <p>Hathloul previously served time behind bars in Saudi Arabia for attempting to drive into the country from the United Arab Emirates in 2014. At that time, women were banned from driving in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Karlekar said she was particularly concerned to see India, the world’s largest democracy, on the list as one of the top 10 jailers of writers and intellectuals.</p> <p>“It’s really the only more democratic country on that list,” she said.</p> <p>At least five writers or intellectuals were detained last year in India, according to PEN America, but the country also accounted for more than a third of cases in which an intellectual was continually harassed by state or nonstate actors — a factor the organization also monitors. Intellectuals in India have faced increasing pressure since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was elected in 2014, the group found.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Since Modi’s reelection last year, the report said, officials “have attempted to purge all manifestations of ‘anti-national’ thought from the national discourse and academia, and have weaponized government bureaucracy and pro-government media and social media trolls to attack critical writers, intellectuals, journalists and commentators, and activists.”</p> <p>Although around one-third of those included in the global index have been released from behind bars, Karlekar said many “are really in a state of quasi-freedom and not able to resume their life or their work without fear of reprisal.”</p> <p>But the organization remains “distressed at the number of people still in prison and the potential risks of people in various detention facilities,” Lopez said, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread globally. “There is a particular urgency around getting people out of prison.”</p> <p>Read more</p> <p>GiftOutline Gift Article</p>",3

She was in fact the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) candidate.</p> <p>Nadia, West Bengal, India – Kumaresh Adhikari became a political activist much before turning 18 – the age when you can vote in an Indian election.</p> <p>In his teens, he would plaster the walls in his village in India’s eastern West Bengal state with posters of the party he believed in as he mobilised more activists to join the ranks.</p> <p>Five decades later, at 71, his commitment towards galvanising public support for political mobilisation has not changed. However, his political affiliation has.</p> <p>Adhikari, who once worked for the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) is today a campaigner for the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p> <p>Modi’s BJP, which has never won power in West Bengal, has emerged as the main challenger in an eight-phase state legislative assembly election that started last week and will end on April 29. Results will be declared on May 2.</p> <p>Adhikari, who lives in a remote village located near India’s eastern border with Bangladesh, explains why he now sits on the right of India’s ideological spectrum even though he started his journey with the left.</p> <p>“The communists spoke up for the poor. I came from a poor family so I identified with them,” he said, sitting across his furniture shop in Kadipur village in Nadia district, about 120 kilometres (74 miles) northeast of state capital, Kolkata.</p> <p>“So many years have gone by, but I am still poor. The CPM did not create enough jobs. They did little to alleviate poverty. Just look at my village.”</p> <p>The left front – of which CPM is the main party – ruled West Bengal for 34 consecutive years from 1977 to 2011 – one of the longest-elected communist governments to rule in any part of the world.</p> <p>Adhikari’s Kadipur village falls in Krishnaganj constituency, which the CPM represented in the state assembly for all of those 34 years before Trinamool Congress (TMC), led by its firebrand chief Mamata Banerjee, came to power in 2011.</p> <p>‘From left to Lord Ram’</p> <p>West Bengal has a long history of political violence, with the large CPM cadre accused of attacking opponents, often fatally, during their decades of rule.</p> <p>After the TMC came to power in 2011, the brunt of the new governing party’s brute force was borne by the left workers such as Adhikari.</p> <p>“I have been tied to a pole and tortured by TMC goons,” he told Al Jazeera. “The CPM became so weak so quickly after they lost power that they could no longer protect activists like me.”</p> <p>For him, joining BJP was a matter of survival. “BJP is a force in India and they have the resources and might. I had to join them for survival in 2014. There are many like me,” he said.</p> <p>As West Bengal goes through another election, the trend of left workers and voters deserting the party to join the Hindu nationalist BJP continues to be seen across the state – a phenomenon locally described as “Vaam se Ram” (From the left to Hindu god Ram).</p> <p>The reasons behind the trend are multifold: desperation to protect themselves from attacks by TMC workers; fatigue after decades of CPM dominance; little potential for growth in a party seen as redundant; and, most importantly, the Hindu supremacist campaign run by the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in the state.</p> <p>Inspired by the rise of Nazism in Europe, the RSS was formed in 1925 and aims to create an ethnic Hindu state in India by denying other minorities, mainly Muslims, their political rights.</p> <p>After their induction into the BJP, many former CPM workers Al Jazeera talked to in West Bengal said they undertook a training programme conducted by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a far-right RSS affiliate accused of attacking Muslims and Christians across the country, to help them make the ideological shift.</p> <p>The fresh BJP recruits said they were told by the VHP about the importance of “prioritising Hindus” and how Muslims were involved in the smuggling of cows, which many Hindus consider sacred.</p> <p>Somen Ghosh, 33, used to be a prominent activist with the CPM’s student body in Krishnaganj. He says he has spent the past year looking after 250 cows seized by India’s Border Security Force (BSF).</p> <p>“The cows were being smuggled by Muslims and BSF caught it,” he said. “But someone has to look after the cows. As a Hindu, it is my duty.”</p> <p>Political aspiration is also a reason behind left workers joining India’s governing party.</p> <p>Rita Biswas, 40, who worked with the CPM for 10 years between 2001 and 2011, said she joined the right-wing party in 2018 because she wanted to become a respected political activist in her constituency.</p> <p>“I got nowhere working with the CPM,” she said. “They expect you to toil without any personal returns. Why is it wrong to harbour personal ambitions?”</p> <p>A resident of Ghugurgasi, another village in the Krishnaganj constituency, Biswas runs a self-help group for women. She says she also has to protect herself from the “hooliganism of TMC workers”.</p> <p>“My husband is a migrant labourer. He is mostly working out of the village. I need to think about me and my family’s safety.”</p> <p>West Bengal opposition leaders and voters were often attacked or threatened by CPM workers during their long rule.</p> <p>“Mamata Banerjee was one of them,” said Mohammad Reyaz, a Kolkata-based academic and political commentator.</p> <p>“Therefore, when she came to power, she did not allow any opposition to thrive. There are villages in Bengal where CPM offices were never allowed to open after 2011. The BJP provided an alternative to the CPM cadre and voters being pushed to the margins.”</p> <p>Election data supports Reyaz’s claim. Between the state polls in 2016 and the national election in 2019, the CPM’s vote share in West Bengal dwindled from 26.6 percent to 7.5 percent. At the same time, the BJP’s vote share rose from 10.16 percent to 40.7 percent.</p> <p>The Jangalmahal region, once a left-wing bastion with a large tribal population and one of the state’s most underdeveloped areas, has seen an overwhelming shift to the BJP since 2009.</p> <p>Jangalmahal consists of six West Bengal districts – Purulia, West Bardhaman, Bankura, Birbhum, Jhargram and West Medinipur – and shares the state’s western border with neighbouring Odisha and Jharkhand states.</p> <p>BJP, which had little electoral presence in this region, has virtually wiped out CPM now.</p> <p>The left workers think they can enable the vote share of BJP and then get it back once the TMC is out of the way. But it does not work like that. by Ayesha Khatun, left politician</p> <p>Kalicharan Shaw, who works for the BJP’s media cell in West Bengal, said the shift from left to right in West Bengal has little to do with ideology.</p> <p>“Ideology largely works with the urban, elite electorate, which is still voting for the left,” he said. “The situation in rural areas is different. For them, representation matters.”</p> <p>Shaw said the left had West Bengal for 34 years but the party was “dominated by upper castes” among the Hindus.</p> <p>“The state has a significant population of scheduled castes, backward castes and scheduled tribes. They are our biggest vote bank because the left never nurtured or produced a leader from these communities,” he said.</p> <p>Beginning of end</p> <p>The tectonic shift away from the left, however, came in 2007 at Nandigram, a town 130 kilometres (81 miles) south of Kolkata, when the government led by Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wanted to acquire farmland to develop a special economic zone.</p> <p>But the farmers, backed by opposition leaders, protested the acquisition. To break up the agitation, left-wing cadres allegedly attacked the site. Official records showed 14 deaths, but more than 100 people were said to be missing. Allegations of rape were also made.</p> <p>The Nandigram incident marked the beginning of the end for the left in West Bengal. In the last national election held in 2019, it drew a blank. In 2014, it won just two out of 42 seats.</p> <p>However, Mohammad Salim, a senior CPM leader, said the situation in West Bengal has changed in the past two years.</p> <p>“During the coronavirus-induced lockdown, TMC and BJP were nowhere to be seen,” he told Al Jazeera. “We were in the streets, fighting for those struggling with economic hardships.”</p> <p>Salim said the CPM is still raising the issues of students, women and farmers in the current election. “But the media is ignoring it. We have analysed our failures and you will see a rejuvenated CPM in the upcoming elections,” he said.</p> <p>On the ground, though, the reality appears to be different. For a party that dominated the Jangalmahal region for years, its presence today is strikingly underwhelming as flags and posters of other political parties drown out the CPM campaign.</p> <p>At a brick kiln in one of the remote villages of Purulia district, none of the labourers Al Jazeera talked to said they would vote for the CPM.</p> <p>Sadanand Singh, 37, and his wife Dipali, 28, toiling in the twilight in Dabra village, said their families traditionally voted for the CPM, but the next generation has moved away.</p> <p>“The condition of workers like me did not change much,” said Sadanand. “When TMC came around, we gave them a chance. But that party also turned out to be disappointing. Now, we have a new option in BJP. We should try that out too.”</p> <p>The prospects of a rising BJP, which had little say in West Bengal until 2016, has made several West Bengal observers nervous. The party, heading the federal government since 2014, has been accused of throttling freedom of expression, jailing its critics, and persecuting the minorities, mainly Muslims, who constitute more than 14 percent of the country’s population.</p> <p>In Bengal, Muslims form nearly 30 percent of its population, raising concerns over the BJP gaining a strong foothold in the state.</p> <p>But critics say the CPM also failed to stop communal forces from entering West Bengal by ignoring the right-wing party.

938713610,Tawanda Mutasah: How Mnangagwa became an international outlaw – Nehanda Radio,2020-08-03 00:00:00,"<p>By Tawanda Mutasah</p> <p>The 31 July arrest by Mnangagwa’s regime of internationally acclaimed author Tsitsi Dangarembga, lawyer Fadzayi Mahere, and other peaceful, socially-distancing protesters, some of them even standing alone or walking near their homes holding mild-mannered protest placards, rounded off a febrile month of citizen discontent and state confusion.</p> <p>Tawanda Mutasah is an international lawyer and a recipient of the International Bar Association’s International Rule of Law Award.</p> <p>It was a month in which Zimbabwe’s callous regime showed its true colors often and vividly, including in how the case of Hopewell Chin’ono and Mduduzi Mathuthu unmasked the regime’s posturing to the international community about fighting corruption.</p> <p>Today, as Chin’ono, arrested on 20 July, clocks two weeks in pretrial detention after being denied bail, while Obadiah Moyo, the Mnangagwa ally whose graft Chin’ono exposed, sleeps in the comfort of his own bed, Mnangagwa finds himself unable to fend off the international opprobrium that this new low has attracted.</p> <p>Despite investments to burnish the government’s image in international society, Mnangagwa can no longer convince any rational observer that his gross violations of the human rights of his own people are somehow an act of righteous resistance against the West – the favorite bogeyman of his regime.</p> <p>That corruption-busting journalists Chin’ono and Mduduzi Mathuthu – the latter now being sought by Mnangagwa’s security forces who thought nothing of abducting his non-journalist relatives and even brutally torturing his nephew Tawanda Muchehiwa to ransom Mathuthu into surrendering himself – are being punished through the blatant abuse of police powers, bail and pretrial detention, has ultimately confirmed to the world what Mnangagwa’s regime is actually about – in spite of its rhetoric.</p> <p>It will be recalled that, formally during some periods, and informally during others, Mnangagwa had been Mugabe’s trusted special security affairs assistant for all of forty years, from 1977 during the liberation struggle against white minority rule, up to November 2017 when the former took over following the military coup that forcibly retired his mentor and father figure.</p> <p>When Mnangagwa began his “reign” – as he unabashedly calls it at his ZANU PF rallies – an international community exhausted from years of Mugabe’s villainy hankered after the opportunity for rapprochement and partnership. International investors imagined the dawning of a new era of predictable rules, cleaning up of pervasive corruption, and reigning in of rent-seeking officialdom.</p> <p>Mnangagwa himself played along, adopting the mantra, “Zimbabwe is (now) open for business”, and, as he took to the perennial donning of a scarf in the national colors, serving as a moving billboard of the country’s supposed new standing in the community of nations.</p> <p>Yet it has taken a mere two years for Mnangagwa’s awkward pretense to collapse totally, and irretrievably. Matching Mugabe in cruelty and entitlement, but bereft of his erstwhile mentor’s eloquence and intelligence, Mnangagwa has promptly cut himself out as a buffoon, pitiably clueless in statecraft, and possessing a cartoonish sense of his own invincibility.</p> <p>The world has now seen what discerning Zimbabweans always knew: that Mnangagwa was in fact Mugabe’s water carrier and enforcer, and that November 2017 was neither state epiphany nor ruling party self-renewal, but simply the impatience of a son awaiting the inheritance of his own turn to maim, kill and steal.</p> <p>Because, what open-for-business rhetoric can remain standing after the vindictive arrest of Hopewell Chin’ono, who has been leading exposé after exposé of serious corruption in government, some of it implicating Mnangagwa or his family?</p> <p>What “second republic” and “new dispensation” bombast can sound meaningful after the recent abduction of, and shocking sexual violence against, three young female opposition party organizers – who included a member of the National Assembly – and the subsequent traumatization of the same women through their arrest for supposedly faking their own abduction?</p> <p>What claims about reforming politically and fighting corruption can be sustained after a two-year period in which peaceful demonstrators have been gunned down in cold blood, elections have been manipulated, big political fish remain untouched in spite of clear evidence that they are looting the public purse, and crimes under international law such as abductions and systematic torture continue precisely from where Mugabe left off?</p> <p>Now, the regime in Harare will say that Hopewell was not arrested for being a journalist. The actual allegations against him are “incitement to participate in public violence”, this for having tweeted to the effect that Zimbabweans must not tolerate corruption, and that they have constitutional rights of assembly and expression.</p> <p>The regime knows that the substantive allegations against him are legal hot air, and so clearly the idea is to effectively punish Hopewell through pretrial travesties. As senior Mnangagwa ally Patrick Chinamasa had previously expressed his discomfort that Hopewell’s anti-corruption journalism was embarrassing Mnangagwa’s family, the regime’s animus against Hopewell is obvious.</p> <p>Still, to understand why the arrest and arraignment are absurd, how they amount to the use of police powers and prosecution process as persecution of (perceived) opponents, and, as Amnesty International Regional Director Deprose Muchena has observed, how they seek to inspire fear in critics, international observers need two contexts: context on the way Mnangagwa’s regime operates; and context on the alleged crime itself.</p> <p>A few most recent examples illustrate the dynamics.</p> <p>Last month, Zimbabwe’s Chief Justice issued directives to judges, requiring that, before they are issued, their judgments are to be “seen and approved” by their superiors – a patently unconstitutional instruction to judges that are supposed to be independent.</p> <p>Although the Chief Justice tried to walk back the order the following day by dropping the word “approved” to leave the requirement that the judgments be “seen” – whatever that means – and although it was further claimed that he had later withdrawn the entire directive, the whole purpose was and remains clear.</p> <p>In the same troubled month, lawyer and academic Alex Magaisa exposed the extensive looting by senior regime figures and their friends of an agricultural mechanization scheme under Mugabe, a heist that resulted in a massive public debt burden on the back of taxpayers.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of the recent investigative revelations by Hopewell, Mathuthu, and other journalists, of the Covid-19 supplies scandal; concerns by legislators such as Tendai Biti at the Public Accounts Committee about billions of dollars that have been diverted from another agricultural scheme, this time under Mnangagwa, styled “command agriculture”; strikes by nurses amidst a now totally collapsed healthcare system; and a festering of desperation in a hungry populace some of whom said they wanted to see mass demonstrations against the regime, throughout July Mnangagwa operated in panic mode.</p> <p>On 21 July, Mnangagwa announced enhanced Covid-19 lockdown measures for an indefinite period, making no reference to any calibration of levels of government measures as previously done. Under the new measures, in addition to everyone being under curfew from 6 pm to 6 am, during the day all “non-working” Zimbabweans are required to stay home except when looking for essentials, a measure that is immensely complicated by the fact that formal unemployment in the country is at over 90 percent.</p> <p>Even against the background of a genuinely worsening Covid-19 situation, still the draconian nature of Mnangagwa’s measures raised the eyebrows of the United Nations. And the insincerity of these measures became all too clear as one recalled how, since the onset of the pandemic, Mnangagwa himself had continued to convene several non-socially-distanced ruling party events, and, just prior to his 21 July announcement, it had not been unusual to see mask-less, sardine-packed police officers sitting in the beds of huge police trucks, patrolling for lockdown compliance.</p> <p>Lawyers have recently been arrested on charges that have stood clearly to the legal profession in the country and to international human rights organizations as the blatant persecution that they represent.</p> <p>And in the regime’s discombobulated response to Magaisa’s agricultural mechanization exposé, even Rhodesia was invoked as supposed good practice in its having passed onto black and white taxpayers the burden of odious debts generated from racist state spending on its minority white population.</p> <p>It is in this context that on Monday 20 July, about eight police officers broke a glass partition to force their way into Chin’ono’s home, seizing him without due process, and later turning him up at a Harare police station.</p> <p>It is in this context that on the following Tuesday, after Chin’ono had spent a night in police cells, Magistrate Judith Taruvinga signed a vague and overbroad warrant for the police to search Chin’ono’s house for “illegal documents and other articles kept at the house”.</p> <p>It is in this context that about 30 armed riot police later that day raided Chin’ono’s home to seize his camera – as if a tweet would reside in a camera – and this after having acquired a second purported warrant that specified his “cameras”.</p> <p>It is also in this context that no such raids or searches were performed against Obadiah Moyo, the former government minister whose corruption Chin’ono exposed so irrefutably that a protective, reluctant Mnangagwa had to fire him when the pressure became unbearable; an Obadiah Moyo who then appeared at court unhandcuffed, while Hopewell, the whistleblower against him, was handcuffed for his punitively drawn-out appearances at bail court.</p> <p>And no arrests have been effected against those implicated in the diversion of funds from so-called command agriculture.</p> <p>So, it is a context in which Mnangagwa’s regime thrives on lies, on smoke and mirrors, using the law and institutions of justice not as the testaments they should be to any people’s vision of belonging, fairness and dignity, but as knobkerries and carrots at the beck and call of a temperamental emperor.</p> <p>Such lies used to fool some, for some time. But they have now created an environment of lawlessness and injustice – an environment that, sadly, has made responsible investors think twice about bringing capital to Zimbabwe. When a regime shoots itself in the foot as Mnangagwa’s is doing, the foreign investment that comes to its country is, typically, crudely extractive: blood contracts, in effect, cynically calculated to hollow out a nation’s natural resources in exchange for supporting its rulers with military tanks, guns and ammunition, other apparatuses of political and social repression, and fat personal bank accounts.</p> <p>Tawanda Mutasah is an international lawyer and a recipient of the International Bar Association’s International Rule of Law Award.</p>",3

874653122,Western countries raise concerns over Saudi rights record,2019-09-23 12:11:06,"<p>GENEVA (Reuters) - Two dozen mainly European countries voiced concern on Monday at alleged torture, unlawful detentions and unfair trials of critics, including women activists and journalists, in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The empty seats for the delegation of Saudi Arabia are seen during a session of the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Marina Depetris</p> <p>It was the second joint statement criticizing the kingdom read out at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva in six months, following the first censure of Saudi Arabia at the forum in March.</p> <p>The new statement urged Saudi authorities to establish the truth about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in October and ensure the perpetrators were held to account.</p> <p>Fifteen European Union members, including Britain and Germany, were among the signatories, as well as Canada, New Zealand, and Peru, diplomats said. France, Italy and Spain did not sign.</p> <p>There was no immediate response from the Saudi delegation, which is among the U.N. rights council’s 47 member states but was absent when the statement was read out.</p> <p>The kingdom has regularly denied allegations of torture and unfair detention.</p> <p>The joint statement acknowledged Saudi reforms, including the announcement last month that restrictions on the rights of women to travel will be lifted.</p> <p>“However, we remain deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. Civil society actors in Saudi Arabia still face persecution and intimidation,” Australia’s ambassador Sally Mansfield said, reading out the statement.</p> <p>“We are concerned at reports of torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, unfair trials and harassment of individuals engaged in promoting and defending human rights, their families and colleagues,” she said.</p> <p>Lina al-Hathloul later appealed for the release of her sister Loujain, a prominent women’s rights activist who had campaigned for an end to a ban on women driving. Loujain was jailed in May 2018, weeks before the kingdom lifted the ban.</p> <p>“She was eager to engage with the government to improve the rights of fellow women citizens.

He spoke to Green Left’s Chloe de Silva from the Kangaroo Point hotel detention in Brisbane in February.</p> <p>On March 1, he was one of the 25 people released. “I arrived from Manus Island to Kangaroo Point, Brisbane on November 7th 2019 under the Medevac laws. Today, I am being released after almost 8 years!</p> <p>“I am really happy for my freedom this morning! I’m really excited about my freedom!

Medevac refugee: ‘We are not treated like human beings’</p> <p>Back in February, Hossein told me he considered himself lucky to be determined a refugee by the Australian Border Force as part of Operation Sovereign Borders.</p> <p>“I passed the interview and the rules which decide who is a genuine refugee. Many people from my country got negative statements. I was one of the lucky people who received a positive statement; it means I cannot be sent back to my country, back to danger.</p> <p>“I arrived from Manus to Kangaroo Point, Brisbane on November 7, 2019 under the Medevac law. Now, I’m still here. I received 3 months of treatment, then the treatment finished.”</p> <p>Hossein talked about his nightmares from making the dangerous journey by boat from Bangladesh, to Indonesia, to Christmas Island for 18 days, and then being stuck on Papua New Guinea for 6 and a half years.</p> <p>“I was only 21 when I came to Australia; I was so young. Now I am 27 years old and am still stuck. It’s been a very hard time and I’m so frustrated. I get 2 hours of sleep. I dream I am still in the ocean, and I need my freedom and my safety.”</p> <p>Like many other Medevac refugees who have been in hotel prison for almost two years, Hossein made the heartbreaking decision to voluntarily go back to Papua New Guinea because, as he said, “This government is cruel and is punishing innocent people”.</p> <p>He said the process is designed to silence refugees. “When we call our case manager, we are given no update. They just say they are processing, or they stay quiet. No one is helping us, they don’t care”.</p> <p>Hossein described the Department of Home Affairs and Serco, which runs the detention regime, as a “huge, human business”, which is profiting from misery.</p> <p>“Serco, Australian Border Force, case workers, Scott Morrison, Tony Abbott, Peter Dutton, everyone [is the] same: all torture and with no compassion, no human heart.”</p> <p>Hossein left his father, mother and three younger brothers behind in Bangladesh. His father has since died. “I am responsible for all of my family. They are so worried about me and how long I stay in the detention. If I talk to them, they cry.”</p> <p>“Thank you for supporting us and fighting for all refugees. Many Australians are kind and you do your best to keep fighting. Everyone is watching your protests.”</p> <p>Referring to the mainstream media, Monir said he doesn’t trust it. “Sky news, BBC, Seven News, Nine News … the media is so racist. It tells people to ‘follow the government’.</p> <p>“We’ve been stuck here for 8 years and this detention is funded by the government and our struggle as refugees and our suffering is [hardly] mentioned by media.”</p> <p>When Green Left spoke to Hossein in February, he was starting to lose hope. He said it was difficult to keep his spirits up.</p> <p>“We continue to suffer 24 hours a day. I didn’t get any treatment and I might go back to PNG. At least there we had more freedom. Here, there is no treatment, no sunlight and we suffer mentally. This is my story.”</p>",3
937583279,How a Police Spy’s Stunning Testimony Threatens the Official US-Israeli AMIA Bombing Narrative,2020-07-27 00:00:00,"<p>Reprinted from The Grayzone with the author’s permission.</p> <p>The July 18, 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, Argentina was one of the worst pre-9/11 terrorist attacks in the Western hemisphere, killing 85 and injuring 300.</p> <p>For over a quarter century, the US and Israeli governments have blamed Iran for the bloodshed, citing it as primary evidence of Tehran’s role as the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism.</p> <p>This narrative remains part of the propaganda offensive against Iran, and has been exploited by the Donald Trump administration to justify a campaign of economic strangulation aimed at either destabilizing the Islamic Republic or achieving regime change.</p> <p>Soon after the bombing, the United States and Israel placed heavy pressure on the Argentine government to implicate Iran. At the time, however, officials in the embassy in Buenos Aires were well aware there was no hard evidence to support such a conclusion.</p> <p>In an August 1994 cable to the State Department, US Ambassador James Cheek boasted of the “steady campaign” the embassy had waged that “kept the Iranians in the dock where they belong.” In a striking comment to this writer in 2007, Cheek conceded, “To my knowledge, there was never any real evidence” of Iranian responsibility.</p> <p>Bill Brencick, the chief of the political section in the US embassy from 1994 to 1997, also acknowledged in a 2007 interview that US insinuations of Iranian responsibility were based solely on a “wall of assumptions” that had “no hard evidence to connect those assumptions to the case.”</p> <p>Brencick recalled that he and other US officials recognized “enough of a Jewish community [in Buenos Aires] and a history of anti-Semitism that local anti-Semites had to be considered as suspects.” But this line of investigation was never pursued in any official capacity, likely because it contradicted the interests of a US national security state that was dead-set on indicting Iran for the bombing.</p> <p>However, a dramatic development has threatened to upend the official US-Israeli narrative on the AMIA attack. In 2014, the public learned that a former spy who had infiltrated the Jewish community in Buenos Aires on behalf of Argentina’s Federal Police had revealed to two investigative journalists that he had been ordered to turn over blueprints to the AMIA building to his Federal Police case officer.</p> <p>The spy was convinced the building plans were used by the real culprits behind the bombing. His stunning revelation prompted a series of articles in the Argentine press.</p> <p>The former infiltrator’s account provided the first clear indication that anti-Semitic veterans of Argentina’s “Dirty War” and their allies in the Argentine police and intelligence service orchestrated the explosion.</p> <p>But Argentina’s legal system – still heavily influenced by the intelligence agency that influenced the official investigation to blame Iran and a prosecutor whose career had been based on that premise – stubbornly refused to investigate the former police spy’s account.</p> <p>Infiltration, torture, anti-Semitic conspiracies</p> <p>The former police infiltrator, Jose Alberto Perez, believed the AMIA building blueprints he had provided to the Federal Police were used by those who planned the bombing. He had learned from his police counter-terrorism training course that such building plans could be valuable tools for planning such an operation.</p> <p>Perez was also convinced that the bomb had detonated inside the building, rather than in front, and had been placed in the interior of the AMIA building through a gap between it and a neighboring building. Experts of Argentina’s Gendarmerie had come to the same conclusion, and leaked it to Clarin, Argentina’s largest tabloid, just two days after the bombing.</p> <p>Perez also provided crucial evidence that those who had used him to spy on Jewish community leaders were motivated by the same anti-Semitic beliefs that had led the Argentine military dictatorship to single out Jews for especially cruel treatment during the “dirty war” in the 1970s: his case officer, whom he knew only as “Laura”, had ordered him to find out as much he could from the Jewish community about the so-called “Andinia Plan.”</p> <p>According to that alleged plan, Jewish immigrants and foreign Zionists had been secretly plotting to take control of the vast Patagonia region of southern Argentina and create a Jewish state to be called “Andinia.”</p> <p>The myth of the “Andinia Plan” followed the rise of anti-Semitism as a major social force in Argentina during the 1930s and became a staple of the anti-Semitic right’s narrative during the heyday of military domination of the Argentine society and politics from the 1960s through the “dirty war” against leftists in the 1970s.</p> <p>At least 12 percent of those subjected to interrogation, torture, and murder during the dirty war were Jews, according to an investigation by the Barcelona-based Commission of Solidarity with Relatives of the Disappeared, although they represented only 1 percent of the population. Nearly all were interrogated about the “Andinia Plan.”</p> <p>The crusading Argentine journalist Jacobo Timerman, who was born to Jewish parents and whose newspaper provided critical coverage of the military regime’s “dirty war,” was among those detained in the junta’s secret prisons.</p> <p>Timerman recalled in his memoir how he was asked repeatedly to reveal what he knew about the “Andinia Plan” during extended interrogation and torture sessions. His interrogator refused to accept his answer that it was merely a fiction.</p> <p>Meanwhile Israel, which maintained strong military and political ties to the Argentine Junta throughout the dirty war, remained silent about the Jewish journalist’s detention throughout the war.</p> <p>“Iosi” goes to the press</p> <p>Jose Alberto Perez, for his part, was wracked with guilt about having enabled the AMIA terror bombing. He had become an integral part of the Jewish community, studying Hebrew for three years, marrying a Jewish woman who was the secretary of an Israeli Embassy official and even taking the Jewish version of his Spanish surname, Jose. Within the Jewish community, he was known as “Iosi” Perez.</p> <p>As he fell into despair, Iosi contacted investigative journalists Miriam Lewin and Horacio Lutzky to ask their help. The two journalists had tried for years to find a foreign sponsor to grant the former spy asylum abroad but to no avail.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Iosi had secretly taped a video with the prominent Argentine journalist Gabriel Levinas in which he narrated his work penetrating the Jewish community and the unusual request for the blueprints. Levinas posted the video online in early July 2014, just prior to the publication of the second edition of his own book on the AMIA bombing, which included Iosi’s story.</p> <p>The release of that video prompted Lewin and Lutzky to arrange for Iosi to join Argentina’s Witness Protection Program. The two journalists also urged Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who had spent a decade accusing Iran of the bombing, to meet Iosi in person.</p> <p>But according to Lewin, Nisman would only agree to speak with Iosi on the phone. The prosecutor insisted on having three of his employees interview Iosi in person, she recalled in an interview with The Grayzone, then signed a declaration about that July 2014 meeting as though he had been present, and “did not show interest in interrogating him any further.” Iosi entered the Witness Protection Program the same day as the interview, according to Lewin.</p> <p>Iosi’s Federal Police case officer “Laura,” who was retired by then, was released by the minister of security from the normal secrecy requirement about Iosi’s work. But she rejected Iosi’s testimony, according to Lewin, claiming his reports had been judged “poor.” Her claims stood in stark contrast to the actual reports obtained by prosecutors which clearly showed his findings had been evaluated as “excellent” year after year.</p> <p>Lewin told The Grayzone she was confident that Iosi would have been able to provide “solid information about the local connection of the bombing,” but none of the four prosecutors who inherited the unsolved AMIA case after Nisman’s death were willing to follow up on the leads he provided.</p> <p>Lewin noted that several of the senior Federal Police officials who would have been involved in the decisions to infiltrate the Jewish Community and request the AMIA blueprints were still active in 2015. That fact helps to explain why the case was left to die despite Iosi’s explosive revelations.</p> <p>SIDE covers the junta’s back</p> <p>Another key factor in the corruption of the AMIA investigation was the role of the state intelligence agency, known as SIDE, in influencing the lead prosecutor, Judge Juan Jose Galeano. Not only was a special unit within SIDE tasked with overseeing the Galeano’s investigation, another SIDE unit operated directly inside Galeano’s office, as journalist Sergio Kiernan reported.</p> <p>SIDE proceeded to exploit its power to divert attention away from the logical suspects within the junta, circling the wagons to protect its own.</p> <p>As Sergio Moreno and Laura Termine reported in the daily La Prensa, November 28, 1994, the SIDE unit handling the AMIA investigation was notorious for its hatred of Jews. The group consisted of veterans of the dirty war known as the “Cabildo” group, their name inspired by a right wing anti-Semitic magazine published in the early 1980s that had republished an infamous tract detailing the “Andinia Plan” conspiracy.</p> <p>The chief of the Cabildo group unsuccessfully sued Moreno and Termine for labeling his unit anti-Semitic. Following complaints by Jewish community leaders about the Cabildo group’s role in the AMIA investigation, it was removed from the case – but not before it deflected public attention away from leaders of the dirty war and onto an alleged Iranian conspiracy.</p> <p>SIDE’s PR strategy depended on the theory that the AMIA explosion emanated from a vehicle-born suicide bomb, thereby casting suspicion on Iran and its ally, Hezbollah.</p> <p>The intelligence services claimed a white light commercial van had been used in the bombing. Its engine was supposedly found in the rubble on April 25, a week after the explosion.</p> <p>The identification number on the engine was traced to Carlos Alberto Telleldin, the Shia owner of a shady “chop shop” operation that rebuilt damaged cars for sale. Telleldin was accused of being an accessory to the terror plot and jailed on other charges.</p> <p>But the official AMIA case files revealed that Telleldin had been targeted before the AMIA bombing. This stunning fact was noticed by a “private prosecutor” hired by the organization of AMIA victims Memoria Activa.</p> <p>According to a close analysis of the official evidence by Alberto L. Zuppi, a request by Federal Police to wiretap Telleldin’s phone was issued on April 25 – at least five days before the alleged discovery of the engine that led investigators to blame Telleldin.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed the AMIA explosion, more evidence surfaced that pointed to Telledin’s role as a patsy.</p> <p>In September 1994, five Lebanese nationals were detained as they tried to leave Argentina for Paraguay. Through a series of leaks, SIDE planted stories in the media suggesting the suspects were linked to a terrorist network.</p> <p>The following month, a part-time agent for SIDE and former chief of a notorious prison camp where suspects were tortured during the “dirty war,” Captain Hector Pedro Vergez, began visiting Telleldin in prison.</p> <p>In four meetings between September 1994 and January 1995, Vergez offered the jailed suspect $1 million and his freedom if he would identify two of the Lebanese nationals who were then detained in Paraguay as having purchased the van from him – thus making it possible to accuse them of the bombing. But Telleldin refused to lie, and the SIDE plan was derailed.</p> <p>It was not long, however, before SIDE and Galeano initiated a new plan to implicate two Buenos Aires provincial policemen as Iranian-sponsored culprits.</p> <p>Resorting to bribery, Mossad info, and MEK sources to blame Iran</p> <p>In July 1996, Juan Jose Galeano personally visited Carlos Telleldin in prison and offered him $400,000 to blame the two police officers. The scandalous scene was captured in a video shown on Argentine television in 1997.</p> <p>SIDE was actively involved in the cover-up operation, with agency director Hugo Anzorreguy approving a direct payment to Telleldin’s wife.</p> <p>The case against the two policemen was thrown out in court in 2004, but Galeano and Anzorreguy went unpunished for another 15 years. It was not until 2019 that they were sentenced to prison terms for their role in the affair, highlighting the culture of impunity that surrounded SIDE.</p> <p>Once the Galeano case imploded, Alberto Nisman attempted to craft yet another narrative blaming Iran for the bombing. For this, he depended on information provided by Israel’s Mossad to Jaime Stiuso, the SIDE official in charge of counterintelligence.</p> <p>Nisman’s 2006 indictment of seven Iranian officials for the terror plot relied completely on the claims of senior members of the Mujahedin-E-Khalq (MEK), the Israeli and Saudi-backed Iranian exile cult.</p> <p>Not only were none of the MEK members in any position to provide reliable information about a supposedly high-level Iranian plot because they had been actively engaged in a terrorist campaign of their own against the Islamic government by helping Iraq’s then-President Saddam Hussein select targets in Iran.</p> <p>Nisman’s reliance on such unscrupulous sources demonstrated his own apparent determination to reach preordained conclusions about Iran’s guilt. It was hardly a surprise, then, that Nisman ignored Iosi’s revelatory testimony.</p> <p>Nisman’s other major source, Jaime Stiuso of SIDE, was a notorious manipulator who had spent years collecting wiretaps on Argentine politicians. In 2014, the intelligence chief was working to build a case against President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for supposedly conspiring with Iran to eliminate the official Argentine accusation of Iranian guilt. Few observers believed the case would hold up under close scrutiny.</p> <p>In January 2015, Nisman was found dead in his apartment of a gunshot wound to the head. Though political opponents of Kirchner were convinced the prosecutor’s death was the result of a government-sponsored murder, a recent documentary detailing the various investigations of his death, “Nisman: el fiscal, la presidenta y El espía,” concluded that he had committed suicide.</p> <p>By the time of his death, Nisman was helping direct a disinformation campaign that allowed SIDE to cover for shadowy figures from Argentina’s violently anti-Semitic past, and to bury their likely role in the AMIA bombing.</p> <p>Iosi’s testimony should have ended that cover-up, but Nisman, SIDE, and the Federal Police colluded to quash a serious investigation.</p> <p>A quarter-century after the bombing, impunity for the real AMIA terrorists continues.</p> <p>Gareth Porter, an investigative historian and journalist specializing in US national security policy, received the UK-based Gellhorn Prize for journalism for 2011 for articles on the U.S. war in Afghanistan.

998772393,The Pegasus Scandal: Everything You Need To Know,2021-08-10 14:30:36,"<p>Today’s post is the most dour I’ve ever written, and hopefully, it’s the last one of its kind I have to write. We’re going to be discussing the Pegasus Scandal.</p> <p>I make an effort to avoid the news for mental health reasons, but given my profession, I couldn’t escape the news of this story. It was trending on news sites around the world.</p> <p>Despite the popularity of this story, I have found it difficult to find a simple and thorough explanation of the details of the Pegasus Scandal. Which is why I’m writing to you today.</p> <p>In this post, I’m going to cover everything you need to know about this incident in terms that are easy to understand, even if you don’t know much about tech. I’ll also be going into a bit of history on this issue as well as the picture it paints for our future.</p> <p>Let’s start with the facts you need to know first.</p> <p>The Pegasus Scandal: The basics</p> <p>For the first half of this article, I’m just going to cover the critical facts of this story. If you don’t know anything about this scandal, this is a good place to start.</p> <p>What is the Pegasus Scandal?</p> <p>The Pegasus Scandal is the name being given to one of the scariest cybersecurity breaches of our time. “Pegasus” is the name of malware developed by a group known as “NSO”.</p> <p>Pegasus is capable of infecting any major smartphone device of today. That includes the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 as well as most Android smartphones.</p> <p>Once a device has been infected, Pegasus gains access to root permissions for that device. For those that don’t know, root permissions refer to deep administrative control of a device. That includes cameras, microphones, messaging apps, emails, photos and videos, phone calls, contacts, calendars, and GPS data.</p> <p>In other words, root permissions give software access to everything. Ideally, the only software on your iPhone that has access to root permissions is iOS itself. And the only person who can act on those permissions is you and (on rare occasions like iPhone repairs) Apple.</p> <p>In this case, though, Pegasus was able to access and use (and did use) all of these root permissions to spy on users.</p> <p>I normally try to avoid negativity, but it can’t get too much more serious than this. Imagine all of your worst fears about being spied on by your device, and that’s basically what Pegasus has been able to accomplish.</p> <p>Did Apple, Google, and others intentionally participate in the Pegasus Scandal?</p> <p>No, Apple, Google, and other device manufacturers did not knowingly participate in the Pegasus Scandal. At least not as far as we know.</p> <p>Based on the best investigative journalism being conducted at this time, it doesn’t look like any of these major tech companies had anything to do with this. If anything, these companies have been completely turned upside down by this news.</p> <p>Hopefully, the engineers at these businesses are working night and day to stop Pegasus in its tracks as well as prevent future attacks like it.</p> <p>Not only did Apple and others not participate in this, but Apple has made statements disavowing these attacks and asserting that the iPhone is still the most secure mobile device on the market.</p> <p>To be fair, the iPhone probably is still the most secure smartphone out there. But as we’ve learned, that might not be enough anymore. I’ll get into this further in the article.</p> <p>Who is at risk?</p> <p>The one inkling of good news surrounding the Pegasus Scandal (aside from the fact that the story broke at all) is that you probably aren’t at risk. This software was developed for government use, which means that it’s primarily targeting individuals in positions of political power.</p> <p>You should be personally concerned about the effects of Pegasus (regardless of nationality) if you:</p> <p>Hold a political office</p> <p>Are a journalist (especially a political one)</p> <p>Hold political influence</p> <p>Are a member of a military</p> <p>Work for a government (especially with access to sensitive information or permissions)</p> <p>The data that was uncovered and leaked by the journalists who investigated this story (I’ll go into more detail on them later) shows roughly 50,000 individuals who were affected by this scandal.</p> <p>To give you an idea of the severity of the individuals targeted, French President Emmanuel Macron was successfully targeted by Pegasus. He has since changed his phone.</p> <p>You are probably safe</p> <p>For now, this seems to indicate that the vast majority of people around the world are safe from Pegasus software. I’m sure that more than 50,000 people were affected. But there doesn’t seem to be an indication of mass civilian surveillance in this specific case.</p> <p>That said, I would not advise you to relax and forget this story altogether. Although you most likely haven’t been affected, the ramifications of this could certainly have an impact on your life.</p> <p>This software (or another like it) could at a later point in history be deployed at the civilian level en masse. Or one of your political leaders could be targeted, which could impact your national security.</p> <p>Either way, this is big news for everyone around the world. Pegasus is a few years ahead of leading cybersecurity defenses. Until we catch up, this attack and others like it pose a serious threat.</p> <p>You probably won’t know if your device is infected</p> <p>One of the most concerning aspects of the Pegasus Scandal is how difficult it is to learn who is and isn’t infected. Journalists were able to provide a list of affected parties by finding and leaking lists of targets over time. However, they were not able to find a way to detect Pegasus malware on a person’s device.</p> <p>In other words, we have an idea of who was infected because lists of names have been uncovered. This scandal was not exposed, however, by finding the malware on mobile devices.</p> <p>An example that counters this is the Silver Sparrow malware, which was found oppositely. We were able to find it on Mac devices, but it was never discovered where it came from or why it was used.</p> <p>For now, there is little to no way to confirm or deny the presence of Pegasus on your device. Again, it is extremely unlikely that your device has been affected. If you have reason to believe you may be at risk, though (i.e., you’re a member of one of the targeted groups I covered earlier) then it might be worth purchasing a new iPhone and getting rid of your current device completely.</p> <p>How the Pegasus malware works</p> <p>Pegasus malware is what’s known as a “zero-click” attack. That means that the user of the targeted device doesn’t have to do anything to be infected. It can compromise your device without any malicious links, popups, or other deceptive methods. It’s simply sent to a device, and shortly after, the device is infected.</p> <p>From what we know so far, it looks like Pegasus is sent to devices one of two ways.</p> <p>The first is by sending a link to the user via email, text message, or instant messaging (i.e., WhatsApp). Once the user clicks on the link, the infection process begins. In this instance, the attack would not technically be “zero-click”.</p> <p>The second method uses vulnerabilities in common apps. This includes both common third-party apps (like WhatsApp) as well as built-in apps like Apple Music and Photos. While specific details haven’t been uncovered (or released to the public), it was discovered that suspicious activity occurred in both Apple Music and Photos shortly before Pegasus was able to infect the system.</p> <p>How zero-day vulnerabilities work</p> <p>It is believed that Pegasus was able to infect iPhones through built-in iOS apps by looking for “zero-day” vulnerabilities. A zero-day vulnerability is when a hacker starts brute-forcing different attacks on software as soon as it’s released. That way, the hacker can find a vulnerability before the developer can and exploit it.</p> <p>Put simply, when Apple releases a new version of iOS (even an incremental update like iOS 14.7) there is almost always an unforeseen vulnerability. After a few days or weeks, that vulnerability will be uncovered, and before any hackers can exploit it, Apple will release a new update that removes this vulnerability. That’s why you’ll sometimes get back-to-back iOS updates.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are some groups (including Pegasus’s developer NSO) who have the resources and motivations to uncover a vulnerability on the same day that the software is released.</p> <p>So they find the vulnerability, modify Pegasus to exploit that vulnerability, then send Pegasus to the victim. By the time Apple finds and patches the vulnerability, the device is already infected, so the patch is ineffective for that user and other victims.</p> <p>It’s important to note that most of the vulnerabilities in Apple’s software are inevitable. In the same way that it’s impossible to build a pick-proof lock, there is no way for Apple to release a version of iOS that is completely unhackable.</p> <p>That’s why iPhone is considered the “most secure” and not the “completely secure” smartphone. So Apple and co are deserving of a modicum of lenience along with the (appropriately directed) criticism.</p> <p>Some background on Pegasus developer NSO</p> <p>Those are all of the details that you need to know. Now we’re going to get into some finer points as well as discussions on the impact of the Pegasus Scandal. First, let’s explore NSO.</p> <p>As mentioned, NSO is the group that developed the Pegasus malware. They’re based in Israel and have been working on tech like this since the 2010s, which is right around the time that smartphones shifted from a novelty to a necessity.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the recent story on Pegasus is not the first time that NSO has gotten into hot water. Its entire history is filled with controversy and, arguably, crime. Here are some of the “smaller” issues surrounding NSO:</p> <p>In 2012, the Mexican government hired NSO to help it keep tabs on journalists and human rights activists in Mexico (source)</p> <p>In 2018, NSO was accused of helping the Saudi Arabian government spy on human rights group Amnesty International (source)</p> <p>Despite NSO’s Pegasus malware being intended exclusively for use by governments, one of NSO’s staff attempted to sell the software online in exchange for cryptocurrency, highlighting the possibility of Pegasus falling into the wrong hands (of course, it’s debatable whether or not there even are “right hands” for Pegasus to fall into) (source)</p> <p>Other scandals have followed NSO</p> <p>Larger scandals have plagued NSO, too. It has been sued by Facebook-owned WhatsApp for injecting its spyware on the devices of WhatsApp users via the WhatsApp platform (source). The alleged attack affected 1,400 users across 20 countries.</p> <p>Among those users were (you guessed it) numerous journalists and human rights defenders. WhatsApp also claimed to have discovered that these attacks originated from NSO servers. If true, that would seem to indicate that NSO directly used Pegasus to infect these users, not one of NSO’s clients/customers.</p> <p>It is also alleged that the Pegasus software was used to track Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi Arabian government in the months preceding his murder (source). For everyone who remembers, this was an internationally devastating crime. Seeing Pegasus linked to it is no small matter.</p> <p>In short, NSO has been developing the Pegasus surveillance software for the Israeli government over the last decade. The software hasn’t just been used by Israel, however. The Israeli government has been licensing the software to other governments, who have largely been using it to stifle and remove journalists, activists, and human rights defenders.</p> <p>Put another way, NSO appears to be, by all accounts, a perpetrator of dystopian tactics. This may be its biggest scandal yet, but it is by no means an outlier in the group’s history.</p> <p>NSO is refuting claims about its Pegasus software</p> <p>To nobody’s surprise, NSO is refuting the claims surrounding the Pegasus Scandal.</p> <p>Which claims is it refuting? Specifics haven’t been named. The group’s lawyers have simply disavowed the ramifications of its software without discussing specific allegations.</p> <p>All NSO’s lawyers have said so far is that the claims made by the journalists who uncovered and leaked this information are “a compilation of speculative and baseless assumptions.”</p> <p>It’s worth noting that when faced with the allegations surrounding WhatsApp, all NSO had to say was that, “NSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients.” In other words, all it had to say on the matter was that what its customers do with its software isn’t its business.</p> <p>So it looks like NSO is sticking with the tried-and-true “I didn’t do it, and even if I did, it’s not my fault” defense.</p> <p>Apple’s security and privacy claims have forever been called into question</p> <p>I mentioned earlier that I think Apple, Google, and others deserve a bit of leniency when it comes to these sorts of attacks. After all, they are, to a certain extent, inevitable.</p> <p>Apple doesn’t have the power to stop global government-funded organizations from wedging surveillance malware through iOS updates. If Apple could create a hack-proof version of iOS, I’m sure it would’ve done it already.</p> <p>That said, I would not argue that Apple and company are exempt from criticism. I’ve been covering privacy on AppleToolBox and other websites for a long time because it’s arguably the most important challenge facing tech today. And for a long time, Apple has been the best mainstream tech company at preventing these kinds of scandals.</p> <p>Seeing how effective and widespread the Pegasus Scandal is brings new points into the privacy discussion.</p> <p>First, to what extent is Apple responsible? Should it change the way it manufactures its devices and software, and if so, how?</p> <p>Second, it’s safe to say that for all of Apple’s best efforts and marketing slogans, your iPhone isn’t bulletproof. The only way to truly avoid surveillance is to remain a nobody and/or live isolated from modern technology.</p> <p>Third, it highlights how unerringly important it is for political officials to wake up and get educated on cybersecurity and tech issues. While some promising progress is beginning to happen (read here), it’s too slow. New regulations, innovations, and defenses at the administrative level are needed to help stave off the growing threat of cyberattacks.</p> <p>The origin of groups like the NSO</p> <p>The NSO seems to be the most pressing threat to our digital security and privacy for at least the last ten years. It’s too much power in too many hands, all of which seem to be the worst hands available.</p> <p>In the same way that the U.S. government deserves criticism when it sells weapons to bad actors, the Israeli government should be held accountable for where and how Pegasus is distributed, assuming it should even be allowed to be distributed, to begin with.</p> <p>Of course, the Pegasus Scandal is not the first of its kind. Intel and security scandals have plagued the U.S. for the last 50+ years as groups like the FBI, NSA, and CIA have used similar tactics and strategies to target the same groups as Pegasus – rights activists and journalists.</p> <p>It’s hard not to think that the origin of groups like NSO began with inspiration from the spying being conducted by the U.S. and U.K. governments. Both countries were shown to be bad actors on this front thanks to the information leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</p> <p>While many of the programs that were unmasked by Edward Snowden have been (at least “officially”) shutdown, the 2013 leak no doubt inspired countries like Israel and groups like NSO to pursue their ends in this area.</p> <p>Similar to how the development of the atom bomb was shortly copied by every other country with the resources to do so, I imagine that there are lots of Pegasus clones that are copying the previous work of the U.S. government.</p> <p>How the Pegasus Scandal was uncovered</p> <p>The work done to bring the Pegasus Scandal to light is pretty fascinating. It’s certainly one of the most sophisticated instances of investigative journalism that I’ve ever heard of.</p> <p>Following the leak of 50,000 phone numbers in 2020 (which were tied to Pegasus), seventeen media publications joined together to investigate NSO and its software. Among these publications are The Guardian, The Washington Post, Le Monde, Proceso, and The Wire.</p> <p>In total, 80 journalists from these publications investigated this leak for several months. During that time, these journalists partnered with other investigative and forensic services to identify the phone numbers, search through the devices for malware (when possible), and confirmed that the devices were not only being tracked but being tracked by NSO’s software.</p> <p>High-profile individuals from around the world have been targeted, including the President of France Emmanuel Macron, the Prime Minister of Egypt Mostafa Madbouly, and Barham Salih, the President of Iraq.</p> <p>As mentioned, a majority of the targeted individuals are journalists and human rights activists. Alongside the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, there are ties between Pegasus and the imprisonment and torture of Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, the assassination of Mexican anti-corruption journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto, and the leaking of intimate photos of Fatima Movlamli (she was 18 at the time that the photos were leaked), an opposer to local authoritarian rule in Azerbaijan.</p> <p>The work completed by these journalists is equal parts inspiringly brave and devastatingly eye-opening.</p> <p>The future of security and privacy in tech is looking bleak once more</p> <p>For the majority of the 2010s, it was generally accepted that our tech was being used to spy on us. This was confirmed by Edward Snowden’s leak in 2013.</p> <p>After that leak, however, it seemed that things were steadily improving. Apple and others have taken strong stances on protecting their users’ privacy, and despite cynicism, it has seemed that these companies had put their money where their mouth was.</p> <p>Additionally, the U.S. appears to have canceled its previous spying programs, and recent court cases have deemed that the NSA’s surveillance was illegal and potentially unconstitutional.</p> <p>But the Pegasus Scandal seems to show that good intentions in one area do not equal good intentions in all areas. The reformation of some bad actors is not equal to the reformation of all bad actors. And it seems like, at least with the state of the world today, that there is little anyone can do about this.</p> <p>After all of the journalism conducted on this scandal, it has remained conclusive that if someone wants to use the Pegasus software against you, there isn’t anything you can do to stop them short of isolating yourself from tech.</p> <p>The NSO’s excuse for creating and licensing Pegasus</p> <p>According to NSO, the Pegasus software is only meant to be used against terrorist organizations. NSO claims that it vets potential governments before licensing the software to them to reduce the chances that they will use it for ill purposes.</p> <p>That’s hard to believe, though, given that the software was licensed to known bad actors in the Middle East, to the Mexican government (which has a long history of being adversarial to activists), and others. And regardless of NSO’s intentions, the software has been used for evil.</p> <p>It’s difficult to put a positive spin on this story. It seems that, once again, those in positions of power have crafted tools of abuse from the opportunities and resources that power presents. It’s a solemn reminder that the ultimate goal of governments is to collect and maintain power at all costs and in all forms. And it’s a reminder to citizens to stay vigilant, strong-willed, and sharp.</p> <p>Interested in more stories like the Pegasus Scandal?</p> <p>Subscribe to the AppleToolBox newsletter to keep up with the latest news, controversies, and all other things Apple.</p>",3
898601579,Proposal for total ban on deployment of Filipinos to Kuwait wins support,2020-01-12 23:07:18,"<p>WhatsApp Facebook Twitter Email Messenger</p> <p>This post has been read 201096 times!</p> <p>‘Workers on holiday will be stranded’</p> <p>Rev Fr Ben Barrameda officiates the requiem Mass for HSW Jeanelyn Villavenda organised by the FIL-ASEAK at the POLO-Kuwait. Inset: Philippine Labour Attache to Kuwait Nasser Mustafa</p> <p>KUWAIT CITY, Jan 12: Philippine Labor Attache to Kuwait Nasser Mustafa expressed full support on the recommendation of Department of Labour and Employment (DOLE) Secretary Silvestre Bello III to implement a total deployment ban for Filipino workers to Kuwait following the autopsy result of Filipina household service worker Jeanelyn Villavende who was allegedly tortured to death by her Kuwaiti employers.</p> <p>“If you ask me, I have to support the action of Secretary Bello because I believe the Secretary has a basis for that. If we look closely, our fellow Filipino really suffered inhumanely. I have to fully support the action of our good Secretary,” stated Mustafa.</p> <p>Mustafa clarified that as of today, Jan 12, the partial deployment ban stays for newly hired household service workers bound for Kuwait and those returning HSWs whose previous contract expired and are returning to Kuwait under a new employer. “There is no total deployment ban yet awaiting the autopsy result of Jeanelyn Villavende that will be the basis of Secretary Bello’s recommendation for a total ban to the governing board of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration,” he explained.</p> <p>Mustafa outlined the possible implications of a total deployment ban that will also affect the skilled workers in Kuwait especially those who are going home for vacation or are on vacation in the Philippines now. “Should there be a total ban in Kuwait, all those who will be on vacation cannot come back to Kuwait, so this is not only the domestic workers but all category of workers will be covered. May they be newly hired, balik-manggagawa or returning OFWs, they will all be covered by the total ban,” stated Mustafa.</p> <p>He added that he leaves it up to the worker’s discretion if he or she wants to go on vacation pending the Philippine government’s decision on the total deployment ban.</p> <p>The looming total deployment ban generated varied reactions among Filipinos in Kuwait. “I haven’t seen any advisory yet that skilled workers cannot come back to Kuwait. Of course, I’m a bit wary but I believe our government will help us,” stated Katrine Tan who is fl ying to Manila today for her annual vacation.</p> <p>In the meantime – the Filipino Association of Secretaries of Employment Agencies in Kuwait, a group composed of manpower agency secretaries that deploys household service workers in Kuwait held a Mass officiated by Rev Fr Ben Barrameda on Saturday at the Philippine Overseas Labour Office in Kuwait in honor of Villavende. The group has issued an appeal to the Philippine government.</p> <p>By Michelle Fe Santiago Arab Times Staff</p>",3
879221242,Homage to Ana Real: the Nicaraguan Journalist who Earned two Emmy’s.,2019-10-12 16:09:30,"<p>She was a successful television news editor and producer on CBS. In the United States, they paid homage to her legacy with a place in the Hispanic Journalism Hall of Fame.</p> <p>By Ivette Munguia (Confidencial)</p> <p>HAVANA TIMES – Nicaraguan Ana Real paid for three dinners in Manhattan in order to obtain the interview that television anchor Dan Rather held with then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Although she’d been promised an interview while in Cuba, that promise wasn’t enough to convince this television producer, who would have to transfer the crew and equipment from the United States to Iraq. In the end, though, despite the fact that television channels all over the world were fighting to get an interview, she was the only one to achieve this for CBS.</p> <p>Ana was 60 years old when she died last March 27. She had been with CBS since 2001, most currently as the foreign news producer for CBS News. She was always true to her convictions and, as her husband Miguel Real recalls: “She did things because she wanted to do them; she didn’t need anyone’s approval.” He adds that things in the US culture don’t usually work like that, but “it worked for her”.</p> <p>Interviewing Hussein was a main aspiration for all of the most powerful television channels in the world during 2003. Ana glimpsed the possibility of landing such an interview when she travelled to Cuba with her CBS News team to interview Fidel Castro. On that occasion, the Cuban regime disappointed her seconds before the interview, after having promised them an exclusive. She was furious, and yelled at them – “Hypocrites! You’re all full of crap.” Everyone there was horrified, until Castro’s lawyer approached her.</p> <p>“Ana, take it easy. If I could give you something, what would you ask for?” he asked her.</p> <p>“If I could ask you for anything, I’d like an interview with Saddam Hussein,” she responded.</p> <p>When Ana returned from Cuba, she pitched the idea of the interview with Hussein to CBS News, but no one believed it would be possible. There was about a one percent chance of obtaining what many considered impossible, but she was convinced that they had nothing to lose, and if they did get the interview, they had a lot to gain.</p> <p>Ana had a broad network of contacts around the world, which she had gathered through the work she did. Those contacts and her skill at “asking and landing things” were the levers she used in a Manhattan restaurant to “obtain…the interview with Saddam Hussein, at a time when there were thousands of international media outlets seeking such an interview,” explains Miguel.</p> <p>He also attributes to her the incomparable coverage CBS provided on the arrest of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, head of the Mexican cartel. She also produced in-depth stories about the survivors of the earthquake in Haiti, and about the questionable practices of the international adoption agencies, reports that won her two Emmy’s.</p> <p>Her first steps</p> <p>Before her successful career as a television producer in the U.S., Ana and her husband Miguel spent time in a number of countries in Latin America, covering stories and reporting on major events for international agencies. They informed about wars, natural disasters, and on two occasions they had to flee authoritarian regimes who were unhappy with the investigative work that Miguel did.</p> <p>Ana began in the world pf journalism without having planned to do so. In 1984, as a recent graduate in Hotel Administration her vision was aimed more at working in tourism and the service industry.</p> <p>She returned to Nicaragua after studying in the United States and found work at the Intercontinental Hotel, the largest and most prestigious of the era. However, the war brought the arrival of dozens of journalists and international agencies, who installed themselves in the Managua hotel. This tied her to the call to tell the stories, and she never looked back.</p> <p>“I helped them with contacts and logistics. Suddenly, I found myself involved more with journalism than with the hotel business, and I began as a “freelance producer”, Ana recalled during a 2015 interview with Confidencial.</p> <p>Among the reporters that were covering the war in Nicaragua was Mexican Miguel Real. He and Ana met in a bar that was right next door to the hotel where she was working. They became good friends, and he invited her to Guatemala. She had been planning to get married, but Miguel persuaded her to accompany him for a week. While they were in Guatemala, Miguel was dispatched to Mexico to cover the 1985 earthquake there. Ana went with him. “That’s when she really began her career, when she discovered a taste for journalism,” Miguel recalls.</p> <p>Ana’s wedding was cancelled, and she began her relationship with Miguel. “We went to live in El Salvador,” recounts her widower. At the end of the decade of the 80s, Ana was working as a freelancer for the international news channels that came to cover the war in El Salvador.</p> <p>She later traveled to Venezuela, Columbia, all over Central America, and the Caribbean, among other countries. During the nineties, the family settled in Peru, but they were later expelled by the regime of Alberto Fujimori due to Miguel’s investigative work.</p> <p>After their abrupt departure from Peru, Ana, together with her spouse and children, moved to the United States. There she worked first for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Later, in 2001, she joined CBS, the Columbia Broadcasting System.</p> <p>She was passionate about her work. She would answer the telephone 24 hours a day, even though this habit caused some marital discussions. For her, the production was “the heart of the story,” as she told Confidencial magazine in 2015.</p> <p>She touched the life of many people</p> <p>Ana’s passion for journalism went beyond her work. She became a mentor for many people; she led teams of reporters all over the world; and she was president of the local chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in New York City, advising young journalism students.</p> <p>“She helped them present themselves, not to diminish themselves in front of the US industry people. She’d tell them that they had to be themselves, that we have worth as Latinos,” Miguel remembers.</p> <p>In a posthumous homage held at the beginning of September, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists hung the name of Ana Real in the Hispanic Journalists’ Hall of Fame, a distinction that has also been received by journalists such as Rosental Alves, founder and director of the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, and Maria Elena Salinas.</p> <p>In the same event, Ingrid Ciprian-Mathews, executive vice president of professional strategic development for CBS News, emphasized: “Undoubtedly, Ana was special. She had distinctive qualities that made her unforgettable to her many friends, colleagues, apprentices, and acquaintances all over the world.”</p> <p>“Through her charm, curiosity and ingenuity, she always got the story. And through her disarming sense of identification with other people, she faced up to all the challenges, because her objective was the story. This scholarship will continue her legacy and inspire the next generation of journalists,” Ciprian-Matthews continued.</p> <p>Alberto B. Mendoza, executive director of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists emphasized: “Ana was an incredibly talented journalist who always saw the best in the students and really believed in them and in their success within the field. Those who had the opportunity to know her were anxious to learn from her, and the students who receive this scholarship will have the honor of following in the steps of one of the most influential leaders of journalism.”</p> <p>Another way of honoring Ana Real’s legacy was by creating a scholarship fund for journalism students in the United States. The first two scholarships will be awarded starting in 2020, and the winners will receive $5,000 to be used for tuition, lodging, food and books.</p> <p>Nicaraguan journalist Tifani Roberts feels that Ana “reached the top”. She never went on the air herself, but, as Roberts noted: “she had a lot of influence behind the scenes: What would be covered? How would it be covered?”</p> <p>During the outbreak of the civic rebellion in Nicaragua, “Ana Clemencia pushed and pushed. CBS became the only one of the US broadcast networks to send their foreign news teams to Nicaragua to cover the crisis. That was thanks to her,” Roberts states.</p> <p>She adds that the last time she saw Ana, she was there with her team from CBS News conducting interviews outside of El Chipote, an infamous jail in Nicaragua, where many of the protesters were held and tortured.</p> <p>Her husband, Miguel Real, also believes that “Ana’s frustrated dream” was to see the fall of Daniel Ortega’s regime, but she didn’t live long enough.</p> <p>Unique, determined, proactive, generous</p> <p>Long before becoming a successful news producer, traveling the world and molding dozens of journalists, Ana Clemencia Padilla (her maiden name) was a young girl from the middle classes who enjoyed interacting with the tourists that passed through the port town of Corinito, the most important port in Nicaragua during the era of cotton growing. That’s where she spent her early years, due to the work of her father, Jose Padilla Ramirez, who was at that time a well-known physician.</p> <p>Born in Managua on September 24, 1958, she was the youngest of four children from the marriage of Dr. Jose Padilla and Rafaela Lopez de Padilla. Sometime later, the family moved to Corinto. She had a happy childhood, and “was a generous person,” recalls her sister Patricia Padilla.</p> <p>Ana Patricia’s voice breaks when she remembers Ana. She pauses and later says: “[She was] my soul sister. We were best friends, we loved each other so much, we were close.”</p> <p>When Ana and her brothers and sisters were teenagers, the family returned to Managua. She was about to graduate from high school when her school collapsed during the earthquake that destroyed Managua in 1972. She finished high school in an improvised classroom.</p> <p>In the mid-seventies, the revolutionary movement against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza gained strength, and Ana’s parents decided to send her to the United States to avoid her getting involved. In that country she lived with different families, learned English, and later was able to study tourism.</p> <p>While Ana and Miguel were traveling the world and reporting on the most important events, they also had two children, Ana Carolina and Miguel. “We were a different kind of parents,” Miguel recalls, explaining that his children grew up amid wars and natural disasters, until the family finally decided to put down roots in the United States.</p> <p>Optimistic until the end</p> <p>On March 27, 2019, five months after she was diagnosed with leukemia, Ana Real passed away. She was 60. The illness surprised her during a vacation trip to Mexico, but she was convinced that she’d beat the cancer. However, her body couldn’t resist the bone marrow transplant, and she died from multiple organ failure.</p> <p>Ana’s leukemia was “a scientific case study,” Miguel explains. Her type of leukemia is little known since her bone marrow was apparently clear of cancerous cells, but in some way or another they were producing the disease. That’s why she decided to submit to a bone marrow transplant that her body in the end couldn’t hold up under.</p> <p>“Really, until minutes before her death, we were certain that everything was going to come out well,” recounts Miguel. The strength that Ana transmitted to her loved ones made them think that everything would be alright.</p> <p>Her sister Patricia says: “Ana was so generous that she never told us the seriousness of her illness, although she knew it. She was battling, but I think that she didn’t want to have her loved ones close to her, because we would be suffering.”</p> <p>Ana Real wasn’t very religious, but she was very spiritual. She lived her life to the limit and served others, determined as only she could be. Only the disease could put an end to the life of one of the most outstanding Nicaraguan journalists in the international media.</p>",3
1001797753,Inside Myanmar’s Daily Junta Reality,2021-08-31 05:17:47,"<p>Myanmar’s military leaders used its armed forces to launch its coup and take control of the country from its elected government on February 1, 2021. In protest, millions of people took to the streets. The military responded to these protests by sending armed soldiers and police into residential areas to arrest defiant civilians, workers, students, doctors and nurses.</p> <p>In March, martial law was enforce in Yangon, snipers were used, and protestors were shot on sight.</p> <p>To restrict news coverage of their crimes and to impede the organisatiojn of protests, the military ordered telecommunication companies to restrict internet and mobile phone coverage. Independent media outlets had their licenses withdrawn, offices were raided and thrashed. Journalists were targeted and hunted by soldiers and police. Obscure laws were added to the penal code and used to restrict freedom of speech and expression. State-controlled media published pages of arrest warrants and photographs of the wanted, including journalists.</p> <p>To avoid arrest, independent journalists went underground or sought refuge with border based ethnic armed organizations.</p> <p>Myanmar journalists are well aware that being ‘arrested’ and held in detention by the military doesn’t come with respect for their legal or human rights. The military uses a wide range of obscure laws, some dating back to colonial times, to detain, intimidate and silence its critics – academics, medics, journalists, students and workers.</p> <p>Independent website, Reporting ASEAN, recorded that, as of August 18, 95 journalists had been arrested and 42 were being held in detention.</p> <p>The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) estimated by August 29, that the military has now killed at least 1,026 people, arrested 7,627, issued warrants for 1,984 and are still holding 6,025 in detention.</p> <p>Sithu Aung Myint and Htet Htet Khine pictured in a newspaper clipping. Credit: Global New Light of Myanmar.</p> <p>They want names</p> <p>Those arrested are taken to interrogation centres and held indefinitely without contact with family or legal representation. Torture is used to extort names and contacts from the detained to be added to the military’s long list of those to be hunted down and suppressed into silence.</p> <p>One of those names on the military’s wanted list is that of journalist Nyan Linn Htet, now in hiding, after a warrant under Section 505 (a) was issued for his arrest.</p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet, managing editor of Mekong News, in an interview with the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) explains the impact of being hunted has had on both him and his family.</p> <p>“If I’m arrested it means I lose everything. When we had to run and go into hiding, we lost our home and our possessions. You lose your income. Your equipment. You never feel safe when hiding. Living like this affects all of us. If the military does not find me, they will pressure and threaten my family with arrest.”</p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet said he is still working despite the risk of arrest.“Losing a journalist is a big loss for our struggle for democracy. We’re only doing our job as reporters, but our news coverage exposes the military and its abuses – this is why we’re the enemy.”</p> <p>Despite the danger to him and his family, Nyan Linn Htet worries about the safety of those who helped him avoid arrest. “If I’m caught in hiding, the SAC (military-appointed State Administration Council) will persecute the people who gave me a place to live. I’m afraid they [the military] will arrest those who helped me.”</p> <p>His fears are well founded.</p> <p>Journalist and political analyst Sithu Aung Myint was high on the military’s wanted list for his political commentary and published opposition to the coup. On Sunday August 15, the military raided the home of his colleague, BBC freelance producer, Htet Htet Khine, and arrested both of them. A week later, in its Sunday August 21 edition, the military-run newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said Sithu Aung Myint had been charged with sedition, spreading ‘fake news’ and being critical of the military coup leaders and its State Administration Council under Sections 505 (a) and 124 (a) of the Penal Code. He could be sentenced to life in jail under Section 124 (a) of the penal code. Htet Htet Khine was arrested for giving shelter to Sithu Aung Myint, and charged under section 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act for working with the recently formed National Union Government’s radio station, Federal FM.</p> <p>Friends and colleagues of Sithu Aung Myint and Htet Htet Khine told IFJ they are concerned both journalists were held at an interrogation centre for over a week before having access to either legal help or contact with colleagues or family.</p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet told IFJ he is aware his legal and human rights will not be respected if he is arrested. “They will not let us get legal help until they’ve got what they want from us. The military amended 505 (a) of the Penal Code to prevent giving us bail. We know they will jail us even if we have legal representation. We know SAC is torturing journalists because of the work we do.”</p> <p>Reports by local and international humanitarian groups have detailed the severe beatings – hours of maintaining stressed positions, use of sexual violence – and killing of people while held in detention.</p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet said if arrested, he knows it will come with beatings. He admits that the thought of being tortured keeps him awake at night. “They will jail me, but only after they torture me. I will not be released until I sign a statement that I will never criticize them. I’m not afraid of being arrested, but torture scares me. There are nights when I’m too afraid to sleep.”</p> <p>He and other local journalists told the IFJ it was disappointing that international media has dropped Myanmar from its news agenda and moved on to cover other stories.</p> <p>Nyan Linn Htets said despite access difficulties, the international media can use local reporters who are willing to help. “We know the difficulties media has getting ground access to Myanmar. Covid-19 restrictions also make it impossible to legally cross borders from neighboring countries, but we are already here in the country and are capable of doing the job.”</p> <p>Despite the fear of arrest and torture, he is still reporting and urged local journalists to keep doing the same. “It’s important we use what we can to still work and report news events of interest to people. People are accessing news and information in many different ways now.”</p> <p>The military, while thrashing local and international laws and ignoring its constitution, is quick to use and amend laws to jail its opponents for being critical of the coup and for reporting military violence, abuse and corruption.</p> <p>We have no rights</p> <p>Nan Paw Gay, editor-in-chief at Karen Information Center, said the military council has no respect for journalists or their right to publish information in the public interest.</p> <p>“There is no freedom of the press. If journalist’s try to report news or seek information from the military’s opponents – CRPH, NUG, CDM, G-Z and PDF – the State Administration Council prosecutes them under Section 17/1 of the Illegal Association Act. Since the military launched its coup, sources we use have had their freedom of speech and expression made illegal and they now risk arrest for talking to us and… we can be arrested for speaking with them. Independent media groups have been outlawed and totally lost their right to speak freely or write about news events.”</p> <p>Nan Paw Gay points out if journalists are “critical of the military, its appointed State Administration Council or its lack of a public health plan to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic now ravaging the country, section 505 (a) is used to arrest journalists for spreading false news.” Essentially torture is used to terrorise journalists, she said.</p> <p>“When the military council arrests and detains journalists, the torture is both physical and psychological. Even before being detained threats are issued and then during the arrest the violence becomes real – shootings, people being kicked and dragged from homes by their hair and beaten.”</p> <p>Nan Paw Gay says women journalists are more likely to be “tortured using psychological abuse – kept in a dark room and constantly told that they will be killed tomorrow – to mess and generate fear with their thoughts. You can see the effects of the tortured on some journalists when they appear in court – shaking hands and body spasms.”</p> <p>Military brutality is a daily reality for Myanmar’s people. At the time of writing, the army is preparing to deploy and reinforce its bases with hundreds of extra troops into areas of the Karen National Union-controlled territory and where anti-coup protestors, striking doctors and politicians have been offered refuge and safety. A senior ethnic Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) soldier told the IFJ that army drones and helicopters have been surveying the area in recent months.</p> <p>“We know they’ve sent munitions and large troop numbers to our area… last time we had drones flying over our area, they later attacked villages and our positions with airstrikes. They’re already fighting in our Brigade 5 and 1 and have started in 6 and 2.”</p> <p>Since the military launched its coup on February 1, there has been at least 500 armed battles between the KNU and the military regime and 70,000 Karen civilians have been displaced and are hiding in makeshift camps as a direct result of these attacks. Fighter jets have flown into Karen National Union-controlled areas 27 times and dropped at least 47 bombs, killing 14 civilians and wounding 28.</p> <p>Naw K’nyaw Paw, general secretary of the Karen Women Organization, in an interview with Karen News, said villagers displaced by the Myanmar Army attacks are now in desperate need of humanitarian aid.</p> <p>“They shoot at villagers if they see them on their farms, burning down their rice barns and killing the livestock left behind. The Burma Army also arrests people when they see them and use them as human shields to protect them when attacked by Karen soldiers.”</p> <p>Naw K’nyaw Paw said accessing the displaced villagers is difficult, especially during the wet season.</p> <p>“The only accessible way in is on foot, supplies have to be carried through jungle. Given the restrictions due to Covid-19 as well as the increasing Burma Army military operations, villagers are unable to return to their homes and they will need food, clothing and medicine, especially the young and old.”</p> <p>Nan Paw Gay says the military’s strategy to muzzle the media is a familiar tactic that has been used before. “Stop international media getting access to conflict areas, shut down independent media, hunt local journalists and when there’s no one to left to report, launch attacks in ethnic regions, displacing thousands of villagers.”</p> <p>———————————————————————————–</p> <p>*Phil Thornton is a journalist and senior adviser to the International Federation of Journalists in South East Asia.

906700659,MENA: Renewed wave of mass uprisings met with brutality and repression during ‘year of defiance’,2020-02-18 11:00:01,"<p>Report reviews human rights in 19 MENA states during 2019</p> <p>Wave of protests across Algeria, Iraq, Iran and Lebanon demonstrates reinvigorated faith in people power</p> <p>500+ killed in Iraq and over 300 in Iran in brutal crackdowns on protests</p> <p>Relentless clampdown on peaceful critics and human rights defenders</p> <p>At least 136 prisoners of conscience detained in 12 countries for online speech</p> <p>Governments across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) displayed a chilling determination to crush protests with ruthless force and trample over the rights of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets to call for social justice and political reform during 2019, said Amnesty International today, publishing its annual report on the human rights situation in the region.</p> <p>Human rights in the Middle East and North Africa: Review of 2019 describes how instead of listening to protesters’ grievances, governments have once again resorted to relentless repression to silence peaceful critics both on the streets and online. In Iraq and Iran alone, the authorities’ use of lethal force led to hundreds of deaths in protests; in Lebanon police used unlawful and excessive force to disperse protests; and in Algeria the authorities used mass arrests and prosecutions to crack down on protesters. Across the region, governments have arrested and prosecuted activists for comments posted online, as activists turned to social media channels to express their dissent.</p> <p>2019 was a year of defiance in MENA. It also was a year that showed that hope was still alive – and that despite the bloody aftermath of the 2011 uprisings in Syria, Yemen and Libya and the catastrophic human rights decline in Egypt – people’s faith in the collective power to mobilize for change was revived Heba Morayef</p> <p>“In an inspiring display of defiance and determination, crowds from Algeria, to Iran, Iraq and Lebanon poured into the streets – in many cases risking their lives – to demand their human rights, dignity and social justice and an end to corruption. These protesters have proven that they will not be intimidated into silence by their governments,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Director for MENA.</p> <p>“2019 was a year of defiance in MENA. It also was a year that showed that hope was still alive – and that despite the bloody aftermath of the 2011 uprisings in Syria, Yemen and Libya and the catastrophic human rights decline in Egypt – people’s faith in the collective power to mobilize for change was revived.”</p> <p>The protests across MENA mirrored demonstrators taking to the streets to demand their rights from Hong Kong to Chile. In Sudan, mass protests were met with brutal crackdowns by security forces and eventually ended with a negotiated political agreement with associations who had led the protests.</p> <p>Crackdown on protests on the streets</p> <p>Across the MENA region authorities employed a range of tactics to repress the wave of protests – arbitrarily arresting thousands of protesters across the region and in some cases resorting to excessive or even lethal force. In Iraq and Iran alone hundreds were killed as security forces fired live ammunition at demonstrators and thousands more were injured.</p> <p>In an inspiring display of defiance and determination, crowds from Algeria, to Iran, Iraq and Lebanon poured into the streets – in many cases risking their lives – to demand their human rights, dignity and social justice and an end to corruption. These protesters have proven that they will not be intimidated into silence by their governments Heba Morayef</p> <p>In Iraq where at least 500 died in demonstrations in 2019, protesters showed tremendous resilience, defying live ammunition, deadly sniper attacks and military tear gas grenades deployed at short range causing gruesome injuries.</p> <p>In Iran, credible reports indicated that security forces killed over 300 people and injured thousands within just four days between 15 and 18 November to quell protests initially sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Thousands were also arrested and many subjected to enforced disappearance and torture.</p> <p>In September, Palestinian women in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories took to the streets to protest against gender-based violence and Israel’s military occupation. Israeli forces also killed dozens of Palestinians during demonstrations in Gaza and the West Bank.</p> <p>“The shocking death tolls among protesters in Iraq and Iran illustrate the extreme lengths to which these governments were prepared to go in order to silence all forms of dissent,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for MENA. “Meanwhile, in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Israel’s policy of using excessive, including lethal, force against demonstrators there continued unabated.”</p> <p>The shocking death tolls among protesters in Iraq and Iran illustrate the extreme lengths to which these governments were prepared to go in order to silence all forms of dissent Philip Luther</p> <p>In Algeria, where mass protests led to the fall of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after 20 years in power, authorities sought to quash protests through mass arbitrary arrests and prosecutions of peaceful demonstrators.</p> <p>While the mass protests in Lebanon since October, which led to the resignation of the government, began largely peacefully, on a number of occasions protests were met with unlawful and excessive force and security forces failed to intervene effectively to protect peaceful demonstrators from attacks by supporters of rival political groups.</p> <p>In Egypt, a rare outbreak of protests in September which took the authorities by surprise was met with mass arbitrary arrests with more than 4,000 detained.</p> <p>“Governments in MENA have displayed a total disregard for the rights of people to protest and express themselves peacefully,” said Heba Morayef.</p> <p>“Instead of launching deadly crackdowns and resorting to measures such as excessive use of force, torture, or arbitrary mass arrests and prosecutions, authorities should listen to and address demands for social and economic justice as well as political rights.”</p> <p>Repression of dissent online</p> <p>As well as lashing out against peaceful protesters on the streets, throughout 2019 governments across the region continued to crack down on people exercising their rights to freedom of expression online. Journalists, bloggers and activists who posted statements or videos deemed critical of the authorities on social media faced arrest, interrogation and prosecutions.</p> <p>Governments in MENA have displayed a total disregard for the rights of people to protest and express themselves peacefully Heba Morayef</p> <p>According to Amnesty International’s figures, individuals were detained as prisoners of conscience in 12 countries in the region and 136 people were arrested solely for their peaceful expression online. Authorities also abused their powers to stop people accessing or sharing information online. During protests in Iran, the authorities implemented a near-total internet shutdown to stop people sharing videos and photos of security forces unlawfully killing and injuring protesters. In Egypt, authorities disrupted online messaging applications in an attempt to thwart further protests. Egyptian and Palestinian authorities also resorted to censoring websites including news websites. In Iran social media apps including Facebook, Telegram, Twitter and YouTube remained blocked.</p> <p>Some governments also use more sophisticated techniques of online surveillance to target human rights defenders. Amnesty’s research highlighted how two Moroccan human rights defenders were targeted using spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. The same company’s spyware had previously been used to target activists in Saudi Arabia and the UAE as well as an Amnesty International staff member.</p> <p>More broadly, Amnesty International recorded 367 human rights defenders subjected to detention (240 arbitrarily detained in Iran alone) and 118 prosecuted in 2019 – the true numbers are likely to be higher.</p> <p>“The fact that governments across MENA have a zero-tolerance approach to peaceful online expression shows how they fear the power of ideas that challenge official narratives. Authorities must release all prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally and stop harassing peaceful critics and human rights defenders,” said Philip Luther.</p> <p>Signs of hope</p> <p>Despite ongoing and widespread impunity across MENA, some small but historic steps were taken towards accountability for longstanding human rights violations. The announcement by the International Criminal Court (ICC) that war crimes had been committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and that an investigation should be opened as soon as the ICC’s territorial jurisdiction has been confirmed offered a crucial opportunity to end decades of impunity. The ICC indicated that the investigation could cover Israel’s killing of protesters in Gaza.</p> <p>The fact that governments across MENA have a zero-tolerance approach to peaceful online expression shows how they fear the power of ideas that challenge official narratives. Authorities must release all prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally and stop harassing peaceful critics and human rights defenders Philip Luther</p> <p>Similarly, in Tunisia the Truth and Dignity Commission published its final report and 78 trials started before criminal courts offering a rare chance for security forces to be held accountable for past abuses.</p> <p>The limited advances in women’s rights, won after years of campaigning by local women’s rights movements, were outweighed by the continuing repression of women’s rights defenders, particularly in Iran and Saudi Arabia, and a broader failure to eliminate widespread discrimination against women. Saudi Arabia introduced long-overdue reforms to its male guardianship system, but these were overshadowed by the fact that five women human rights defenders remained unjustly detained for their activism throughout 2019.</p> <p>Governments across the region must learn that their repression of protests and imprisonment of peaceful critics and human rights defenders will not silence people’s demands for fundamental economic, social and political rights Heba Morayef</p> <p>A number of Gulf states also announced reforms to improve protection for migrant workers including promises from Qatar to abolish its kafala (sponsorship system) and improve migrants’ access to justice. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates also signalled plans to reform the kafala system. However, migrant workers continue to face widespread exploitation and abuse across the region.</p> <p>“Governments across the region must learn that their repression of protests and imprisonment of peaceful critics and human rights defenders will not silence people’s demands for fundamental economic, social and political rights. Instead of ordering serious violations and crimes to stay in power, governments should ensure the political rights needed to allow people to express their socio-economic demands and to hold their governments to account,” said Heba Morayef.</p>",3

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?</p> <p>On February 5, the Senate voted to acquit President Donald J. Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. In other words, Trump’s pre-election boast that he “could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody” and not “lose any voters” proved something more than high-flown hyperbole. (To be fair, he did lose one Republican “voter” in the Senate—Mitt Romney—but it wasn’t enough to matter.)</p> <p>The Senate’s failure to convict the president will only confirm his conception of his office as a seat of absolute power (which, as we’ve been told, “corrupts absolutely”). This is the man, after all, who told a convention of student activists, “I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president. But I don’t even talk about that.” Except, of course, he does.</p> <p>The day after the Senate vote, a decidedly unchastened Trump spoke at a National Prayer Breakfast, brandishing a copy of USA Today whose banner headline contained a single word: “Acquitted.” After disagreeing with the prayerful suggestion offered by Arthur Brooks, former head of the conservative American Enterprise Institute (and a couple of millennia earlier by one Jesus of Nazareth), that we should love our enemies, the president promptly accused both Mitt Romney and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of inadequate prayerfulness. He lumped Romney in with people “who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong” and accused Pelosi, not for the first time, of lying when she says she prays for him.</p> <p>Trump’s endless boasting about his invulnerability can certainly be blamed on the dismal swamp of his own psyche, but there’s another at least partial explanation for it—and it lies in the country’s collective failure to hold anyone responsible for crimes committed since 2001 in the “war on terror.” If one administration can get away with confining detainees in coffin-like boxes and torturing them in myriad other ways, why shouldn’t a later one go unpunished for, to take but one example, putting migrant children in cages?</p> <p>Forward, Not Backwards</p> <p>In 2009, Barack Obama prepared to enter the Oval Office promising to end the worst excesses of the previous administration’s war on terror. Although he did close the CIA’s detention centers and prohibit torture, he also quickly signaled that no one would be held accountable for the already well-documented practice of torture promoted by the administration of George W. Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney. A week or so before Obama’s inauguration, the president-elect was already assuring ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos that, although there would be prosecutions if “somebody has blatantly broken the law,” on the whole he believed “that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards.”</p> <p>In particular, Obama was concerned that government operatives should not be hampered in the future by fear of prosecution for past acts sanctioned by top officials: “And part of my job is to make sure that, for example, at the CIA, you’ve got extraordinarily talented people who are working very hard to keep Americans safe. I don’t want them to suddenly feel like they’ve got to spend all their time looking over their shoulders.”</p> <p>As it turned out, they need not have worried. On April 17, 2009, as Carrie Johnson and Julie Tate reported in The Washington Post, “President Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. reassured CIA employees anew yesterday that interrogators would not face criminal prosecution so long as they followed legal advice.” As Holder put it, “It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the Justice Department.” Current Issue View our current issue</p> <p>The legal advice in question had been contained in a series of infamous memos written by that department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) between 2002 and 2005. In them, the legal definition of torture was “clarified” for a nervous attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, and the CIA. One memo, drafted by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo and signed by Assistant Attorney General for the OLC Jay Bybee, explained that to “constitute torture” under the law, physical pain “must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.” To meet the legal definition of psychological torture, mental suffering “must result in significant psychological harm of significant duration, e.g., lasting for months or even years.”</p> <p>Not surprisingly, despite the previous administration’s stamp of approval on what were euphemistically called “enhanced interrogation techniques,” a three-year investigation by the Obama Justice Department into CIA interrogation practices came to a whimpering end in August 2012, when Holder announced that the only two remaining torture cases, both of which involved deaths in US custody, would be dropped.</p> <p>A year earlier, as Glenn Greenwald reported in The Guardian, Holder had decided not to prosecute anyone in 99 other cases of “severe detainee abuse.” The two remaining cases concerned the death by torture and hypothermia of Gul Rahman in the CIA’s notorious Salt Pit prison in Afghanistan in 2002 and that of “Manadel al-Jamadi, who died in CIA custody after he was beaten, stripped, had cold water poured on him, and then [was] shackled to the wall” at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.</p> <p>Among those Holder presumably chose not to charge were the men responsible for designing and implementing the protocols that led to Rahman’s death, along with tortures like waterboarding and “walling” (the slamming of the back of a prisoner’s head repeatedly into a wall). Thus ended any hope of holding torturers legally accountable in the United States of America, early proof of the kind of impunity that has, in the Trump years, spread elsewhere.</p> <p>Torturer Redux</p> <p>Shortly before Donald Trump’s recent triumph in the Senate, one of those “extraordinarily talented people” hailed by President Obama resurfaced in a courtroom not as a defendant, but as a hostile witness. James Mitchell was called to the stand by the defense at pretrial hearings at the Guantánamo detention facility in Cuba, the offshore prison for detainees in the war on terror set up by the Bush administration in 2002. In the dock almost 18 years later are five men, long held there, who have been accused of involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The most notorious is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, often described as 9/11’s “mastermind.”</p> <p>Mitchell is one of the two psychologists—the other being John “Bruce” Jessen—who designed the CIA’s main torture program. He has the honor of being considered the inventor of waterboarding, a series of techniques aimed at producing water-induced suffering that have formed part of the armamentarium of torturers for centuries. (Perhaps “reinventor” would be the more accurate term.) Mitchell was, in fact, the first person to perform waterboarding in the war on terror, as well as being the architect of walling, of confining victims in tiny boxes, and of a variety of other grim “enhanced interrogation techniques” first employed at CIA “black sites” set up around the world in those years.</p> <p>Called by defense attorneys to describe the torture their clients endured, a “defiant” Mitchell told the courtroom, “I’d get up today and do it again.”</p> <p>As New York Times reporter Carol Rosenberg explained, Mitchell was not actually talking about what he did to any of the five defendants in the dock at Guantánamo, although he did torture some of them. He was referring to the first prisoner to be waterboarded under the CIA torture program, Saudi national Abu Zubaydah, who was waterboarded a total of 83 times over the course of a single month. President George W. Bush’s secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, claimed (falsely, as it turned out) that he was “if not the number two, very close to the number-two person in” Al Qaeda and that he had run an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan.</p> <p>In fact, as the Obama administration acknowledged in 2010, Abu Zubaydah was never even a member of that group, let alone one of its key lieutenants. Captured in a joint CIA-FBI operation in Pakistan in 2002, he would be shuffled between CIA black sites for the next four-and-a-half years, including the Agency’s secret “Strawberry Fields” site at Guantánamo. In part because of what the CIA did to him, Abu Zubaydah remains imprisoned there to this day. According to CIA recommendations, he is never to be “placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mitchell oversaw the 83 times Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded in a single month at a CIA black site in Thailand, during which he came close to death by drowning. On one of those occasions, as the Senate Intelligence Committee’s 2014 report on CIA torture revealed, he was observed to be “completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.”</p> <p>Not unlike our president, Mitchell seems to be deeply hurt by what he perceives as unfair criticism. “You folks have been saying untrue and malicious things about me and Dr. Jessen for years,” he complained to defense attorneys at the Guantánamo hearing. People may have said mean things about him, but in reality, far from being held accountable for torture, James Mitchell has luxuriated in his impunity, earning royalties from his book Enhanced Interrogation: Inside the Minds and Motives of the Islamic Terrorists Trying To Destroy America and giving speeches arranged through the Worldwide Speakers Group (which advertises him as “psychologist, CIA interrogator, author”) at $15,000 to $25,000 a pop.</p> <p>Nor did Mitchell fare poorly while employed by the CIA. In fact, the Agency paid the company Mitchell and Jessen formed $81 million for their work. In addition, their contract included language guaranteeing that the US government would cover any legal costs they incurred as a result of that work through the year 2021. This would turn out to come in handy when, in 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the two of them on behalf of three of their victims: Suleiman Abdullah Salim, Mohamed Ahmed ben Soud, and the family of Gul Rahman, the detainee who had died of exposure to cold at the Salt Pit. Mitchell and Jessen settled the case in 2017 for an undisclosed sum, also paid by the US government.</p> <p>It Never Gets Easier</p> <p>You’d think it would get easier over time. For almost two decades, I’ve been writing about torture. By now, you might imagine that I’d be at least somewhat desensitized to details about and descriptions of it. Instead, each time I dive into that cesspool, it appears even more disgusting and frightening.</p> <p>If it’s hard for me, someone who has never been tortured and has spoken face-to-face with only a few torture survivors, imagine what it must be like for those who have survived the Bush-era torture programs, which went on for an unknown number of years. Actually, you don’t have to do too much imagining, since their testimony about how such abuse affected some of them and how lasting those effects were is available. In 2016, New York Times reporters Matt Apuzzo, Sheri Fink, and James Risen published a series of articles under the title “How U.S. Torture Left a Legacy of Damaged Minds.”</p> <p>One of those profiled was Suleiman Abdullah Salim, a plaintiff in the ACLU suit against Mitchell and Jessen. A Tanzanian native, Salim was picked up in Mogadishu, Somalia, and turned over to US operatives for reasons that remain murky. It’s most likely he was a victim of mistaken identity (and he wouldn’t have been the only such prisoner in the war on terror). We know, at least, that the Americans who bundled him onto a plane were expecting a Yemeni Arab and someone with much lighter skin. He ended up in Afghanistan at a black site he recalls as “the Darkness,” which was, in fact, the Salt Pit. There he was beaten, walled, shackled in complete darkness, exposed to relentless loud music, confined in a coffin-like box, repeatedly hung by the wrists—once for 48 hours straight—and drenched at times with ice water until he feared he was drowning.</p> <p>Eventually, the CIA moved Salim to a prison at Bagram Airbase outside the Afghan capital, Kabul. In 2008, he was turned loose in Afghanistan with only the clothes he was wearing. The International Red Cross arranged a flight home to Zanzibar, Tanzania, where he still lives, haunted by the Darkness.</p> <p>In 2010, the Times’ Risen wrote, “Dr. Sondra Crosby of the Boston University School of Medicine, a physician, a Navy reservist and an expert on torture, was asked by Physicians for Human Rights, a New York–based group, to evaluate Mr. Salim.” She found that he was emaciated “like a skeleton” and “plagued by profound distress, inability to eat, and inability to sleep.” Risen’s report continues:</p> <p>“He describes himself as a ghost walking around the town,” she added. She noted other symptoms: flashbacks, short- and long-term memory loss, distress at seeing anyone in a military uniform, hopelessness about the future and a strong avoidance of noise. “He reports that his head feels empty—like an empty box,’ she said.”</p> <p>The Times series also chronicled the suffering of another plaintiff in the case against Mitchell and Jessen: Mohamed ben Soud. He, too, was held at the Salt Pit, where his ordeal involved many of the same torture methods Salim had endured. Today, he has full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder. “He is racked with self-doubt and struggles to make simple decisions. His moods swing dramatically,” reported the Times.</p> <p>First, Do No Harm?</p> <p>The pretrial hearings at Guantánamo have also revealed the rarely discussed role of doctors and other medical workers in the US torture program. Apparently the reason we know that Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed 183 times is that, as James Mitchell testified in January, a doctor was indeed present inside the torture chamber and used a little metal click-counter to keep track. According to the Times’ Rosenberg, however, doctors “did more than count waterboarding sessions. Government investigations and evidence in the pretrial hearings of the men…show doctors conducted ‘rectal rehydration,’ carried out rectal cavity searches, and examined swollen feet and legs of captives who were sleep deprived for days by being shackled in painful positions.”</p> <p>There is undoubtedly more to be uncovered about the role of medical personnel at the CIA’s global black sites. Indeed, there is more to be uncovered about all the ways in which detainees were stripped not only of their human rights but, at least in the minds of their tormentors, of their very humanity. At one point in his testimony, for instance, Mitchell turned to the attorney for Ammar al-Baluchi, one of the five 9/11 defendants. Speaking of Charlie Wise, the CIA interrogation chief and the rest of his crew, Mitchell said, “Looks like they used your client as a training prop.” According to The Guardian’s Julian Borger, in fact, under Wise’s leadership, “trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification.”</p> <p>And Mitchell himself used Abu Zubaydah as a demonstration prop, so bigwigs at the CIA would be implicated in what he was doing. Borger reports that “he waterboarded Abu Zubaydah even though he was quite sure the detainee had no actionable intelligence to surrender. It was done purely as a demonstration for the agency VIPs.”</p> <p>The Price of Impunity</p> <p>Thanks to the cowardice of the Obama administration, no CIA officer or any higher official in the administration of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, no psychologist, no doctor, no one at all has yet been held accountable for the years of torture practiced on a global scale in the war on terror. Donald Trump himself, of course, got elected while publicly proclaiming about waterboarding that “I like it a lot,” and he reportedly considered Gina Haspel’s black-site torture experiences a positive part of her résumé when considering her for CIA director. Mitchell, of course, continues to make speeches and collect his royalties. George W. Bush has been rehabilitated as a kindly portrait painter.</p> <p>Is it really so surprising, then, that we now have a man in the Oval Office who believes he has “the right to do whatever I want as president”? The history of the 21st century war on terror suggests that, if he doesn’t have the right, he certainly appears to have the power.</p>",3

920724988,Chinese Lawyer Completes 4-Year Prison Sentence,2020-04-28 00:00:00,"<p>Human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang was finally allowed to see his family in Beijing on Monday, three weeks after he was nominally released from a 4.5-year prison sentence.</p> <p>Wang was thrown into a dubious “coronavirus quarantine” after his jail term ended, then forbidden to travel to Beijing. He told reporters on Monday he might not be allowed to stay with his family for long, even though his wife is gravely ill.</p> <p>Wang was arrested without due process during a vicious persecution of human rights lawyers and democracy activists known as the 709 Crackdown, because it began on July 9, 2015. At least 300 people were detained and interrogated during the crackdown, mostly using the CCP’s reliable excuse for persecuting dissidents, “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.”</p> <p>Lawyers brave enough to attempt representing victims of the 709 Crackdown were harassed and intimidated, as were the families of the victims. Sham trials and illegal detentions without charge were hidden from outside observers by claiming sensitive “state secrets” were revealed during testimony.</p> <p>Wang languished in prison for over three years, without access to legal representation or contact with his family, before the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) got around to charging him with anything. He was convicted of “subverting state power” in January 2019, probably because he offered legal representation to members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, and “sentenced to four years and six months in prison, and deprived of political rights for five years,” according to the court statement. He was finally allowed to see his family in prison for the first time in June 2019, four years after the CCP made him disappear.</p> <p>Amnesty International declared Wang a “prisoner of conscience” who was “at risk of torture and other ill-treatment,” unsuccessfully demanding his immediate release. Human Rights Watch noted that Wang’s detention and the constant official harassment of his family violated both Chinese and international law.</p> <p>Persistent reports circulated that Wang was tortured with electric shocks during his detention. He told reporters on Monday he is not yet comfortable with discussing how he is treated, which is unsurprising given that he remains under constant surveillance and could be whisked away from his wife and son again at any moment.</p> <p>After Wang was released from prison, he was immediately “quarantined” for possible coronavirus exposure, effectively putting him under house arrest in his hometown of Jinan for weeks while his family waited in Beijing. When the “quarantine” was finally lifted, he was told he was not allowed to travel to Beijing. His movements remained restricted to short shopping trips around Jinan, and friends said they feared they would be “quarantined” as well if they went to visit him.</p> <p>The U.S. State Department denounced the continuing persecution of Wang Quanzhang last week and demanded he be allowed to rejoin his family in Beijing. When Wang learned his wife Li Wenzu was suffering from severe abdominal pain, he defied the police and tried to take a taxi to Beijing. He was seized by masked plainclothes police officers when his taxi reached the highway and detained for a while, but eventually allowed to complete his journey to Beijing.</p> <p>Radio Free Asia (RFA) described the emotional reunion between Wang, Li, and their seven-year-old son:</p> <p>“I don’t know how many times I’ve dreamed of us being reunited during the past five years,” his wife Li Wenzu said as the couple hugged. “Now it feels as if I’m dreaming.” “Dad, we’re having dumplings this evening,” the couple’s young son Wang Guangwei told his father in a video made available by the family via social media. “Great, can I have a hug now?” Wang replied, before sitting with his arms around his wife and child on the family sofa.</p> <p>In a videotaped recording of the family union, Wang said he felt as though he has awakened from a trance and said it took him five years to realize his dream of once more holding his wife and child. “We’ll never be apart again, will we?” Li asked him.</p> <p>Li has been hospitalized for her abdominal pain and may soon require surgery for appendicitis, according to a friend of the family, who added she has “been under constant psychological pressure for the past five years.” Li herself said she has received treatment, but is still in some pain.</p> <p>Li captured international attention in April 2018 by shaving her head and marching over 60 miles from Beijing to Tianjin, the city where her husband was incarcerated, to raise awareness of his plight and demand answers from the authorities. At the time, she was not certain if Wang was still alive, fearing he might have been tortured to death in a bid to extract a forced confession.</p> <p>“We are walking to seek an answer from the Chinese legal system. Is China really a country with rule of law?” she asked as she began her march.</p> <p>Before he defied the CCP’s orders and returned to Beijing, Wang told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that he was forced to set aside his emotional connection to his family to survive in prison.</p> <p>“I was suddenly isolated from the whole world and I was totally consumed by the pain that I was separated from my wife and son. As it went on, I had no choice but to force myself to give up my emotional reliance on them and become indifferent,” he explained.</p> <p>“Honestly, I would not be able to stand my ground for so long if I had not become indifferent. So this was why I was very aloof to my family when they visited me at the prison,” he added.</p> <p>Wang said his goal was to “gradually find my way back to the psychological and emotional state of a normal person.”</p> <p>The Hong Kong Free Press noticed a crowd of “around ten” police and other government officials swarming around Wang and Li’s apartment as “minders.” Three of them tried to follow Wang into the apartment but were rebuffed by Li and her friend Wang Qialoing, wife of another human rights lawyer who was a political prisoner in China, Li Heping.</p>",3

He said the government believed in solving problems through dialogue.</p> <p>However, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid said no talks with the TLP were under way. He said the operation would be resumed if the situation did not improve.</p> <p>Throughout the day, authorities maintained a complete ban on the broadcast of any news about the clash, including the attack on the police station, abduction of police officials and death and injuries caused during the clashes. It was only late in the evening that government officials appeared on private TV channels to state that the trouble started when TLP protesters went berserk and attacked a police station during which a DSP and a number of policemen were taken hostage.</p> <p>In a video message, TLP spokesperson Shafiq Ameeni said police and other security forces had attacked their Lahore headquarters at around 8am. “Several workers were killed while a number of others were injured,” he said.</p> <p>He said the policemen taken hostage by them had attacked the TLP headquarters and were involved in the killing of its workers.</p> <p>He said the policemen were rescued from the mob and given first aid. “They are still in our custody and will be released when the situation improves.”</p> <p>Mr Ameeni said freeing them right now was risky as the mob outside the TLP headquarters might attack them.</p> <p>He claimed that police had arrested their workers from different hospitals, but he could not give the exact number of the dead and the injured.</p> <p>The TLP also shared a video of DSP Umar Farooq Baloch in its custody. The video shows him saying an operation was carried out to clear the area outside the police station when he was captured by the enraged crowd.</p> <p>Appealing for a way forward through dialogue, the DSP said three people were killed and several others suffered bullet wounds.</p> <p>The TLP protesters also took over two stations of the Lahore Orange Line train service, already suspended these days due to coronavirus-related restrictions.</p> <p>The stations are Bund Road (Yateem Khana intersection) and Salahuddin stations — both situated on Multan Road — the area where the TLP head office is located.</p> <p>“Both Orange Line elevated stations have been taken over by the protesters who are sitting on the floor and other spaces of the stations. There are reports of breaking of a couple of CCTV cameras either by them or someone else,” a senior official of the Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMTA) told Dawn. “We don’t know about other damage so far.”</p> <p>The PMTA put its security staff on high alert at all 26 stations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some TV channels aired a hand-written statement of TLP chief Allama Saad Hussain Rizvi, directing the organisation’s Majlis-i-Shura to cancel the protest call for April 20. He also directed his followers to end the sit-in outside at Yateem Khana Chowk and disperse peacefully.</p> <p>Protest in Karachi</p> <p>Supporters of the TLP resumed protest in an area of Karachi on Sunday night, but police used force to disperse them.</p> <p>A police officer said TLP workers took to the streets and tried to block railway tracks in Machar Colony but police used tear gas to disperse them.</p> <p>Karachi police chief, Additional IG Ghulam Nabi Memon, said that as part of the countrywide security measures, red alert has been issued for Karachi also.</p> <p>Khalid Husnain in Lahore and Imtiaz Ali in Karachi also contributed to this report</p> <p>Published in Dawn, April 19th, 2021</p>",3
1039869007,Less pressure,2022-04-18 07:30:51,"<p>THE Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors in January released a report detailing how media freedom in Pakistan had progressively declined under PTI rule. At the time, Shehbaz Sharif took notice of the report, commenting that Pakistan would lose its GSP-Plus trading status with the EU and deter other foreign investment if it did not improve the environment for the press.</p> <p>This is hardly the resounding, principled defence of media freedom that one would want from political leaders who are fashioning themselves as the saviours of Pakistani democracy. But it is the type of practical assessment that may spur meaningful action from a politician known for pragmatism and outcomes. And after the three-and-a-half-year battering that the press has endured during Imran Khan’s tenure, any steps towards improved media freedom — irrespective of what motivates them — should be welcomed. But is the younger Sharif ready to take them?</p> <p>The clampdown on media is among the darkest aspects of Khan’s legacy. Pakistan slipped by six points to 145th position in the World Press Freedom Index 2021. During Khan’s tenure, the media was stripped of freedom and funding. Journalists were harassed, abducted and tortured. News outlets were denied advertising revenue or blocked outright. The PTI government also worked hard (though mercifully failed) to centralise media control through a proposed Pakistan Media Development Authority, which would have had the power to shut down any news outlet, without offering any notice or justification, or being subject to legal challenge.</p> <p>The most absurd demonstration of the PTI government’s disdain for the press was the passage of the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021, long sought as a way to offer some recourse for journalists under threat. Section 6 of that bill undermined the legislation entirely, as it prohibited media workers from spreading “false information”, advocating hatred or inciting violence. The vague wording of the section was widely perceived as an attempt by the government to muzzle journalists, empowering the state to label all critical reporting as fake news.</p> <p>Will the new set-up defend press freedom?</p> <p>The recent political turbulence has eased pressure on the press. As institutions have been embroiled in power tussles, journalists have noted a slowdown in directives, less harassment, and increased opportunities for critical reporting. How long will this last? What can one expect from a PML-N-led coalition, given the party’s own sordid history with the press, from Najam Sethi’s 1999 arrest on trumped-up treason charges to the passage in 2015 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, which enabled a crackdown on online free speech?</p> <p>Restoring a modicum of press freedom should be a no-brainer for the coalition government. This should include an easing off on news outlets as well as concrete acts such as the removal of Section 6 from the journalists’ protection legislation and increasing government advertising budgets for news outlets. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has already demanded as much from Sharif.</p> <p>Such steps would quickly demonstrate that the Sharif-led coalition government is truly committed to the democratic values it championed during the no-confidence vote, and that it intends to approach governance in a radically different way from Khan. It would also change the growing public perception that all our political leaders are merely puppets, caught in an endless game of musical chairs, and give hope that genuine democratic progress is possible.</p> <p>The coalition parties under Sharif have a choice to make. They can either sink to Khan’s level and play his dangerous games, or they can learn from their experience as an embattled opposition — as well as from the resilience of our Constitution as demonstrated by recent events — and do things differently, better. This choice will apply across all areas of governance, but also in how they approach the media.</p> <p>The recent arrests by the FIA of PTI social media activists on charges of smearing the army and judiciary and the suspension of thousands of PTI-linked social media accounts are tactics from PTI’s censorship and intimidation book. As the battle of narratives between Khan and the military over Cable­gate escalates, we’re likely to see the establishment resort to various means to prevent the armed forces from being publicly mali­gned. This may include pressure on the media to promote one narrative over the other, including through undemocratic means such as media blackouts of PTI rallies.</p> <p>The new government must work hard to prevent this. Such a crackdown will further rile PTI ranks, and give their conspiracies and victimhood narratives more power. It will also confirm to those who had serious reservations about Khan’s ruling tactics that the alternatives are not much better. For the sake of foreign investment, if nothing else, let’s hope Sharif defends Pakistan’s beleaguered press.</p> <p>The writer is a political and integrity risk analyst.</p> <p>Twitter: @humayusuf</p> <p>Published in Dawn, April 18th, 2022</p>",3

(Photo by: Juan Carlo de Vela / MANILA BULLETIN)</p> <p>PNP spokesman Brig. Gen. Ildebrandi Usana said the reports of accusing the police and the military of arresting the lumad are meant to discredit the government in its efforts to stop the recruitment of the communist rebels.</p> <p>“The report was slanted and malicious,” said Usana.</p> <p>He said that the rescue operation was a big blow to what he described as a deceptive and devious handiwork of the communist rebels in recruiting minors as future armed combatants.</p> <p>Based on the PNP report, the operation stemmed from the complaints of the tribal leaders and parents of the minors—seven boys and 14 girls— about the missing minors since 2018.</p> <p>The lumads were reportedly recruited in Talaingod town of Davao del Norte and were taken to the USC retreat house in Cebu City for alleged indoctrination.</p> <p>“According to these parents, their children were taken by the members of the Salugpungan Ta Tanu Igkanogon without their knowledge and consent. The children have been separated from their parents since 2018.

Gen. Ronnie Montejo, director of the Central Visayas regional police.</p> <p>“They also asked for donations using the IP minors. The Salugpungan was an alternative learning institution run by the Communist Terrorist Group. Salugpungan schools were closed by the government since they operated without proper permit, aside from being used as a breeding ground for the communist recruitment of minors,” he added.</p> <p>During the conduct of the operation on Monday morning, PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said those who were arrested were six people whom he tagged as involved in indoctrinating the lumad minors.</p> <p>The rescue operation is a manifestation that the reds have been continuously engaged in recruiting and exploiting minors to be trained as child warriors which is a clear violation of International Humanitarian Law and child protection laws” said Sinas, for his part.</p> <p>Sinas said charges of Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention Case in relation to Republic Act. 7610, Violation of R.A. 9208 otherwise known as “Anti-Human Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003”, as amended by R.A. 10364.</p> <p>“The fact that the victims are minors in this case, and they had been subjected of various types of exploitation, a violation of the Anti-Child Abuse Law may also be filed against the suspects,” said Montejo, for his part.</p> <p>“Additionally, we are also in the process of consolidating all reliable information and evidence that shall be used for other appropriate cases to be filed against the suspects and other persons who are involved in these criminal activities,” he added.</p>",3

970184434,Gunmen kidnap dozens from school in central Nigeria,2021-02-17 14:43:02,"<p>Gunmen from a suspected criminal gang stormed a school in central Nigeria on Wednesday, killing one student and kidnapping dozens of other pupils, teachers and relatives, the local government said, in the country’s latest mass abduction.</p> <p>President Muhammadu Buhari ordered security forces to coordinate a rescue operation, his office said, after gunmen in military uniforms raided the Government Science College in the town of Kagara in Niger state.</p> <p>Details about the kidnapping were still emerging and a new tally came after initial reports from a government official and a security source that hundreds of students were snatched from the school, where they were staying in dormitories.</p> <p>“They kidnapped 42 people from the school. They took away 27 students, along with three teachers. One student was killed. They also kidnapped 12 family members of the teachers,” Muhammad Sani Idris, spokesman for Niger state’s government, told AFP by phone.</p> <p>He said 650 students had been in the school when it was attacked at 2:00 am (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.</p> <p>Heavily-armed gangs known locally as “bandits” in northwest and central Nigeria have stepped up attacks in recent years, kidnapping for ransom, raping and pillaging.</p> <p>Buhari condemned the abduction and ordered security forces to coordinate an operation to rescue the students.</p> <p>“The president has directed the armed forces and police to ensure immediate and safe return of all the captives,” spokesman Garba Shehu said in a statement without giving details on the number of missing.</p> <p>Only two months ago, more than 300 students were kidnapped from a school in Kankara in nearby Katsina, Buhari’s home state, while the president was visiting the region.</p> <p>The boys were later released after negotiations with government officials, but the incident sparked global outrage.</p> <p>“Attacks on schools and abductions of children are war crimes,” Amnesty International reacted in a statement on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Those found to be responsible of the abduction must be brought to justice,” said the rights group’s director in Nigeria, Osai Ojigho.</p> <p>The UN children’s agency UNICEF also condemned the attack and called for the students’ release.</p> <p>“Children should feel safe at home and at school at all times — and parents should not need to worry for the safety of their children when they send them off to school in the morning,” UNICEF’s Nigeria representative Peter Hawkins said.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello ordered boarding schools in four areas to shut down until further notice.</p> <p>“Government at all levels should also ensure that our schools are henceforth protected against heartless criminals who have apparently identified them as soft targets,” Nigeria’s Senate President Ahmad Lawan said.</p> <p>– Tracking bandits –</p> <p>Kidnap gangs in Nigeria’s northwest and central states are just one challenge in Africa’s most populous country, where security forces face ethnic clashes, jihadists in the northeast and piracy in the south.</p> <p>The government official said earlier that some students escaped and a security source said a headcount had been underway to confirm how many were abducted.</p> <p>Troops with air support were tracking the bandits for a possible rescue operation, the source said.</p> <p>A statement from the Senate said “security agencies were able to detect the coordinates of the area the students were taken to”.</p> <p>The region is increasingly a hub for criminal gangs who raid villages, killing and abducting residents after looting and torching homes.</p> <p>Bandits are known to hide in camps in Rugu forest, which straddles Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states. Despite the deployment of troops, deadly attacks persist.</p> <p>The gangs are largely driven by financial motives and have no known ideological leanings.</p> <p>But there is growing concern they are being infiltrated by jihadists from the northeast who are waging a decade-old insurgency to establish an Islamic state.</p> <p>The latest kidnapping incident comes three years after 111 schoolgirls were snatched by jihadists in Dapchi and nearly seven years after 276 girls were taken from Chibok in a raid that shocked the world.</p> <p>“Nigeria has to declare a state of emergency on insecurity,” said Idayat Hassan, director of the Abuja-based Centre for Democracy and Development think tank.</p> <p>“The government must secure the schools and urgently too, or else (the) Chibok, Dapchi and Kankara school raids will encourage others to do worse.”</p>",3
1000144791,"Mother, Baby Die After Haiti Gang Kidnaps Doctor",2021-08-20 18:14:58-05:00,"<p>(Newser) – After being hit with a devastating earthquake and then a tropical storm, Haiti clearly did not need this latest problem: Gangs kidnapping doctors. One physician rushing to deliver a baby via emergency C-section was kidnapped in the capital of Haiti Tuesday, and the woman and her baby died. Another doctor, an orthopedic surgeon treating earthquake victims, was kidnapped a day later. On Thursday, a network of eight private hospitals declared a two-day shutdown, except for emergency patients, to protest the unchecked gang activity. “Kidnapping is one thing. But the fact that the mother and child died is unacceptable,” Ronald Laroche, founder of the Port-au-Prince hospitals, told the Miami Herald. Kidnappers have contacted both families, but there were no details on ransom demands.</p> <p>Ariel Henry, Haiti’s prime minister, said that though the rival gangs apparently responsible for the kidnappings were supposed to have a truce to help earthquake relief get through, police presence was going to be ramped up to protect doctors and aid workers. Police are focusing on the Martissant region, which has a reputation for being rough, per the AP. But the woman and child died in Petionville, a quieter, wealthier part of Port-au-Prince. Aid distribution has been slow—and tense. Police fired warning shots over young men packed into a crowd against the fence around a small airport in Les Cayes, Al Jazeera reports. Residents of villages along routes to harder hit areas are building barricades to stop aid packages from passing them by, too. (Read more Haiti earthquake stories.)</p>",3
1007329265,Kidnappers who once terrorised Lagos schools behind AVM Smith’s abduction– Police sources,2021-10-03 03:41:18,"<p>There are indications that kidnappers who terrorised schools in Epe and Ikorodu areas about five years ago have resumed their criminal escapades in the riverine areas of the state as police sources linked the abduction of a retired Air Vice Marshal, Sikiru Smith, to the gang.</p> <p>The sources on Saturday confided in our correspondent that the abductors lurked around the creeks in Ikorodu and Ajah axis before they eventually released Smith early Saturday. They also said an undisclosed amount was paid as ransom.</p> <p>Smith, the Chairman of Double Wealth Ventures Limited – a dredging and engineering firm – was supervising work on a site in Ajah on Monday when masked gunmen invaded the place and shot into the air to scare people away.</p> <p>The gunmen were said to have whisked him away in a waiting speedboat and headed towards Ikorodu.</p> <p>A team drawn from different tactical squads and coordinated by the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, was set up to rescue the retired AVM, who is a cousin to a former Inspector-General of Police and current Chairman of the Police Service Commission, Musiliu Smith.</p> <p>A source privy to the rescue operation confided in our correspondent that the former Air Force boss was freed at a spot in Ajah in the early hours of Saturday.</p> <p>The source said, “They (the kidnappers) had been taking him between Ajah and Ikorodu all this while. The police were monitoring their movement but were being careful not to take any action that will put the man’s life at risk. He was eventually released around Ajah.</p> <p>“A ransom was paid but I didn’t know the amount. In any case police were not party to ransom payment. The kidnappers are known; they were the ones who kidnapped children in schools in Ikorodu and Epe some five years ago before the issue was addressed. The police will go after them.”</p> <p>Another reliable source at the state police command told Sunday PUNCH that Smith’s abduction was a resurgence by a kidnap gang that once carried out abductions in the Lagos schools. The officer, however, said a manhunt had been launched for the gang.</p> <p>“The police combed the Ikorodu area based on intelligence. We know those behind the kidnap and we are going after them. It is the same set of criminals who invaded secondary schools in Ikorodu and Epe some years back. The retired Air Vice Mashal was eventually released early today (Saturday) around Ajah,” the source explained.</p> <p>Efforts to get the freed AVM proved abortive as calls to his line on Saturday were not reachable.</p> <p>Lagos State was under the grip of kidnappings, including abduction of schoolchildren, between 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>One of the prominent incidents was the May 2017 invasion of Lagos State Model College, Igbonla, Epe, by gunmen, who seized six pupils and took them away in a boat. The victims spent 64 days in captivity before they were released after ransom payment.</p> <p>In June 2017, suspected kidnappers wrote Lagos State Model College, Kankon, Badagry, threatening to abduct some pupils and staff members of the school “the same way we did at Igbonla, Epe.” The attack was however averted.</p> <p>Earlier, in March 2016, three schoolgirls at Babington Macaulay Junior Seminary School, Ikorodu, were abducted by gunmen. They were rescued about five days later and some suspects arrested.</p> <p>The Police Public Relations Officer in the State, CSP Adekunle Ajisebutu, confirmed Smith’s release but said he had yet to get full details.</p> <p>The PPRO had yet to reply to our correspondent’s enquiry on steps being taken by the command to tackle resurgence of kidnapping in the state.</p> <p>However, Odumosu, the state Commissioner of Police, had in a statement on Wednesday issued by Ajisebutu, urged the residents not to panic, assuring them of safety of lives and property.</p> <p>The statement read in part, “The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu wishes to assure residents that Lagos State is safe, and that they should not panic on account of the viral post or the recent security infringement in Ajah where AVM Sikiru Smith (retd.) was abducted. While still pleading with members of the public to believe in police’s ability to protect them at all times, the Commissioner of Police once again solicits the support of the public, sister agencies and other strategic partners by giving prompt but actionable intelligence that would further decimate criminal elements and their nefarious activities in the state.”</p> <p>Copyright PUNCH.</p> <p>All rights reserved.

986746226,Belarus is isolated as other countries move to ban flights,2021-05-25 00:00:00,"<p>For many passengers, it initially seemed like one of those unexpected delays in airline travel. But after the pilot announced the plane had been diverted to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, one passenger — Roman Protasevich, a prominent Belarusian opposition journalist who had been living in exile since 2019 — grew terrified, certain that he faced arrest.</p> <p>“He panicked because we were about to land in Minsk,” Marius Rutkauskas, who was sitting one row ahead of Protasevich, told the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT upon arrival in Vilnius.</p> <p>Sunday’s ordeal — described by many European officials as an extraordinary, state-sponsored hijacking by Belarus to seize Protasevich — quickly led to one of the most severe East-West flare-ups in recent years.</p> <p>Meeting Monday evening in Brussels, European Union leaders called on all EU-based airlines to stop flying over Belarus and began the process of banning Belarusian airlines from flying over the bloc’s airspace or landing in its airports — effectively severing the country’s direct air connections to Western Europe.</p> <p>The measures represented a harsh Western broadside against Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’ authoritarian president, who is already under EU sanctions for rights violations over his brutal repression of protests last year. There was no indication, however, that the intensified squeeze would alter Lukashenko’s resolve — especially with President Vladimir Putin of Russia steadfast in his support.</p> <p>On the contrary, Lukashenko on Monday tightened restrictions on dissent even further, signing new laws that banned things like online livestreams from unauthorised protests.</p> <p>“Lukashenko does not see it necessary to bow to the West’s demands — he has Russia, which he relies on,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Minsk-based nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “He has not been cornered.”</p> <p>The moves came as new details trickled out suggesting that the landing of the Ryanair Boeing 737-800 in Minsk on Sunday was an elaborately staged operation, with a bomb hoax and a fighter jet scrambled by Lukashenko to escort the airliner. The Lithuanian police said that of the 126 passengers who took off from Athens, five stayed behind in Minsk — Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who were both detained, plus three unidentified individuals.</p> <p>One Lithuanian official said the three included two Belarusian citizens and one Greek. But uncertainty about their identities raised questions over whether they had any role in the operation.</p> <p>“We believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well,” Michael O’Leary, the CEO of Ireland-based Ryanair, told Irish radio Monday. “This was a case of state-sponsored hijacking.”</p> <p>Belarusian state television broadcast a report rejecting the idea there were KGB agents on the plane, instead showing three people who said on camera that they had decided to stay in Minsk by their own choosing. They included a Greek man who said he had been traveling to Vilnius on his way to visit his wife in Minsk.</p> <p>In Lithuania, the police launched an investigation on suspicion of hijacking and kidnapping, and interviewed passengers and crew. They were told that the fighter jet dispatched by Lukashenko to escort the flight had not forced the Ryanair plane to land, according to people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorised to speak publicly.</p> <p>Instead, these people said, the pilot had decided to land the plane in Minsk after Belarusian air traffic control had requested that he do so because of a bomb threat on board.</p> <p>“The decision was made by the captain of the liner after consulting with Ryanair management,” Rolandas Kiskis, head of the Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau, told reporters in Vilnius.</p> <p>But no bomb was discovered, contributing to accusations that it was all a ruse to get the plane to land.</p> <p>The arrested journalist, Protasevich, who co-founded an account on the social media app Telegram that helped galvanise and coordinate the mass protests against Lukashenko last year, had been placed on a list of terrorists by the KGB, Belarus’ intelligence service, still known by its Soviet-era initials.</p> <p>A pro-Lukashenko Telegram account posted a 29-second video of Protasevich late Monday evening. It showed him sitting with arms folded at a wooden desk, telling the camera that he is in Minsk’s central Detention Center No. 1 and is being treated “with maximum correctness.” It was reminiscent of other confessional videos that critics of Lukashenko have been forced to record while in jail.</p> <p>“I continue to cooperate with the investigation and am giving confessional testimony on charges of organising mass unrest in the city of Minsk,” Protasevich said.</p> <p>The video was the latest sign that Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, did not intend to shirk from confrontation with the West. An official in the Belarus Transportation Ministry, Artyom Sikorsky, on Monday doubled down on Minsk’s official version of events: that the plane had been diverted because of a bomb threat. He read out an email that he said had been sent to the Minsk airport from someone who claimed to be representing Hamas — the Palestinian militant group — threatening to punish the European Union for supporting Israel in the recent war. (Hamas denied any connection to the incident, Reuters reported.)</p> <p>By the end of the day, Lukashenko had plunged headfirst into yet another diplomatic showdown. He expelled the ambassador and the entire diplomatic staff of neighbouring Latvia from Minsk in response to the mayor of Riga, Latvia, hoisting the white-red-white flag of the Belarusian opposition.</p> <p>A prime reason for Lukashenko’s apparent confidence was seen in Moscow, where Russian officials and pro-Kremlin commentators lined up to voice their support.</p> <p>“We consider this issue to be a domestic affair of Belarus,” Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson, said, according to Interfax. “The actions of the Belarusian aviation authorities were in line with international standards.”</p> <p>The International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, has said the Belarus action may have violated a long-standing treaty that has governed commercial airlines for decades. The organisation called an urgent meeting for Thursday to discuss it.</p> <p>In recent years, Lukashenko had profited by playing the interests of Russia and the West off against one another. But amid last summer’s popular uprising against him over his disputed reelection, Lukashenko threw in his lot with Putin — and has relied on his support ever since.</p> <p>Last year, the European Union sanctioned Belarus officials — including Lukashenko — over human rights abuses, to little apparent effect. The flight bans could have a greater impact, at least on regular people; the summer 2021 timetable of Belavia, Belarus’ national carrier, includes flights to 20 EU cities.</p> <p>And some analysts said the restrictions could require costly rerouting for European airlines, which are already avoiding parts of Ukraine, Belarus’ southern neighbour, because of conflict with Russia.</p> <p>The flight bans could cause new problems for Lukashenko inside his country, where the ease of travel to the neighbouring European Union had long softened the strictures of living inside an authoritarian state. Ukraine, which is not a member of the EU, also said it would ban flights to and from Belarus. The growing isolation means that Belarusians will increasingly need to travel east to Russia in order to get out of the country.</p> <p>Yevgeny Lipkovich, a popular Minsk-based blogger and commentator critical of Lukashenko, said that his own travels abroad had allowed him to “remain an optimist, despite the regime’s best efforts to force me into depression.”</p> <p>“If they close down the air loophole, there’s no question that the pressure inside the country will increase,” Lipkovich said. “And it’s disgusting to live in a pariah state.”</p> <p> 2021 The New York Times Company</p>",3
1023752829,"More Trouble for the FBI in the Whitmer Kidnapping Case In a stunning move, defense lawyers now want prosecutors to offer immunity not to their clients but to FBI agents and informants. By Julie Kelly",2022-01-18 00:00:00,"<p>The media went wild last week after Joe Biden’s Justice Department finally produced a criminal indictment to support the claim that January 6 was an “insurrection” planned by militiamen loyal to Donald Trump: Eleven members of the Oath Keepers, including its founder, Stewart Rhodes, face the rarely used charge of seditious conspiracy for their brief and nonviolent involvement at the Capitol protest that day.</p> <p>Journalists luxuriated in the news, jeering those of us who had correctly noted that the Justice Department had failed to charge anyone with insurrection or sedition for more than a year.</p> <p>But the press does not share the same zeal in covering another politically charged investigation: the imploding criminal case against five men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. The kidnapping narrative shares many similarities with their preferred telling of January 6, not the least of which is that alleged militias incited by Trump attempted to carry out a domestic terror attack.</p> <p>Despite wall-to-wall coverage after the charges in the Michigan case were announced right before Election Day, the corporate media has almost completely memory-holed the abduction caper. Stewart Rhodes is a household name; Stephen Robeson, a convicted felon and the chief FBI informant in the Whitmer case accused of all sorts of malfeasance, is not.</p> <p>The reason, of course, is that exposing how the FBI set a trap to lure down-on-their-luck men—one of the codefendants referred to Adam Fox, the alleged plot leader, as “Captain Autism”—into their kidnapping ruse would run afoul of the media’s insistence that the government had nothing to do with the events of January 6, despite plenty of proof that hundreds of FBI agents and informants were involved before and during the Capitol protest. (A top FBI official recently refused under oath to say whether FBI agents or assets engaged in or incited violent criminal behavior on January 6.)</p> <p>Perhaps the media considers it a mere coincidence that the head of the FBI Detroit field office overseeing the Whitmer plot was promoted to head of the FBI Washington, D.C. field office several weeks before January 6?</p> <p>Defense attorneys in the Whitmer case are making a strong case for FBI entrapment, detailing egregious misconduct by the agency, and asking a judge to dismiss the charges. At least a dozen FBI agents and confidential human sources orchestrated the kidnapping scheme; defense attorneys claim the feds “actively planned and coordinated its efforts to induce the defendants to engage in incriminating behavior and statements, even going so far as designing the objective and structural components of the [kidnapping] conspiracy.”</p> <p>In a stunning move, defense lawyers now want prosecutors to offer immunity not to their clients but to FBI agents and informants. A new defense filing took the rare step of asking the judge to order the Justice Department to offer “use immunity” to every FBI asset involved in the plot. Fearing they will invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in court, defense attorneys are attempting to compel testimony that would be immune from prosecution, except charges of perjury.</p> <p>John Kiyonaga, a D.C. criminal defense attorney representing a few January 6 defendants, told me over the weekend that the request is “mind blowingly rare.”</p> <p>Prosecutors are desperate to conceal the FBI’s animating, and likely criminal, role in the Whitmer plot. The Justice Department notified the court in December that three of the top FBI agents on the case—including Richard Trask, the FBI investigator who signed the criminal complaint against the federal defendants in October 2020—have been removed from the government’s witness list. (The trial is set for March 8.)</p> <p>Trask, in fact, was fired by the FBI—a near-impossible feat—after he was arrested for assaulting his wife in a drunken rage following a swingers party last summer. Reporters also discovered several anti-Trump tirades posted on Trask’s social media accounts.</p> <p>“The investigation in this case was based primarily on the efforts of FBI agents and confidential human sources,” wrote Scott Graham, the attorney representing Kaleb Frank, one of five men facing conspiracy to kidnap charges, punishable by a life sentence. “Normally, these people would testify at trial and would answer relevant questions posed by both sides to the case. The entrapment defense directed at both groups would be argued by the parties and decided by the jury. This case, however, is different from most. It is now apparent that a number of both the agents and sources have reason to refuse to testify by invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.”</p> <p>Prosecutors also don’t plan to call on Stephen Robeson, the informant who coordinated every surveillance and training trip related to the caper. Not only has Robeson been charged with committing at least two crimes while working the Whitmer plot, the Justice Department accuses him (implausibly) of acting as a “double agent.”</p> <p>Defense attorneys aren’t buying the government’s latest excuse to keep Robeson, a longtime FBI source, off the witness stand. Robeson’s testimony, the defense argues, “will establish repeated violations of FBI policies in handling [informants], making it both exculpatory and essential.”</p> <p>The defense also wants to show the jury at least 258 examples of recordings and communications between the informants and their FBI handlers to show how the agency directed every aspect of the attempted kidnapping. Prosecutors claim the statements are “hearsay” and don’t want jurors to see them.</p> <p>So, what would their unvarnished testimony and captured communications likely reveal? That without the elaborate involvement of the FBI, which compensated the lead informant at least $50,000 for six months’ work and funded every outing to produce photographic evidence of the defendants’ participation in weapons training camps and reconnaissance missions, the plot never would have made it past idle chatter.</p> <p>It likely would show how the FBI infiltrated alleged “militia groups” and even lured people into those groups beginning in early 2020 under the guise of monitoring potentially violent anti-lockdown rallies.</p> <p>Evidence would expose how a lockdown rally at the Michigan Capitol building in April 2020 acted as a dress rehearsal for January 6, and how the FBI steered the defendants from more lockdown protests to the kidnapping plot.</p> <p>The jury also would hear how Stephen D’Antuono, the director of the FBI’s Detroit field office, handled his agents executing the caper and how he was swiftly rewarded for his work. After his office successfully produced damaging headlines for Donald Trump right before the election, D’Antuono was promoted to head of the FBI’s D.C. office just three months before the Capitol protest.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, prosecutors have already told the defense that they have no intention of offering immunity to their now-tarnished star government witnesses. It’s unlikely a judge will avoid interfering in what is the sole purview of the Justice Department to offer immunity deals.</p> <p>But watching these FBI agents and informants repeatedly plead the Fifth on the stand may be as revealing as any protected testimony.</p>",3

The Supreme Court has consistently ruled in the administration's favor on questions of immigration and border enforcement.</p> <p>The latest turn in the case comes after the 9th Circuit halted the policy along the entire southern border on Friday but suspended its own order later that day after the government warned of dire consequences. “Remain in Mexico” is a crucial part of the Trump administration's response to large numbers of asylum-seekers appearing at the border.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>On Wednesday, the court ruled that the policy will no longer be in effect on Mexico's border with California and Arizona starting March 12 unless the Supreme Court wades in sooner. It declined to extend its order to federal courts in the two other southern border states — New Mexico and Texas.</p> <p>Judges William Fletcher and Richard Paez, both appointed by President Bill Clinton, said they acknowledged that nationwide orders applied to places outside a court's jurisdiction are “a matter of intense and active controversy.”</p> <p>They reaffirmed their view that the policy, known officially as “Migrant Protection Protocols,” is illegal under U.S. law to prevent sending people to countries where their lives or freedom would be threatened because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a particular social group.</p> <p>There is no question about “the extreme danger to asylum seekers who are returned to Mexico,"" they wrote.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, disagreed with blocking the policy at all.</p> <p>Judy Rabinovitz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to end the policy, emphasized the majority's opinion that it's illegal.</p> <p>“If the administration had any respect for the law or any sense of decency, it would end this program immediately,” she said. ""We will continue working to permanently end this illegal and inhumane policy.”</p> <p>The Justice Department declined to comment. In a court filing Tuesday, it warned of “massive disruption to the government’s immigration operations and sudden confusion for thousands of migrants about their ability to enter the United States. ”</p> <p>About 60,000 asylum-seekers have been returned to Mexico to wait for their cases to wind through clogged U.S. immigration courts since the policy was introduced in January 2019 in San Diego and later expanded across the border.</p> <p>Ad</p> <p>Human Rights First, an advocacy group that opposes the policy, said it found more than 1,000 public reports of kidnappings, torture, rape and assaults of asylum-seekers returned to Mexico.</p>",3
952550434,The natural resource curse in Cabo Delgado,2020-10-21 00:00:00,"<p>Over the past decade, there has been an increase in foreign investment in energy and gas development in Mozambique in East Africa. But since October 2017, attacks in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado – believed to be exacerbated by contestation over these resources – have morphed into extremism in a region with fertile conditions for it to thrive. As a result, a humanitarian crisis has reared its head.</p> <p>Oil deposits, liquefied natural gas fields and gemstones, projected in 2010 to be worth billions, have culminated in a shift in the political and social climate in neglected Cabo Delgado. Extremist insurgents, which some have claimed are linked to Islamic State, are operating with a sophistication and weaponry that have not previously been seen in the country. Their exact demands and political and economic ideology are currently unknown. Some have argued that there is no evidence of a direct link to Islamic State and that this narrative is being driven by the Mozambican state and the multinationals, because it is likely to bolster powerful external forces to mobilise against the insurgency.</p> <p>According to the United Nations, more than 300 000 people have been displaced, while more than 2 000 civilians have been killed. Experts say the violence, which has left villages abandoned as many flee to safety, cannot solely be linked to the Islamic State.</p> <p>Zenaida Machado, Angola and Mozambique researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, says the needs of the people living in the affected areas must be prioritised over profit. “The richest resource that Mozambique has is not the gas, oil or rubies, it’s the people. There is no point in defending multinationals and all the wealth that they are bringing when those villages will be completely abandoned either because the residents have died, or because they ran away,” she said.</p> <p>Cabo Delgado, like the rest of the country, has a high unemployment rate. There were a number of young artisanal miners working in the area before multinational corporations swooped in. Youths who needed jobs were kicked out and became vulnerable to the insurgency, and the external drive to make them join it has grown since.</p> <p>Bitter fruits of discontent</p> <p>Machado says the insurgents are able to operate in the province because they are able to exploit local political discontent. “When people find themselves hopeless, with no one to help them and nowhere to hide, there is the idea of if you can’t beat them, rather join them. And there is also the kidnapping element, where young men and young boys are kidnapped to join the insurgents. We had a situation of young men being massacred a few months back for refusing to join,” she said.</p> <p>If anything has been done to protect the people living in the affected areas, it has not yet been felt or seen. People are afraid of sleeping in their homes, opting to spend nights in the bush so that they can spot imminent danger, flee and escape. “Families are having to walk long distances to get to accommodation… People are running away from the violence and seeking refuge in Covid-19 hotspots because those are the only safe areas for them to be,” said Machado.</p> <p>Énio Viegas Filipe Chingotuane, head of the department of peace and security at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Maputo, says no single theory can meaningfully explain the origin of Cabo Delgado’s violent extremism. “Only a mixed explanation can bring us close to the real motives, causes and reason for the uprising,” he said.</p> <p>Chingotuane says Mozambique is a fragile state from every point of view and there are many factors that lure extremists, particularly in the marginalised Cabo Delgado, which he says can be called “an ungoverned territory”.</p> <p>“It is the poorest province with high unemployment, and no fair share of the wealth because of greed and corruption. The revenue is directed to things that aren’t a priority, crippled further by a weak judicial system and a partisan security force… There is a need to save lives. They [the government] are doing certain things right, but there is a lot which is kept secret and this makes it difficult to assess what they are doing” says Machado.</p> <p>Machado adds that if the government had the ability to handle the insurgency, it would not have struck deals with multinational corporations. “The level of destruction that this group [of insurgents] has created without us knowing who they are? I don’t want to see what they will do once we know who they are… Right now it’s about proving their strength.”</p> <p>The role of multinationals</p> <p>Many have contested the view that multinational corporations should be approached for solutions as they are largely seen as part of the problem. The Mozambican government and French energy giant, Total recently signed the biggest energy deal in Africa, worth billions of dollars. Total has clinched the largest share in the deal’s liquefaction projects, but there is interest from other partners too.</p> <p>“My concern with Total is that all that discussion about security never discusses people, it always discusses the infrastructure, the staff of the multinationals, the expatriates,” said Machado. “It doesn’t discuss the locals and I find it very unfair, disgusting and inhumane that people who have lived in those areas for decades now are forced to run away because gas has been ‘discovered’. Or [they] see themselves ignored because the priority is not to defend them, it’s to defend the multinationals and the infrastructure of the big investments that are there.”</p> <p>The American multinational ExxonMobil and the Italian oil and gas company Eni SpA, which are also investing in the country, are in talks with the Mozambican government to protect their workers while monitoring the situation.</p> <p>Chingotuane says eight main districts in the northern region have been affected, namely Mocímboa da Praia, Palma, Nangade, Muidumbe, Macomia, Meluco, Quissanga and Ibo. Traumatised locals flee to safety and refuge in districts with semi-guaranteed security such as Pemba, Metuge, Mueda, Montepuez and others. On 13 October, Minister of Health Armindo Tiago announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19, and although infection numbers stand at just more than 10 000 in the country, Pemba is known to be a virus hotspot.</p> <p>The port in Mocímboa da Praia, a strategic logistical location, was taken over for the third time in mid-August by a group of insurgents. This led to a disruption in the heavily foreign-backed project as the port is used to transport building materials, oil and gas equipment.</p> <p>Although a security force contingency has been sent to deal with the insurgency and regain the port, it remains to be seen if the state can contain it as it is understaffed, underequipped and underfinanced. Chingotuane argues that the state has no ability to handle the insurgency on its own.</p> <p>“Mozambican security forces are in a bad shape due to many years of low funding and neglect. None of its arms is up to the task in Cabo Delgado. The air force is almost nonexistent, the navy is far from its military capacity and the army is [struggling] to maintain its functionality and execute its mission. The cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineering and communications are all badly affected by poor financing. Problems also involve strategy, doctrine, logistics, training and military exercises,” said Chingotuane.</p> <p>Government response</p> <p>On Sunday 4 October, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said he would continue strengthening the military intervention capacity of the defence and security forces so that they can respond “more effectively to terrorist attacks”.</p> <p>He was speaking at Praça dos Heróis (Heroes’ Square) in Maputo, incidentally on the same day that the country celebrated its Peace and National Reconciliation Day. The holiday marks the end of the 15-year civil war between ruling party Frelimo and rebel group turned political movement, Renamo, with an agreement signed in Rome in 1992.</p> <p>“We strongly condemn these acts and reiterate that, as a state, we will continue to use all the resources at our disposal to guarantee public order and security, because the Mozambican people deserve to have a country at peace,” said Nyusi.</p> <p>On 29 September, Nyusi was named the 2020 “Person of the Year” by Africa Oil & Power, an investment platform for the energy sector. The accolade goes to people who supposedly display “true leadership and innovative thinking in steering their countries … to the forefront of the global energy sector”.</p> <p>Also in September, Reuters reported that Mozambique approached the European Union for help and support in training local security forces to counter the recurring wave of attacks. This is a different strategy from the initial denial, dismissal and downplaying of the attacks as criminal activity.</p> <p>Security forces’ role</p> <p>Machado says the security forces behaving in hostile ways towards suspects, who could be innocent, breeds anger and resentment among the population. “We have documented in the past cases where security forces arrived in a village following an attack and rounded up people. Any person that was seen running away, carrying machetes or [who was] still physically okay in a place of chaos was seen as a suspect.”</p> <p>In 2019, Human Rights Watch raised concerns over the number of people being detained unlawfully in overcrowded cells for lengthy periods, including women with young babies who were accused of aiding the insurgents. They were later released owing to a lack of evidence linking them to the conflict, and the judiciary pleaded with the security forces to exercise caution during arrests.</p> <p>Machado says there is a need for everyone to go through the lawful justice process because many have been arrested and have not seen a court, which allows for radicalisation to take place. “Many are arrested and placed in jail for months in the same cells with insurgents. Once released, they are either further radicalised, recruited or join voluntarily, or they are unable to be located as they do not return to their villages because of the fear of reprisals and stereotypes,” she said.</p> <p>In disturbing footage circulated in September, a naked woman is seen running as she is hounded by a group of men – one of whom is video recording the incident – clad in security force uniforms and carrying heavy arms. As the woman slows down, they catch up to her and one starts beating her with what looks like a stick before telling her to go. Another man then shoots her at close range before she is hit by a hail of more than 30 bullets. Even when her lifeless body is on the floor and a man says in Portuguese “that’s enough”, different men continue to shoot at her before one says proudly to the camera, “We have killed Al-Shabaab.”</p> <p>On 10 September, Colonel Omar Nala Saranga, a spokesperson for the defence ministry, said “one of the tactics used by terrorists in their macabre incursions against the population is to pretend to be elements of the FDS [Defence and Security Forces]”. He denied Amnesty International’s allegations of abuses by claiming that the videos and pictures were fake. He distanced the FDS from the murder and essentially claimed that it was the work of militants. In mid-September, the ministry condemned the act but did not confirm or deny that these were members of its rapid intervention unit.</p> <p>Machado says the actions of the security forces and the government are boosting rather than reducing the capacity of the insurgents, and the government is losing the trust of the people as more heinous allegations of human rights violations, including beheadings and torture, surface.</p> <p>“They need to stop people from being recruited. In an environment of mistrust and resentment, it’s very easy to divide and rule. And if the government really wants to recover that trust from the Mozambicans, one thing they should do is to communicate better on what they are doing and protect people… People also need to see people in uniforms as their protectors, not their offenders or abusers,” she said.</p> <p>Humanitarian crisis</p> <p>In areas such as Macomia and Mocímboa da Praia, where villages have been attacked and the conflict has been problematic, the healthcare offered was already deficient before the violence flared up. “Humanitarian groups that were operating in some of those areas … have left because of the [lack of] security. The kind of shelter they had was poor, but some of it was also destroyed by Cyclone Kenneth which hit the country, so the government was already struggling to take care of people in those regions,” said Machado.</p> <p>At the end of September, Minister of Economy and Finance Adriano Maleiane stated that a finance margin was needed to redirect resources to support “the war effort”, describing the situation in Cabo Delgado as bad for families and the economy. “The few resources we are allocating to the social areas are not sufficient and we must invent … more resources for the war,” he said in Maputo.</p> <p>However, Machado says the government needs to ensure that there are strategies in place to deal with the humanitarian crisis coming out of this conflict. “In a moment of conflict, all the resources available go to ensure that the insurgents are defeated and the locals are left on their own… Those who manage to get to camps find other challenges such as a lack of tents, low supplies of food, sanitation issues, cholera and malaria.</p> <p>“People need shelter, they need food, missing persons will need to be found, children have been away from school for the past three years, hospitals and schools are getting destroyed. The level of trauma that these people are affected by is high,” she said.</p> <p>This article was first published on New Frame</p>",3

1014096870,"Journalist arrested, charged after reporting on attacks against Christians in Nigeria",2021-11-12 18:23:00-05:00,"<p>Journalist arrested, charged after reporting on attacks against Christians in Nigeria</p> <p>A Nigerian journalist faces prolonged detention allegedly for his reporting about attacks against predominantly Christian communities in Nigeria and the government’s response.</p> <p>Luka Binniyat, a Nigerian Roman Catholic journalist and father who writes for the anti-communist Epoch Times, was arrested last week. On Tuesday, Binniyat was arraigned at the Barnawa Magistrate’s Court in Kaduna state. He was charged with cyberstalking, a charge that critics say is often used in the African country to silence the media.</p> <p>On Nov. 4, Binniyat informed Epoch Times Africa Desk Editor Doug Burton that he was arrested and urged the editor to “contact all relevant persons.”</p> <p>Burton elaborated on the circumstances leading up to Binniyat’s arrest and the dangers he faces in an interview with The Christian Post.</p> <p>Burton attributed Binniyat’s arrest to an Oct. 29 article he wrote titled “In Nigeria, Police Decry Massacres as ‘Wicked’ But Make No Arrests.” The article is part of The Epoch Times’ coverage of the deadly persecution of Christian farming communities in the African country that human rights advocates say have escalated to near “genocidal levels” in recent years as thousands have been killed.</p> <p>In the article, Binniyat pushed back on Kaduna’s Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan’s characterization of an attack on Christian farmers in the state as a “clash.”</p> <p>The Nigerian government has long refuted claims by human rights activists that a religious genocide is taking place in Nigeria’s Middle Belt states, where radicals from the Fulani herding community have been accused of invading countless Christian farming communities. The government has long attributed attacks and reprisals as being part of decades-old farmer-herder clashes.</p> <p>In his article, Binniyat included a quote from a Nigerian senator, who accused the Kaduna government of “using Samuel Aruwan, a Christian, to cause confusion to cover up the genocide going on in Christian Southern Kaduna by describing the measure as a ‘clash’” as opposed to a targeted act of violence against Christians.</p> <p>“What he [Binniyat] did there is he showed that the commissioner was projecting a false narrative,” Burton explained. “For this reason, I think the authorities, though they knew they would get pushback for prosecuting a dissident journalist, they decided they had to do it because … they want to shut his voice down.”</p> <p>Burton told CP that the journalist was accused of cyberstalking Aruwan. Cyberstalking is a federal offense.</p> <p>“The magistrate ruled that he does not have authority to try the charge of cyberstalking because it’s a federal charge, it’s a federal statute. So the case will have to be transferred to a federal court. And so, therefore, in the meantime, he can’t get bail because the magistrate doesn’t have authority to give him bail since he doesn’t have authority over this crime.”</p> <p>Sources Burton spoke to believe that the prosecution is using a “legal technicality to keep Luka in jail.”</p> <p>“By having his charges presented first in a lower court, a district court where he was charged, they expected him to be charged with defamation and injurious falsehood,” Burton said. “These are statutes … in the criminal code in Nigeria and can be tried at the lower court level.”</p> <p>“But the charge of … cyberstalking is a federal charge that … has to be issued by a higher court,” he continued. “And so by doing that deliberately, the prosecution knew that bail couldn’t be given, and that is the whole idea.”</p> <p>On Monday morning, Binniyat “texted that he felt like his life was in danger,” Burton said.</p> <p>Additionally, Binniyat said he had been held for five days in a very “cramped” and “dingy” cell that he described as “uncomfortable.” Binniyat further alleged that he hadn’t gotten much sleep.</p> <p>“He texted to another person, another journalist I know named John Shiklam. And Shiklam said he feared for his life,” Burton detailed.</p> <p>Based on conversations with other people who have faced detention for cyberstalking in Nigeria, Burton estimates that Binniyat could spend about five months in prison.</p> <p>Burton specifically cited the case of Stephen Kefas, who “wrote something on Facebook that embarrassed” a government official. The government official claimed he was being cyberstalked and feared he could be attacked because of what Kefas wrote.</p> <p>Burton indicated that prolonged detention could have an impact on Binniyat’s physical health.</p> <p>“The folks who have to spend time in custody, they have to endure pretty harsh conditions and they get sick,” he warned.</p> <p>Kefas contracted Hepatitis C while in prison, and members of the Adara tribe who spent time in prison caught malaria, typhoid and/or dysentery, Burton stressed.</p> <p>“Based on what I have learned with my many conversations with Steven Kefas, the conditions in prison are not only uncomfortable, but they’re dangerous and toxic,” he stated. “The Adara elders were in a common cell with other criminals. They had no toilet. They have a sewer trench that goes through the middle of the cell, which serves as their toilet. Apparently, the prisoners don’t have proper protection from mosquitoes because many of them come out with malaria.”</p> <p>Based on a conversation Burton had International Committee on Nigeria Executive Director Kyle Abts, who has delivered rations to prisoners in the past, “the prisons … and jails don’t provide food and water for the prisoners.”</p> <p>“All their food and water has to be brought to them by their relatives,” he said.</p> <p>Those without relatives or anyone to bring them food and water can “beg for charitable donations” from other prisoners.</p> <p>Because Binniyat is “not wealthy,” Burton predicted “he will need assistance” in his legal proceedings.</p> <p>“His legal bills will have to be paid by his friends. That would be the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, SKPU, and also he will be getting some financial aid probably from the International Committee on Nigeria,” Burton detailed. “His friends and allies are … planning some kind of a legal defense fund, but it’s not clear who will take the lead.”</p> <p>Binniyat’s arrest for cyberstalking is not the first time the journalist has faced legal headwinds for his reporting.</p> <p>Burton recalled that Binniyat was previously imprisoned in 2017 for “breach of the peace.”</p> <p>Binniyat had previously served as the bureau chief of Vanguard Newspapers until 2017.</p> <p>“Then after he was imprisoned, I don’t think he got hired by any newspaper group because, the way it was explained to me, he’s considered a controversial reporter,” he said.</p> <p>“So I started working with him in March this year, maybe May of this year. And I encouraged him to … compile reports for The Epoch Times. I worked with him as his editor. And so he’s published some very timely and factual reports about kidnappings and mass murders this year.”</p> <p>Burton maintained that the central claim made by Aruwan highlighted in Binniyat’s Oct. 29 story, that the attacks on Christian farming communities in Nigeria are simply “clashes” between farmers and herders, is widely held and promoted by Nigerian government officials.</p> <p>“That is a distorted representation of what’s really happening. In fact, there is a farmer-herder aspect to the violence,” the editor added. “But that discounts the fact that the preponderance of the attacks are sectarian in … nature.”</p> <p>1</p> <p>2</p> <p>Next</p>",3

Save our world from such beasts!""Unidentified armed men kidnapped a young woman, Dua Mangi, and shot her friend, Haris Fatah, in Karachi’s Bukhari Commercial area of DHA on Saturday evening.The incident occurred at around 8pm on a secluded road near the popular open-air tea cafes in the area.The kidnapped woman, Dua, was walking with her friend, Haris, when four to five persons in a car attempted to force her to get in their vehicle.When Haris resisted, they shot him and sped off with Dua.Soon after the incident, multiple posts went up on social media, informing the public and the authorities of the incident.A report has been registered at Darakshan Police Station against unidentified men, under sections of the Pakistan Penal Code pertaining to kidnapping and attempted murder on behalf of the injured man’s father, Abdul Fatah.</p>",3

980413594,Fighting the drug menace through advocacy,2021-04-18 07:25:49+01:00,"<p>By Nicholas Kalu, Abuja</p> <p>Since Brig Gen Buba Marwa assumed office as the new chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), about three months ago, it is starkly clear there is something different about the agency.</p> <p>From headlines across various news outlets on a string of major drug busts and arrests to a surge in activities at their Gimbiya Street Headquarters in Abuja, it is easy to tell there is more verve.</p> <p>Activities seemed to have picked up with a frenzy that sharply contrasted with a lethargy that seemed to have enveloped the essence of the anti-drug agency before now. Things are not as they used to be at the NDLEA.</p> <p>On his first day in office on January 18, 2021, Marwa had already started wielding the big stick. It would no longer be business as usual he had warned everyone involved in the illicit drug business.</p> <p>He had said the agency would be overhauled and expanded, in line with the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Drug Abuse (PACEDA).</p> <p>The new chairman, who had served as chairman of PACEDA, said it will also be within existing financial constraints, and the authorization of the appropriate superior authorities.</p> <p>Marwa had said the number of drug users in Nigeria today is over 15 million people, across all ages, adding that the problem has eaten very deeply into the social fabric as every community in Nigeria is affected.</p> <p>He said as a lead agency in the drug war in Nigeria, they were familiar with the extent of the devastation that drug use has caused the nation, and vowed to resuscitate and reposition NDLEA to full active life, to be effective, respected and feared by concerned criminals.</p> <p>Read Also: Minister assures on creation of 100m jobs</p> <p>Many stakeholders had upon Marwa’s assumption of office stakeholders had welcomed the development, describing him as a square peg in a square hole.</p> <p>For instance, the African Council on Narcotics has lauded the appointment, describing it as “one of the best national appointments that has been made by the present administration.”</p> <p>President of the Council, Rekpene Bassey, in a statement in Abuja said it was an appointment well deserved given Marwa’s known track record of excellent performance in previous national appointments.</p> <p>“While we feel certain that your present position will not be an exception, we note here the assurances of our prayers, trusting God will help you succeed in the massive task ahead considering the frightening increase in the illicit drug problem in our country. Needless to say, we will be more than delighted to work with your good self on this onerous task in the hope that you will leave the NDLEA better than you met it,” Bassey had said.</p> <p>Marwa, it appeared, hit the ground running by summoning Commanders of the agency in all the states of the federation and special commands with marching orders to mop up illicit drugs across the country.</p> <p>He went ahead to distribute operational vehicles that had been lying fallow at the agency’s headquarters for a long time, to some states that needed them.</p> <p>A flurry of drug busts and arrests on a scale hitherto absent had followed in the first month of his assumption of office.</p> <p>Seeming to want to identify with a more proactive spirit, various international organizations had already pledged their cooperation to the agency to achieve its mandate. Various alliances – national and international -have also been pursued by the Agency towards fighting the battle against drugs.</p> <p>Still in the spirit of building alliances towards the ultimate aim of ridding the country of the menace of drug abuse, Marwa recently visited the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Abuja, to explore areas of collaboration.</p> <p>In the meeting, the NDLEA Boss pointed out that as much as the agency’s efforts were disrupting the drug supply chain through law enforcement, they also needed to be more proactive and work hard on drug demand reduction through advocacy programmes, which are mostly publicity driven.</p> <p>The visit, he said, was to leverage on the Minister’s position to drive their advocacy programmes at little or no cost because it is well known that the NDLEA has over the years been left behind in terms of funding among other law enforcement agencies including those established years after them.</p> <p>Marwa however noted that despite their constraints, the Agency has in less than three months with him on the saddle, been able to seize drugs and cash worth over N75 billion.</p> <p>Within the period 2,175 drug traffickers had been arrested while 2,050,766.33 kilogrammes of assorted illicit drugs had been seized. Also 2,000 drug cases had been filed in court with 329 convictions and 1,549 pending cases, he revealed.</p> <p>“These figures are less than what could have been on the streets destroying the lives of innocent youths, our women and men. With the support of your office and those of your agencies, we’ll be able to save millions of Nigerians from being afflicted with the menace of drug abuse,” Marwa said.</p> <p>The NDLEA boss acknowledged the efforts of the Minister and leading agencies under him, in promoting the good work of the federal government and the country as a whole.</p> <p>“No doubt, the Minister’s current role is central to all key activities of government and the agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, especially with key information dissemination media outlets like the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), the Voice of Nigeria (VON) and more under the supervision of the Honourable Minister,” he said.</p> <p>He acknowledged that even without any prompting from the Minister, these agencies have been of tremendous support since he came on board.</p> <p>He said Nigeria is faced with a major drug crisis that is in no small way fueling most of the security challenges being faced in the North East, North West, North Central and indeed across the country.</p> <p>He noted that recently, through intelligence based operations, they were able to arrest some drug traffickers – one a Nigerien and another a Chadian in Niger state and Taraba state respectively – who supplied illicit drugs to insurgents and bandits.</p> <p>He again stressed the need to proactively combat the problem not just through enforcement but through advocacy.</p> <p>“For instance, we need to run a weekly 30mins network programme on NTA and Radio Nigeria to reach Nigerians on the dangers of drug abuse; we need to reach those at the grassroots with our messages in various Nigerian languages packaged in jingles; we need coverage of our programmes to promote the coming World Drug Day on June 26 and others.</p> <p>“We don’t have the resources to pay for all of these and this is why we need partnership with the Ministry of Information and its Agencies to be able to reach millions of Nigerians and save them from the drug scourge,” Marwa appealed.</p> <p>The Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who assured the agency of support, commended Marwa for his impressive string of achievements, in less than three months of assuming office.</p> <p>“These achievements, I am reliably informed, include restoring the visibility of the NDLEA for local and international partnership; boosting the morale and confidence of staffers; attracting international support and ‘offensive action’ against drug cartels</p> <p>that has led to the arrest of 2,175 drug traffickers, seizure of 2,050,765.33 kilogrammes of illicit drugs as well as cash and drug seizures worth N75 billion,” Mohammed said.</p> <p>Mohammed said the war against illicit drugs and tackling drug trafficking is one of the most important tasks in the country.</p> <p>This he said is because drug trafficking, money laundering by traffickers and the use of illicit drugs are closely linked to the nation’s security, well being of the citizens, the moral fabric of our society and even governance.</p> <p>“It is common knowledge that drug money can be used to finance insurgency and terrorism. A successful fight against drug trafficking will therefore help to deny or reduce funding for insurgency.</p> <p>“The kind of vicious banditry and kidnapping for ransom that our country has witnessed in recent times cannot be totally separated from illicit drug use and their effects on users who take to crime</p> <p>“Drug trafficking proceeds are sometimes invested into legitimate businesses, making hard working and honest people look indolent.</p> <p>“What about the effect of drug trafficking on the moral fabric of the society. This society rarely questions the source or sources of people’s wealth. That’s why drug traffickers end up becoming role models in the society, with devastating consequences for our young ones.</p> <p>“Even governance is not spared. Drug traffickers and money launderers contest and win elections into high offices, where they help shape policy. Just imagine the damage this can do to governance and indeed to any nation.</p> <p>“This is why I want to once again commend Gen. Marwa for raising the bar in the fight against drug cartels and the use of illicit drugs with the new maxim, ‘offensive action’.</p> <p>“The Federal Ministry of Information and Culture will work with you to give maximum publicity to your activities, especially in the area of advocacy. To date, we have launched a number of national campaigns. It will not be a bad idea for the Ministry, working with the NDLEA, to launch a national campaign against drug trafficking and use of illicit drugs.</p> <p>“I will also encourage the NDLEA to work with the National Orientation Agency (NOA), which has set up Integrity Clubs in Secondary Schools nationwide, to reach the young ones with its campaign against drug use,” he said.</p>",3

The gang then drove off to a secluded cabin, according to police.</p> <p>Initially he was kept in another building on the second floor, but he tried to escape, jumping from a height of about 15 feet and breaking both of his legs in the process. One of the kidnappers applied a plaster cast to his legs but it was not much help because the legs were in very serious condition, police said.</p> <p>After that, the victim was taken to the Fastovsky district of Kyiv, to one of the abandoned houses in the farmsteads in the forest behind the village.</p> <p>“One of the kidnappers had a grandmother who lived in that forest; he knew those places well. It was convenient; the place was silent, one where you would not attract the attention of others,” Krishchenko told Obozrevatel.</p> <p>The man was held in the basement and was forced to eat and relieve himself in the same room. His captors beat him and when he tried to escape, they shot him, Kirshchenko said.</p> <p>Police were able to track down the businessman and rescue him after his wife reported him missing the next morning.</p> <p>The police have detained the person who ordered the kidnapping and six others as well. “The customer received neither money, nor valuables, nor assets from the businessman,” Kirshchenko said, according to the report. Most of the details are still under a gag order since the investigation is still active.</p>",3
987712913,Students abducted by gunmen in north central Nigeria,2021-05-30 00:00:00,"<p>LAGOS, Nigeria — A large number of students were abducted Sunday and one person was killed at a school in Nigeria’s north central Niger State, a police spokesman said.</p> <p>Nigerian media, including the independent Channels TV, said about 200 students were abducted at the Salihu Tanko Islamic School in Tegina in the local government area of Rafi.</p> <p>Wasiu Abiodun, the Niger state police spokesman, confirmed the incident, though without giving a number for those abducted.</p> <p>He said the abduction was carried out by “armed bandits on board motorcycles in their numbers.” The gunmen fired “indiscriminately and abducted a yet to be ascertained number of children,” he said, adding that the gunmen shot one person dead in the process.</p> <p>All “tactical teams” have been mobilized to rescue the victims and the police will “ensure that the children are rescued unhurt,” he said.</p> <p>The incident is the latest in a series of mass abductions in Nigerian schools by armed gangs who collect money for ransom. Armed groups have carried out raids on schools in northern Nigeria, kidnapping hundreds of students since December. The worst incident this year occurred at the Government Girls Secondary School Jangebe in February, when 279 girls were abducted and later released.</p> <p>Many schools have been forced to close due to the frequent incidents.</p> <p>On Saturday, 14 university students and staff who had been abducted from Greenfield University in Kaduna state on April 20 were released after spending more than a month in captivity.</p>",3
986600518,Belarus ‘hijacking’ is test for international community,2021-05-24 00:00:00,"<p>Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, has unleashed a brutal campaign against his opponents. More than 35,000 people have been arrested, thousands have been tortured or abused, and 400 political prisoners are currently behind bars. Earlier this week a 50-year-old opposition activist, Vitold Ashurok, died in a penal colony. The official cause of death was “heart attack”. His widow believes he was murdered.</p> <p>It is against this dark and repressive backdrop that the extraordinary events of Sunday took place. According to state media, Lukashenko personally authorised the forced downing of a Ryanair plane as it flew over Belarusian airspace between Greece and Lithuania – a real-time hijacking. He even dispatched a MIG-29 fighter jet to ensure the pilot complied after being informed of a fake bomb threat.</p> <p>The target of Lukashenko’s fury was a 26-year-old passenger and opposition blogger, Roman Protasevich. Protasevich is the co-founder of Nexta, a Telegram channel. Since last August’s presidential election, widely seen as rigged, it has reported on, and coordinated demonstrations against, the Belarus regime. These continue. Like other critics he had left Belarus for exile. And what he must have thought was the safety of the EU.</p> <p>Protasevich was arrested when his plane landed in Minsk. His Russian girlfriend who was with him, Sofia Sapega, was detained too. Their whereabouts are unknown. The shocking incident has provoked widespread international condemnation and horror. On Monday Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, called it “air piracy”. Foreign ministers have dubbed it in-flight kidnapping, blatant “state terrorism” and sheer thuggery.</p> <p>The dilemma for western governments is how to respond. According to Andrei Sannikov, a former Belarus presidential candidate imprisoned in 2010, the regime is not merely enacting the worst domestic crackdown in Belarus since its independence from the Soviet Union – beating up its own, as he put it. It poses a grave threat to other countries, he said. Most of the passengers on board – 171 of them – were EU citizens.</p> <p>Sannikov described Lukashenko’s embattled Moscow-backed government as “absolutely insane”. “Yes, Lukashenko is a psychopath, a dangerous one,” he said. He added: “This is a test for the international community in general. The west has yet to find instruments and tools to deal with him. Maybe the hijacking will trigger something. These are not empty threats. Not even North Korea would do something like this.”</p> <p>The hijacking raises the nightmarish prospect that Lukashenko may now carry out other special operations against critics living abroad. The head of Belarus’s KGB, Ivan Tsertsel, has promised to eliminate all “traitors to the motherland”. In April his colleague Gen Nikolai Karpenkov, head of internal forces, said participants in peaceful rallies would face “inevitable retribution” and be “treated as terrorists”. State TV has talked of Stalin-style killings.</p> <p>Just a few hours before his plane was forcibly landed, Protasevich reported he was under surveillance at Athens airport. A Russian-speaking man dressed in a T-shirt and chinos stood behind him during boarding and tried to take photos of his ID, he said. At Minsk four passengers slipped off the plane and disappeared. They appear to be intelligence officers working for Belarus’s KGB. At least two reportedly had Russian passports.</p> <p>02:00 Belarus seizes blogger after 'hijacking' Ryanair flight – video report</p> <p>If Russia had a role in the hijacking is unclear. Its FSB spy agency recently helped to arrest an opposition activist in Moscow accused of plotting a “coup” against Lukashenko and Russian state media has praised Belarus’s president for his “beautiful” and uncompromising move. The incident, some believe, will further estrange Belarus from Europe, to the Kremlin’s advantage.</p> <p>Already it has having a chilling effect on other dissidents. Natalia Kaliada, co-founder of the Belarus Free Theatre, was due to meet Protasevich this week. She told the Guardian she spoke with the pilot and airline on Sunday after boarding a flight from London to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. “The plane was put on alert. It avoided Belarus airspace. I’ve had multiple death threats since November and December,” she said.</p> <p>In recent months the mass protests against Lukashenko have diminished. According to Sannikov, however, the regime is weaker than it seems, with Lukashenko reliant on his security forces. Behind the scenes there are defections and suicides, he said. “Lukashenko doesn’t control the state anymore or the economy or government. He’s only meeting with the men in uniform,” he added. “The protests may be less. But hatred of Lukashenko personally is growing. It’s leading to an explosion.”</p> <p>According to Nigel Gould-Davies, Britain’s former ambassador in Minsk, the EU and UK should consult with the Belarus opposition co-ordinating committee before deciding on possible sanctions. “This isn’t only about Belarus,” he said. “If Belarus gets away with it other countries will likely be emboldened to have a malign interest in getting hold of people who have fled abroad.” Sunday’s events showed Lukashenko’s weakness, he pointed out, noting: “He can’t regain legitimacy.”</p> <p>For Belarus’s embattled journalistic community, meanwhile, it has been a disastrous period. The country’s biggest non-state media outlet – the website tut.by – was shut down last week, with many of its staff rounded up and arrested. Currently 30 journalists are in prison. They now include Protasevich, who faces charges of organising mass riots and organising group activities which “violate public order”. It is enough to see him jailed for years.</p>",3
