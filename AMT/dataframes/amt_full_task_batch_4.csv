1023433875,Digging into the real-world impact of disinformation and conspiracy in Scotland,2022-01-15 21:00:00,"<p>""DO you believe in any conspiracy theories?” one friend asks another.</p> <p>“Why?” comes the ­response. “Who are you working for?”</p> <p>But disinformation is no joke. In fact, SNP defence spokesperson Stewart McDonald says: “We don’t take it seriously enough.”</p> <p>Disinformation (a deliberate lie) and its close ­cousin misinformation (an accidental one) are ­ubiquitous in Scottish politics, feeding into a whirlwind of conspiracies affecting everyone across the political spectrum.</p> <p>Far from being confined to obscure online ­forums, these have begun to have real-world impacts. Just last weekend, police were forced to respond to an unauthorised anti-lockdown protest in Glasgow, while a group aiming to take action to prevent the “forced vaccination” of children is planning to hold a “bootcamp” in the city in the near future.</p> <p>The brother of former Labour leader Jeremy ­Corbyn, conspiracy theorist Piers Corbyn, was ­arrested on suspicion of encouraging people to “burn down MPs’ offices” in December, and a man was ­arrested on Wednesday after allegedly taking a ­hammer to a statue on the BBC’s London office which QAnon believers had campaigned against for years.</p> <p>Piers Corbyn</p> <p>Falsehoods and conspiracies have real-world ­consequences. They can, assistant professor ­Christian Baden explains, make us distrust one another and prevent any middle ground being found between believers and non-believers.</p> <p>Bader, along with his colleague at the Hebrew ­University of Jerusalem Tzlil Sharon, published a 2020 paper entitled Blinded By The Lies which looked at moving towards a unified definition of a conspiracy theory.</p> <p>“It is not what people believe,” Baden says, “but how exactly they believe it.”</p> <p>According to their paper, it’s not all about New World Orders and 9/11 inside jobs. Anything can be a conspiracy if it ticks three boxes.</p> <p>The first of these is the idea of “pervasive ­potency”. This says that the things are as they are because ­someone has willed it to be that way, and their ­agenda has agents everywhere.</p> <p>The second is the “Manichean binary”. Everything can be ordered into true and false, good and evil. There is no space for grey shade, and no space for discussion between the two sides.</p> <p>And the third – Baden calls it “the famous one” – is that “people believe things because they ­believe things”. What someone thinks is set in stone. ­Evidence is discounted if it disagrees with their prior conclusion and accepted if it matches it.</p> <p>While one US study found nine in 10 people rate themselves as “above average” in their ability to spot such disinformation and conspiratorial thinking, it also found those more confident in their abilities were more likely to be duped.</p> <p>And given a chance, disinformation has legs, sometimes such fast ones that falsehoods can make it all the way to the very top.</p> <p>In one example, the Tory leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, repeated claims of a “missing” £600,000 from SNP accounts. Despite the party clarifying that the funds were “accounted for minutely”, the cat had been let out of the bag.</p> <p>“What a massive coup to get your conspiracy ­theory read out by a member of the ­British ­Cabinet of the British ­Parliament,” ­McDonald says.</p> <p>The SNP MP has looked in depth at the issue on an international scale, including defence strategies from Finland and ­Sweden, and disinformation emanating from China, Iran and Russia. “It doesn’t matter who started it,” he says, “the fact it has got to the despatch box, what a coup!”</p> <p>Whether or not there is any truth to the allegations is of little consequence to Rees-Mogg. Protected by parliamentary privilege he can say anything without ­repercussions, and it serves to damage his political opponents.</p> <p>Once it has been said in parliament, it can be reported widely – and who is to say that “concerns” aren’t legitimate? This was, as Jared Stacy says, all about plausibility.</p> <p>Stacy, an American who moved to Scotland after his community became overrun with QAnon believers, is now conducting a phd in evangelicalism and conspiracies at Aberdeen University. Such conspiracies aren’t “just some national news story”, for him and his community, the impacts were felt “very, very personally”.</p> <p>Stacy says that sometimes ­conspiracies can spread because people legitimise the possibility of falsehoods being true. He talks of people who would “signal a sympathy for conspiratorial beliefs”.</p> <p>“People who just say ‘we don’t really know’, ‘this is probably plausible’, they do create a sense of respectability to these claims. They are responsible [to an extent].”</p> <p>And while those who entertain such ­disinformation may bear some responsibility, more falls on the ­shoulders of those who create it, using it to their own political ends. Such disinformation might take the form of attacks on ­minorities, on politicians, or on the judiciary.</p> <p>These may be open, like the Daily Mail’s now infamous “enemies of the people” front page claiming high court judges were deliberately blocking Brexit, or they may be a more subtle undermining of the rule of law.</p> <p>In one example, former diplomat Craig Murray was jailed for contempt of court after a judge ruled his reporting on Alex Salmond’s trial – which saw the former first minister fully acquitted – could have led to the identification of the ­complainants.</p> <p>Murray’s case shows it is not only the Unionist side which can become transfixed on ideas of conspiracy. The blogger was jailed for contempt of court in a case within the independent legal system. Yet, rumours on social media spread that he was a political prisoner, jailed for ­daring to report what the Government had ­wanted hidden.</p> <p>Both cannot have been true. He ­cannot have reported what the law said must ­remain secret, and at the same time not have been in contempt of court. The ­elusive nature of the claims that he did manage both at once are echoed in the third aspect of Baden and Sharon’s ­definition of a conspiracy.</p> <p>Other examples of disinformation don’t require the luxury of being afforded legitimacy by prominent figures or ­papers. A falsehood planted in fertile ground, where the people are willing to believe anything that seems to confirm what they hold to be true, can flourish unaided.</p> <p>Take one social media rumour which spread like wildfire over the festive ­period. Without basis, people have claimed that the First Minister went to Portugal on holiday.</p> <p>Screenshots were shared of flights from Glasgow to the Algarve, people claimed the “mainstream media” was sitting on the story and even, incredibly, that there could be a super-injunction preventing ­reporting of the holiday.</p> <p>One news site put out a call for ­information, and when the Scottish Government denied it all, suggested that the statement’s purpose had been to ­mislead.</p> <p>Labour peer George Foulkes tweeted: “We shouldn’t object if @NicolaSturgeon has taken a few days off. But we might wonder why it is apparently so secret.”</p> <p>George Foulkes</p> <p>It got to the point that when putting “Nicola Sturgeon” into Twitter’s search bar, the words “holiday” and “Portugal” were the top suggestions.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Scottish Conservative chief whip Stephen Kerr was forced into an ­embarrassing climbdown after he ­tweeted unsourced claims which had been circling on social media that the Scottish Government had set aside £350 million for indyref2.</p> <p>In another example, ahead of the first Covid lockdown in March 2020, Richard Lyle, the now retired SNP MSP, raised unsubstantiated online rumours of secret army bases being built around Glasgow to put the city into lockdown with the First Minister.</p> <p>He asked Nicola Sturgeon about ­“unconfirmed reports that army units are setting up in Strathclyde park” on March 19, 2020 – the same day the UK Defence Journal published its first fact check ­rubbishing the claims.</p> <p>Rumours such as these which start on social media often find fertile ground easily thanks to algorithms designed to increase engagement. “Liking” a post ­encourages platforms to show us more of the same. Ignoring one may lead to the algorithm keeping similar ones off our screens altogether.</p> <p>This is how echo chambers grow on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, despite having billions of diverse users across the globe. And these echo chambers can be ­manufactured.</p> <p>After Twitter banned Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 riots, the ­disgraced president declared he would sue them, and Facebook and Google for good measure, alleging a culture of ­“shadow banning” and anti-Conservative bias.</p> <p>Donald Trump</p> <p>His tactics clearly mirror Baden and Sharon’s three facets of conspiracy. The enemy is pervasive, having infiltrated all of the biggest of the big tech firms. It is firmly evil, positioned against “American freedom and at the same time, freedom of speech”. And it is elusive. It ignores the fact that, as a “massive-scale” study involving Twitter’s own team established late last year, right-wing voices ­actually enjoy greater amplification on the ­platform than their opponents.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Trump is using the ­language of conspiracy to push ­towards his own ends, causing an exodus of ­certain people from Twitter on to platforms such as Gettr, which was founded by his ­former aide Jason Miller.</p> <p>Often people may find themselves pushed on to such platforms by a single issue, such as fear of “censorship”, and once there find themselves exposed to ever more extreme ideologies.</p> <p>Other times, certain social media ­bubbles may have been created for the explicit purpose of radicalisation.</p> <p>“Most people’s connection to ­reality is mediated through our devices, our algorithmic choices, and choices that are made for us,” says Stacy.</p> <p>In an example McDonald highlights, the biggest BLM Facebook page in the US at one point was run by the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, the “Trolls from Olgino”.</p> <p>Stewart McDonald</p> <p>Slowly, the page began to distribute content which had nothing to do with BLM at all, but had the aim of discrediting Trump’s opponents and spreading hate.</p> <p>“Disinformation has always been a gateway to radicalisation,” McDonald says.</p> <p>However, Baden argues that it is not ­social media to blame. “It is a facilitation, not a cause,” he says. “What works on a global platform also works in the pub on the corner.”</p> <p>People will always find others who share their viewpoint, “it is just a lot easier to find them thanks to these ­algorithms, and it is a lot easier to delude yourself that this is all there is”.</p> <p>And when rumours spread through such communities, it can be near impossible to shut them down. This is especially true in the case of the “missing £600k”, Twitter’s anti-Conservative bias, or Nicola Sturgeon’s holiday, because the very people who have the authority and knowledge to debunk the claims are, in the eyes of the conspiracy, in on it.</p> <p>Conspiracy theorists will find ­themselves paraphrasing Mandy Rice-Davies’s famous comment during the Profumo Affair: “Well, they would say that, wouldn’t they?”</p> <p>Stacy says that when trying to convince people who have bought in to disinformation it’s key to take account of their ­dignity, and give them the tools they need to come to their senses.</p> <p>“The stakes are really high but they’re human stakes. You are talking about ­taking someone’s reality apart, and how do you do that?</p> <p>“The first thing is recognising that ­basically what you’re attempting to do is bring someone’s world crashing down.”</p> <p>Confidence tricksters have long ­relied on someone not wanting to admit to themselves that they may have been fooled. To have the truth revealed may be a painful and embarrassing experience. A person is unlikely to be converted by a single conversation.</p> <p>Stacy says you must look at it as if you’re “putting pebbles in their shoes”. Make walking the path of the conspiracy uncomfortable enough that they research sources outside of that online bubble.</p> <p>Talking people out of the “rabbit hole” takes time, and, McDonald says, any ­effort to fight disinformation which ­involves the government alone would be “spectacularly unsuccessful”.</p> <p>He says that there needs to be a focus on teaching young people how to spot fake news from an early age, and a programme which brings in “as many parts of society as possible, different languages, different cultures, people using different media across different age groups”.</p> <p>Such an effort would go some way to combating the first aspect of a conspiracy, the idea that the malevolent forces are pervasive. While it might seem plausible that the revolving door between government and media has led to a shared agenda, ­involving faith groups, trade unions, education institutions, charities, to name but a few, would go some way to ­debunking that idea.</p> <p>But, McDonald says, there is an opportunity for Scotland in all this. Like many other nations, the UK Government’s ­approach to combating disinformation is, he says, “a muddle”.</p> <p>Depending on its origins and ­categorisation, a falsehood may fall ­under the remit of the MoD, the ­Cabinet Office, the DCMS, Mi6, or multiple ­departments at once. McDonald says these ­diverse ­bodies struggle to communicate ­effectively enough to combat the “scourge of disinformation”.</p> <p>The SNP MP suggests that Scotland could host annual, worldwide “clean information” summits to help build a ­nation which is well protected against such threats, and well placed to help ­others going forward.</p> <p>But there may be a need to repair ­discourse in politics first.</p> <p>In the US, Stacy says: “There’s something about the rhetoric in our politics and our public square that is making us prone to seeing the worst in each other.”</p> <p>He adds: “Looking at the independence debate as an outsider it would not be hard to imagine further retrenchment into these ideological ghettos.”</p> <p>The polarised nature of the constitutional debate has only gotten more extreme since 2014, and where there is ­division, bad faith actors see opportunity.</p> <p>“They don’t create the division,” ­McDonald explains, “they work out where it is and exploit it”.</p> <p>“So long as we don’t take it seriously, and weaponisers of disinformation do take their role seriously, we will always be the poorer for it.”</p>",4
958490460,"Bharat Bandh invokes mixed response in UP, SP workers protest",2020-12-08 17:10:35+05:30,"<p>The Bharat Bandh called by farmer unions, protesting the three Central agri laws, drew a mixed response in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday with shops and offices remaining largely open, while the Samajwadi Party held protests in a number of districts and even holding up a train in Allahabad.</p> <p>Samajwadi Party leaders sat on a silent protest near the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh at the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow in support of the bandh. SP MLCs Rajpal Kashyap, Sunil Singh Sajan, Anand Bhadauria and Ashu Malik were part of it.</p> <p>However, life in state capital remained mostly unaffected with District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash saying that attendances in offices were absolutely normal.</p> <p>“The impact (of the Bharat Bandh) was zero in Lucknow as all the markets were open. The mandis were also open,” he said.</p> <p>Ashish Tripathi, a lawyer, said it was a normal day for him and his colleagues, and it took them almost the same time their office as on any other day.</p> <p>“Banking activity in the state was also by and large normal and there was no impact of Bharat Bandh,” Dilip Chauhan, the UP General Secretary of All India Bank Officers’ Confederation told PTI on Tuesday.</p> <p>Regional Manager of UPSRTC PK Bose said, “Passenger flow was less on Tuesday as compared to other days. However, operation-wise it was a normal day for us.”</p> <p>Samajwadi Party workers came out on the streets of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, raising slogans in support of the ‘Bharat Bandh’, leading to clashes with police at many places. They stopped the Bundelkhand Express at Prayagraj station, and raised slogans while sitting on the railway track.</p> <p>Allahabad Superintendent of Police (city) Dinesh Kumar Singh said, “Those who tried to hold up the Bundelkhand Express were taken into custody and the train later departed. Our teams are patrolling railway and bus stations and important places. So far, there has been no blockade of traffic and all markets are open.” Abhilash Basak, who runs a tour and travel agency in Allahabad, said, “Almost all the shops in the Civil Lines area are open and it is a normal day for us. Heavy police force has been deployed in the area.”</p> <p>Around 14 Samajwadi Party leaders in Banda were put under house arrest, while in Chitrakoot district, some SP workers who tried to stage a protest were arrested, police said. Some SP leaders in Mahoba were under house arrest from Monday itself.</p> <p>The call for bandh did not evoke any response in Amethi and Kaushambi as shops were open and business activities were normal. Shops remained open in Hamirpur, Jalaun and Lalitpur as well. In Bundelkhand the response to the call for bandh was partial and in Mau shops remained closed.</p> <p>In Mainpuri, lawyers abstained from work and the business at the wholesale grain market was affected, while for other establishments in the district it was a normal day.</p> <p>In Aligarh, hundreds of farmers squatted on a road leading to the Yamuna Expressway and blocked traffic for several hours. Samajwadi Party leader and former Lok Sabha MP from Aligarh Brijendra Singh and a group of party workers were arrested when they squatted a the crossing on the Exhibition Road in solidarity with the protesting farmers, police said.</p> <p>Despite some protests by SP and Congress workers in Gorakhpur, shops were open and traffic was as usual, while there was normal attendance in private and government offices. Police said that some political leaders and workers were detained for maintaining law and order.</p> <p>City Magistrate Abhinav Ranjan Srivastav said, “All markets were open and police and administrative officials were vigilant. Some people who violated section 144 of CrPC (which prevents assembly of five or more people at one spot), were detained to maintain law and order.” SP leader and former minister Arvind Singh Gope told PTI that he has been put under house arrest in Barabanki. Senior Congress leader Pradeep Mathur also claimed that he has been arrested along with many party workers in Mathura.</p> <p>There were also reports of Congress leaders and workers being put under house arrest or getting arrested in Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Chitrakoot, Saharanpur and Kanpur. A senior state government official, however, asserted that the situation was peaceful in the state.</p> <p>Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit alleged that instead of resolving problems faced by the farmers, attempts were being made to blame them.</p> <p>“This will prove costly,” he warned.</p> <p>Dixit alleged that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government never reached the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.</p> <p>“The government has to revamp its style of working, otherwise the issue of doubling the income of the farmers will only remain a day dream,” he said.</p> <p>Agitating farmer unions have given a call for a nationwide strike on Tuesday to press for the repeal of the Centre’s agri laws with almost all opposition parties and several trade unions backing the it and many announcing parallel protests in support of the farmers.</p> <p>The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.</p> <p>However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.</p>",4
894350602,Three French executives were convicted in the suicides of 35 of their workers,2019-12-21 01:01:00,"<p>Three former executives of a French telecommunications giant were found guilty on Friday of creating a corporate culture so toxic that 35 of their employees were driven to suicide in the mid-2000s. The charge in the historic case: ""harcèlement moral institutionnel,"" or ""institutional moral harassment.""</p> <p>The ruling from a Paris criminal court caps a months-long trial and years-long saga that has spurred protests and highlighted issues of labor relations and workplace conditions in a country with a sometimes contentious relationship to capitalism.</p> <p>The company, France Télécom - which used to be state-owned and is now known as Orange, one of France's largest corporations - was fined $83,000, the maximum penalty. Its ex-chief executive, Didier Lombard, was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $16,000, along with his former second-in-command and head of human resources.</p> <p>It is the first time a French company of Orange's size has been held to account for this type of workplace bullying.</p> <p>CFE-CGC Orange, a trade union that represents the company's workers, has been tracking employee suicides since 2007, and its leaders said they welcomed Friday's decision.</p> <p>""Our thoughts are with the victims and the families of the victims of managerial violence put in place by Didier Lombard and his henchmen,"" Sébastien Crozier, the shop's president, said in a statement. ""We hope that this judgment will serve as an example so that this type of situation never happens again.""</p> <p>Lombard and the two other former executives, the deputy Louis-Pierre Wenès and the HR director Olivier Barberot, plan to appeal the ruling, reported the news station France 24. Orange will not.</p> <p>The spate of suicides, which happened more than a decade ago, came as the company underwent a massive restructuring effort. Then France's national telephone company, France Télécom embarked on an aggressive plan to cut 22,000 workers and shift another 10,000 into new jobs - all between 2006 and 2008. Most of the employees, because they were civil servants, could not be fired.</p> <p>So, prosecutors said, the company's executives tried to make workers' lives so miserable they would leave voluntarily. Lombard, speaking to senior managers in 2007, reportedly vowed, ""I'll get them out one way or another, through the window or through the door.""</p> <p>In the ruling, the court said ""the means chosen to reach 22,000 departures were illegitimate,"" the New York Times reported. It was ""a conscious scheme to worsen the work conditions of the employees in order to speed up departures"" and it ""created a climate of anxiety"" that led to the suicides.</p> <p>The employee deaths were often shocking and violent. One man leaped to his death from a highway bridge in the French Alps. Another set himself on fire in the parking lot of the company's office near Bordeaux. At an office in Paris, a woman threw herself from a sixth-floor window.</p> <p>In many cases, suicide notes blaming the company accompanied them. In court, the Associated Press reported, one was projected on a large screen, reading: ""I am committing suicide because of my work at France Télécom, it's the only cause.""</p> <p>For years, however, the company downplayed the suicides, calling them not statistically surprising for a workforce so large.</p> <p>But during the trial, as victims' family members and co-workers testified, the executives displayed more contrition.</p> <p>Wenès said he was ""deeply sorry"" to ""those for whom work was a source of discomfort and suffering, I never wanted that,"" according to the AP.</p> <p>The ruling was announced as France grappled with more, but unrelated, labor turmoil. Friday marked day 16 of crippling strikes in response to President Emmanuel Macron's plans to overhaul the retirement system. Transport unions led the protests and have been joined by air traffic controllers, teachers and health workers, grinding daily activities in the capital to a halt.</p>",4
889233885,Egypt: UPR Submission November 2019,2019-11-26 00:00:00,"<p>Introduction</p> <p>President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi won a second presidential term in March 2018 elections that were held in a largely unfree and unfair environment. President al-Sisi rose to power on the heels of the June 30 mass protests, when he, as the then-defense minister, led the Egyptian military’s move to unseat Egypt’s first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi. He was elected for his first presidential term in the summer of 2014, and since that time his government has dramatically escalated the state’s repression and violence against his fellow citizens to stifle all forms of dissent.</p> <p>The human rights situation in Egypt has collapsed since Egypt’s last Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2014. Instead of implementing even small steps towards justice for the most serious crimes, authorities have relied on a state of emergency and repressive counterterrorism laws to suppress freedoms of expression and association and to largely silence peaceful dissent, including by prosecuting journalists and human rights activists. Abusive state agencies, particularly the Interior Ministry’s National Security Agency and the police, have tortured, abused, and disappeared opponents with near-total impunity. The government has further restricted basic freedoms, including through new legislation passed by parliament, which has largely become a rubber stamp for Al-Sisi’s policy decisions. The March 2018 presidential vote was held in an unfree, unfair environment. Under such severe repression, authorities have been moving to pass constitutional amendments that would end any judiciary independence and invite army intervention in politics.</p> <p>Legislative and Constitutional Human Rights Framework</p> <p>Though it contained important human rights guarantees, Egypt’s 2014 constitution fails to address many of the pressing rights issues in the country. In practice, authorities have shown little respect for constitutional guarantees of rights and have even passed laws that contradict them despite its acceptance of the 2014 recommendation to “continue efforts to harmonize national legislation with international norms.”</p> <p>Contrary to the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to “strengthen measures, including the adoption of necessary legislation, to give effect to the rights enshrined in ICCPR,” authorities have been using counterterrorism and state-of-emergency laws and courts to subvert rights protections and unjustly prosecute bloggers, activists, and ordinary citizens for their peaceful criticism.</p> <p>President al-Sisi declared a nation-wide state of emergency in April 2017, following Islamic State-claimed church bombings that killed 45 people. The state of emergency has been uninterruptedly renewed since then. The 1958 Emergency Law gives unchecked powers to security forces to arrest people and allows the government to impose media censorship and order forced evictions. A constitutional court ruling annulling some of these powers was quickly circumvented by new amendments the parliament passed that granted al-Sisi the power to re-apply these abusive practices.</p> <p>Examples of abusive new laws that severely undermine citizens’ rights include:</p> <p>Law 70 of 2017 known as the new NGO law. It effectively attempts to eliminate independent human rights work, places all NGOs under the effective veto power of a council dominated by representatives of the security agencies, and allows the government to dissolve NGOs based on broadly-worded infractions.</p> <p>Law 180 of 2018 for regulating media. It ushered in increased levels of government censorship of the media, including news websites and social media. Around 600 websites, including those of human rights and media organizations, have been blocked without a court order in 2017 and 2018.</p> <p>Law 95 of 2015 for counterterrorism. The law erodes basic rights and espouses an overly broad definition of terrorism that includes civil disobedience and free expression. It also prevents police officers from questioning for any use of force during counterterrorism operations.</p> <p>Law 8 of 2015 on “Terrorist Entities.” The government used the law to list hundreds of individuals and entities on the country’s “terrorism list” without any hearings or trials, and instead mainly based on unchallenged memos submitted by prosecutors.</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Repeal or drastically revise all abusive laws, including those listed above, and ensure that all laws comply with Egypt’s international obligations;</p> <p>Withdraw new constitutional amendments that would further undermine judiciary independence and provide for military intervention in politics.</p> <p>Impunity and Security Forces’ Serious Abuses</p> <p>Excessive Use of Force and Extrajudicial Executions.</p> <p>Egypt failed to implement the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to “investigate excessive use of force by security forces” and to “prosecute those identified as being responsible.”</p> <p>More than five years after the systematic mass killing of protesters in Rab’a Square in Cairo, in August 2013, the authorities did not question or investigate a single member of the security forces responsible for the killing of at least 817 people that day during their violent dispersal of the largely-peaceful sit-in supporting former President Mohamed Morsy.</p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch’s review of official Interior Ministry’s statements, the ministry’s security forces have killed at least 270 persons between 2015 and 2018 in more than 80 incidents which the ministry claimed the people were killed in shootouts but provided limited or no evidence to justify the deadly use of force. No transparent investigations were allowed into such incidents. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented how several of those incidents, two of which were video-recorded, appeared to be extrajudicial killings including the killing of previously detained persons in likely staged “shoot-outs.”</p> <p>Enforced Disappearance and ill-treatment and Torture.</p> <p>Egypt failed to implement the 2014 UPR recommendations to prosecute and punish “possible crimes committed by security officers” and to ensure “all detained persons are protected by law and physically against torture and all other ill-treatment.” A 2017 Human Rights Watch investigation discovered that torture is being used systematically and on a widespread scale in Egypt. Interior Ministry police and National Security Forces have disappeared hundreds of people in the past years and subjected scores to severe torture including by electric shocks, rape and threat of rape. Since July 2013, the independent campaign “Stop Enforced Disappearance” has documented 1,530 enforced disappearances from July 2013 to August 2018. According to the Egyptian newspaper Al Watan, which cited statistics from the Justice Ministry’s Forensic Medical Authority, at least 90 people died in local police stations and security directorates in the governorates of Cairo and Giza alone in 2014. This number reached 118 in 2017, according to a detailed report published by the Egyptian NGO El-Nadeem Centre.</p> <p>Egypt did not amend its laws to properly define torture and enforced disappearance crimes. On the contrary, the Egyptian government added more layers of protection for security officials. In July 2018, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi approved Law No.161 of 2018 on the “treatment of the armed forces’ senior commanders,” which shielded senior military commanders from being questioned for abuses that occurred between July 2013 and January 2016 unless the Supreme Council of Armed Forces gives permission. The 2015 counterterrorism law states that officers cannot be questioned for the use of force during counterterrorism operations.</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Ensure security forces act in accordance with international human rights laws and standards on the use of force, including the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;</p> <p>Ensure that all those detained are protected from torture or other ill-treatment, and that detention conditions meet international standards;</p> <p>Repeal all laws that grant impunity to security officials from being questioned over abuses such as the 2015 counterterrorism law;</p> <p>Bring the crimes of torture and enforced disappearance in national law into conformity with the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;</p> <p>Ensure that investigations into human rights violations are impartial, independent and effective. The Justice Ministry should appoint a commission composed of law professors, legal experts, human rights activists and prosecutors with concrete powers to transparently and openly initiate criminal investigations into torture and disappearance crimes;</p> <p>Immediately launch open, transparent investigations into the unlawful use of lethal force by security forces that has resulted in the killing of thousands of protesters and bystanders;</p> <p>Establish torture-prevention mechanisms including by allowing independent oversight over all detention places, and in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.</p> <p>Unfair Trials, Selective Justice and Death Penalty</p> <p>Since its 2014 UPR, Egypt also failed to implement an accepted recommendation to ensure “fair, equitable and independent judicial procedures.” In their prosecution of activists and peaceful opponents, Egyptian authorities used Emergency State Security Courts, a parallel judicial system re-instated since October 2017, under the state of emergency that the government uses to prosecute political activists. These courts do not guarantee a fair trial and their decisions are not subject to appeal. The 2014 constitution permits military trials for civilians. Between October 2014, when al-Sisi decreed a law that vastly expanded military court jurisdiction, and late 2017, authorities have referred more than 15,000 civilians to military prosecutions. Many of these unfair trials ended in death sentences. Egyptian laws provide for the death penalty for over 100 offenses. Death sentences and executions have sharply increased in recent years.</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Cease the practice of trying civilians before military trials;</p> <p>Abolish State Security Courts;</p> <p>Ensure that all those detained on recognizably criminal charges are tried in proceedings that fully conform with international fair trial guarantees, without recourse to the death penalty;</p> <p>Repeal all laws that allow for prosecuting people for peacefully exercising or demanding their civil, political, cultural and economic rights such as the 2018 new medial regulations and the 2013 protest law;</p> <p>Issue a moratorium on the death penalty as a matter of priority.</p> <p>Restrictions against Freedom of Expression, Assembly, and Association</p> <p>During its last UPR, Egypt accepted recommendations to “adopt the law affirming the right to establish nongovernmental organizations merely upon notification” and to provide and guarantee an environment “conducive to the work of journalists, human rights defenders and civil society organizations.” Despite this, President al-Sisi ratified the NGO law in May 2017 that criminalizes the work of NGOs, providing for up to five-year prison terms for failing to adhere to its provisions such as operating or receiving funds without government approval. During President al-Sisi’s tenure, Egypt has become among the worst three jailers of journalists in the world with roughly 25 journalists in jail in March 2019, despite the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to “guarantee the freedom of expression” and to “protect journalists from violence and harassment.” Authorities have continued the prosecutions of scores of the country’s leading human rights activists and organizations in case 173 of 2011, known as the “foreign funding” case, despite the UN, US, and EU calls to end them.</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Immediately cease harassment and persecution of opposition activists exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including defamation campaigns and threats;</p> <p>Release and drop charges against all those detained solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including national and international media personnel arrested in the context of performing their duties as journalists;</p> <p>Also release and drop charges against all those detained for exercising their rights to freedom of association, including those detained solely for membership in the Muslim Brotherhood. The government should amend Law 107 of 2013 restricting freedom of assembly to bring it in line with international standards on freedom of assembly and association.</p> <p>Abuses against Religious Minorities</p> <p>Egypt’s 2014 constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the rights of minorities and the country accepted a 2014 UPR recommendation to ensure “the respect for freedom of religion or belief for all its citizens” and to “take further steps to ensure the promotion of the values of tolerance.” But authorities continued to prosecute writers and activists on charges of “contempt of religion” and “blasphemy,” including religious minorities and proclaimed atheists. In 2015, courts handed prison sentences to two men, who later went into hiding, for allegedly supporting atheism online. The same year also witnessed prosecutors in Beni Suef governorate ordering a local man arrested for allegedly posting cartoons online that insulted the prophet Mohamed.</p> <p>Egyptian Copts, who comprise roughly 10 percent of the population and are the largest Christian minority in the Middle East, have faced abuses and been targeted by extremist groups. Authorities failed to protect the Coptic community from sectarian violence and terrorist attacks. ISIS targeted Egyptian Christians on several occasions during the last few years killing scores of church-goers.</p> <p>The restrictive Law 80 of 2016 on the construction of churches allowed for legalizing scores of churches that were operating without an official permit, but restrictions remain largely in place and hundreds of churches without a permit lack legal protection. The rights group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) documented the closure by the authorities of 14 churches in 2018 alone.</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Cease harassment and persecution of members of religious minorities including atheists, Christian Copts, and Shia’ Muslims;</p> <p>Take steps to ensure the full and effective protection of the lives and property of religious minorities by holding accountable those responsible for attacks against religious minorities and investigating instances where security forces failed to respond to such attacks;</p> <p>Amend Law 80 of 2016 to remove restrictions on building and renovating churches and end discrimination against Christians.</p> <p>Gender-Based Discrimination and LGBT Rights</p> <p>Sexual harassment and violence against women remained endemic. Though Egypt accepted the 2014 UPR recommendation to take “measures to eliminate discrimination against women,” Egyptian women continued to face discrimination under Egypt’s personal status law on equal access to divorce, child custody, and inheritance. Egypt also accepted the 2014 UPR recommendation to adopt legislation to “criminalize all forms of violence against women,” yet no law was issued to combat domestic violence including to prevent abuse, protect survivors and prosecute abusers. Other forms of violence against women, including child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), continued in some areas, despite laws strengthening penalties against some of those crimes. However, in practice, authorities have prosecuted very few perpetrators despite how widespread such acts are.</p> <p>Egypt continues to prosecute scores of people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. At least 76 people were prosecuted under the “debauchery” law based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in 2018. Many are picked up by security officers on the streets, often solely on the basis of their gender-nonconforming appearance. In other cases, security officers entrap LGBT people through dating applications. The arrests in 2018 follow a wave of arrests in 2017, when, security forces arrested at least 75 gay and transgender people and activists after a few activists raised a rainbow flag, a sign of LGBT activism, at a concert in Cairo. Egypt routinely conducts forced anal examinations on people accused of homosexual conduct and, unlike other countries in the region, has taken no steps to ban these exams, which constitute a form of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment according to the UN Committee Against Torture. The government stopped authorizing sex reassignment surgeries for transgender people in 2016 and has provided no pathway to changing gender markers on official documents.</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Enact legislation to combat domestic violence and amend personal status laws that discriminate against women on issues of divorce, custody, and inheritance;</p> <p>Immediately put an end to the arrest and prosecution of people for their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity;</p> <p>End forced anal examinations of persons accused of consensual same-sex conduct and provide a rights-respecting pathway to legal gender recognition, through an administrative process based on self-identification;</p> <p>Actively prosecute perpetrators of FGM;</p> <p>Lift travel bans and asset freezes of women’s rights activists such as Mozn Hassan and Azza Solimon and allow women’s rights groups to operate independently and without harassment or fear of reprisal.</p> <p>Economic and Social Rights Abuses</p> <p>Authorities held in May 2018 the first trade union elections in Egypt in 12 years. However, while state officials claimed the elections were transparent and fair, results only reflected the former status quo, with the government-affiliated Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) emerging from the process effectively in control of the unions. The Center for Trade Union and Workers Services, the oldest independent labor rights group in Egypt, said that the elections were marred by violations such as the exclusion from the electoral process of hundreds of candidates not aligned with the government.</p> <p>The parliament passed a new trade union law in December 2017. However, in the view of trade unionists and labor activists, the law ""was only issued to win favor with the International Labor Organization,” and it kept in place several restrictions on the right to organize. Strikes remain criminalized in Egyptian law. Authorities arrested or charged at least 180 workers for peaceful workplace strikes and protests in 2016 and 2017, mostly over bonuses and delayed wages.</p> <p>Recommendations:</p>",4
942080412,Chronicle of Crimes Foretold: Delhi Riots' FIR 59/2020 and the 'Meerut Conspiracy’ Parable,2020-05-11 00:00:00,"<p>The investigating agencies inquiring into the Delhi riots have worked uncompromisingly through the coronavirus pandemic. I doubt officers have had any time for their families, let alone for parables. Here’s hoping they will indulge me, because I see in the Delhi Riots Conspiracy Case the police have come up with clear shades of the Meerut Conspiracy Case of 1929.</p> <p>It was a little more than 90 years ago that Viceroy Irwin – miffed with the relentless anti-imperialist agitations in India involving everyone from students, workers and peasants – tried to devise some way to cripple the nationalist Indian leadership and certain British socialists whom he was convinced were behind the protests. Secret communications flew thick and fast between the viceroy and the India Office in London, and a new law was proposed to give the government of India the power to remove any political organiser from British India, or even bar left-leaning Indians from travelling abroad so as not to expose them to further ideas.</p> <p>However, this proposed law, the ‘Public Safety Bill’, was defeated in the Indian legislative assembly in September 1928 because of the concerted efforts of nationalist members. During the assembly debates, Lala Lajpat Rai scoffed at the idea that the special law was necessitated by the presence of two British Communists who had been organising workers’ strikes in support of the freedom movement. It was absurd to suppose that a few men could be instrumental in bringing about such widespread expressions of dissent, he said. Srinivas Iyengar also opposed the Bill on the grounds that ‘no proof had been furnished that the British government was going to be destroyed or Indian society subverted [because of such hartals]. It was the will of a police officer, a district officer or a commercial magnate strong enough to press his view, which the governor-general-in-council accepted without enquiry’.</p> <p>In the aftermath of this defeat, which was seen as a nationalist victory, the colonial government announced it would reintroduce the Bill in the next session, and followed the announcement with an unyielding, single-minded campaign denouncing the ‘communist menace’ and propagating the idea that the defeat of the Bill was detrimental to the security of the state.</p> <p>Lord Irwin, for his part, sent another secret missive to the Secretary of State in Britain:</p> <p>“Although these movements are still in their infancy and may not be a serious menace in India for some little time, nevertheless they contain great potentialities of danger, and we are bound therefore to see what steps can be taken to discourage them while they are weak and prevent anything in the nature of rapid growth. We must consider what we can do in the way of preventing the Indian movement, which by itself is very weak, from receiving any impetus from outside either in the form of money or what is still more important, of brains and organizing capacity […] The Public Safety Bill as you have seen was defeated in the Assembly by the President’s casting vote and I have been carefully considering what lines we should take in the matter. We hope to run a conspiracy case against a considerable number of communists in India.’ [From Sir David Petrie and Sir Horace Williamson, Directors of Intelligence, Unpublished Papers, Edited by Saha, emphasis added]</p> <p>The conspiracy case was run indeed, for four-and-a-half long years. Jurist and constitutional expert A.G. Noorani says that uniquely amongst political trials even, the stated objective of the ‘Meerut Conspiracy Case’ was not to secure the conviction of the 32 accused, but rather to crush the imminent Civil Disobedience Movement. ‘The accused were to be punished for the beliefs they held; not for any illegal act they had committed.’</p> <p>The Public Safety Bill was to be reintroduced in the assembly on March 21, 1929. On the evening of March 20, raids were conducted in Bombay, Calcutta, Allahabad, Delhi, Lahore and other places: in houses, trade unions and at newspaper offices. Thirty-two people, members of the AICC and AITUC, the Workers’ and Peasants’ Party, were arrested and tried in Meerut. Although only two of the 32 arrested were from Meerut, it was chosen as the seat of trial by the prosecution in order to deny the benefit of a jury trial to the accused.</p> <p>The end result, however, was far from satisfactory for the colonial authorities.</p> <p>Delhi riots and FIR 59/2020</p> <p>Ninety kilometres and 91 years separate Meerut and Delhi and the two conspiracy cases but it is hard not to miss the similarity between the political impulse behind both.</p> <p>FIR 59/2020 was filed at the instance of a sub-Inspector, and on the basis of information received from an unnamed police informer. It states that the Delhi riots were planned by certain persons, who used the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests as an opportunity to mobilise the masses against the government of the day. Specifically, it alleges that speeches were given that encouraged people to protest in the streets during US President Donald Trump’s Delhi visit, with the aim to internationally further the ‘propaganda’ that minorities were being oppressed in India.</p> <p>Normally, FIRs refrain from making political statements. Sometimes, they reproduce the offending speech, verbatim, but it is unusual for an FIR to denounce a political assertion as ‘propaganda’. Whether minorities are in fact being oppressed in India is a political question, or, in specific cases, a judicial one, so it is certainly odd that the FIR pronounces it propaganda and delegitimises the entire protest at the very outset.</p> <p>The FIR does not mention any invocation to violence in the speeches. Yet, remarkably, it invokes Sections 147 [rioting], 148 [rioting armed with deadly weapons], 149 [being a member of a common assembly and acting in common object] and 120 B [criminal conspiracy], thus treating all anti-CAA protestors (and all protests across India) as a single collective rioting agent, while never once explicitly alleging that the protestors rioted.</p> <p>Also Read: Delhi Riots 2020: There Was a Conspiracy, But Not the One the Police Alleges</p> <p>There is a single reference to information being received that certain homes in northeast Delhi had stored firearms, petrol bombs, acid and stones, but there is no obvious connection of these homes with the protest. Even if the allegation were that some of these homeowners had attended the protests, it is not clear why their individual culpabilities in their homes would turn the entire protest into a rioting collective.</p> <p>Derren Brown is a fascinating ‘mentalist’, or illusionist: he can manipulate any audience into thinking in a particular way. He says he does it by subtly and repeatedly inserting an idea into their heads. Thus, if at the beginning of a show he refers to someone as a ‘troublemaker’, and casually continues to do so during his act, he can get his audience to react to that person in a particular way by the end of the show.</p> <p>FIR 59/2020 turns the protestors into rioters in peoples’ minds, without alleging any instance of collective violence by the assembly. The fact of the assembly itself is treated as an offence.</p> <p>The FIR records that women and children deliberately blocked the road outside the Jaffrabad metro station, inconveniencing others and adding to the tense atmosphere, such that riots broke out. It is silent on who was apparently so provoked by the protestors that they felt that violent action to clear them out was justified. It does not attribute any violence to the protestors at Jaffrabad, but it implies that blocking the road and inconveniencing others was ‘violence’ in itself, which led to retaliatory action by others.</p> <p>There was a time when the familiar trope for orchestrating a riot was slaughtering a pig and throwing it outside a mosque; or leaving a bag of meat in a temple; or pelting stones at a religious place or a religious gathering. Each of these actions, deliberate attempts to provoke communal violence, were offences in themselves.</p> <p>FIR 59/2020 has successfully changed that trope by equating the anti-CAA protests with such provocation, proclaiming the protestors collectively as rioters, and suggesting that minority dissent to an idea that has popular support otherwise is in itself, a provocative act, and good reason for the outbreak of riots. In its silence on those who actually retaliated violently to the protests, it treats them as automated bots responding to ‘protest provocation’, and seems to find no reason to go into their individual and active roles.</p> <p>The FIR also doesn’t look at the ‘charged circumstances’ as a gradual build-up: what accentuating circumstances turned the protests into a hateful thing for non-participants? It is not common in our country for any section of people to feel provoked by any other group – or indeed by the government – for merely having been ‘inconvenienced’. What was the role of certain leaders, or that of the media, in turning the protestors into monsters? What were the omissions, if any, on the part of the administration and the police? FIR 59 rather treats the fact of the protests as an apriori reason for retaliatory violence.</p> <p>Be that as it may, it is altogether possible for any peaceful protest to become disorderly at any given moment, due to extraneous circumstances, or from a generally charged atmosphere.</p> <p>Also Read: Delhi Police Affidavit Shows Muslims Bore Brunt of Riots, Silent on Who Targeted Them and Why</p> <p>While the constitution of India guarantees the right to assemble peacefully under Article 19(1)(b), this right is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India and of public order. If a public assembly has the potential of becoming unruly, or causing others to become unruly, the police have the responsibility to disperse it using minimal and proportionate force.</p> <p>Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code says that an assembly may be designated an ‘unlawful assembly’ if it commits any criminal trespass, or any other offence, or if it deprives any person of the right of way, etc. An assembly that was not previously lawful may be designated ‘unlawful’ with changing circumstances.</p> <p>Upon such designation, if a breach of peace seems imminent, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Police Manuals describe a detailed code of conduct, which includes involving officers of the administration to persuade the protestors to disperse, followed by warning, and then application of minimal and proportionate force [Sections 129 and 130 of the CrPC The police also have the right to detain members of the unlawful assembly during the process of dispersal, or to preventively detain its leaders].</p> <p>Post-facto prosecutions are possible, too: Sections 142 to 145 of the Indian Penal Code describe offences that range from knowingly being a member of an unlawful assembly, to being present in an unlawful assembly while armed with a deadly weapon, which, when used ‘as a weapon of offence’, is likely to cause death. All these offences are cognizable and bailable.</p> <p>‘Deep-rooted conspiracy’</p> <p>FIR 59 does not frame the alleged unruliness in terms of applicable law, which assesses the unlawfulness of an assembly ‘in the moment’. It frames it in terms of ‘a deep-rooted conspiracy’: of political action that opposed the CAA, and was implicitly ‘seditious’ and provocative, and which must, therefore, be the focus of all investigations relating to the riots.</p> <p>There have been several arrests, some even under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), mostly of students and activists involved in the protest. Many others have been summoned, amongst them writers and teachers, art workers and filmmakers, people who are otherwise called ‘intellectuals’, purveyors of new ideas.</p> <p>In investigating the intellectuals, the police are really investigating their ideas. ‘Why do you oppose the citizen amendment act? Why do you support street protests that inconvenience people? Why were you actively mobilizing people in support? What do you want so much ‘azadi’ for? You people have been allowed too much freedom in the past.’</p> <p>It is not unknown for the police to question political ideas; however, the ‘midnight knock’ is associated with authoritarian regimes. In India, on the other hand, the constitution has allowed for loud political dissent. Even protests that embarrass the government of the day have ordinarily not been subject to investigative scrutiny under special acts.</p> <p>Mobilising support for a political idea is a democratic process, even when it seeks to rupture or dislodge a prevailing discourse. In my experience, I’ve seen the Babri masjid-Ramjanambhoomi movement redefine Indian selfhood, significantly rupturing previously held notions. Politically, and peacefully, it is not illegal to mobilise even to make the polity ‘mukt’ from a certain party or ideology (although to make it ‘mukt’ of a people would amount to hate speech/ genocide). It is not a ‘shadowy conspiracy’ to suggest that the government of the day is apathetic to a section of the population. Those claims have often been made: most forcefully, in fact, by the ruling party in its assertion that the incumbents practised appeasement and neglected the majority.</p> <p>The contours of a penal offence, as different from dissenting politics, are very well defined. Demonstrations and street protests are not in themselves seditious or dangerous. If they block traffic, they may be dealt with under applicable sections of the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes. What is indeed an offence is a direct call to violence at such a demonstration and a causal and immediate link between the speech and actual violence.</p> <p>The Tilak sedition trial</p> <p>FIR 59 has, in fact, moved the clock even further back than 1929, to Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s sedition trial of 1897. In Tilak’s trial, the presiding judge, Justice Strachey, expanded the meaning of sedition, from violently inciting people against the government, to include general lack of affection for it. Thus any show of bitterness, or suspicion, or any speech or writing that might encourage others to like the government any less was termed seditious. Tilak was sent to jail for writing against the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, promulgated during the Bombay plague, which gave the British administration wide regulatory powers over the local population.</p> <p>Also Read: How Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s 1897 Trial Marked the Criminalisation of Dissent</p> <p>The post-independence Indian Supreme Court, on the other hand, categorically rejects that forceful discursive criticisms of the government and its policies are bases for sedition. It has employed the ‘spark in the powder keg’ test, which denotes speech or action that is as immediately incendiary as a lit fuse (chanting ‘goli maro…’ in close proximity to, and with reference to a group of people; and if soon thereafter somebody actually fires on a representative sections of that group, for instance). FIR 59 on the other hand, implies an ‘embers in the wind’ theory: it criminalises sustained criticism of the government, ostensibly on grounds that this has the potential to cause disaffection. Unfortunately, the claim has no basis in law.</p> <p>In its construction of the anti-CAA protests, FIR 59 is not neutral. It takes the position that these political protests were based on misrepresentations, were anti-state and treacherous. By doing so, it criminalises arguments around minority rights and against the CAA; it makes suspect any kind of protest against the government, and it normalises the humiliation of scores of teachers and students when they are summoned to police stations and interrogated for their participation in the protests. FIR 59 makes believable even the most absurd, uncorroborated allegations about the grave ‘conspiracy’ of the protests, and thus equally acceptable that the police should take several extensions on the submission of the chargesheet – the substantiation of the allegations in the FIR – while accused wait in jail.</p> <p>Back to the future</p> <p>To come back to the Meerut Conspiracy Case, the investigations produced 25 printed, folio-sized volumes of documentary evidence. Three thousand five hundred prosecution exhibits and about 320 witnesses from across Britain and India sought to prove the political activities of the accused and their associations with each other. It was officially announced at the end of the trial that the process had cost 126,000 pounds.</p> <p>However, at the end of proceedings in 1933, the high court let off the accused with minimal sentences. It also so happened that over the four-and-half-years, the proceedings attracted a lot of sympathetic interest in the political issues at hand, both in India and abroad. There was an outcry in the British press and parliament: the conservative government even lost the general election of May 1929. Neither was the anti-colonial political movement seriously affected, apparently because it had mass appeal, beyond its few organisers who had been arrested.</p> <p>It has been said that the process left Lord Irwin and also the Secretary of State quite ‘disillusioned’. The Lord wrote to the Secretary ‘that he wished to heaven he had not embarked on the Meerut Trial’, and the Secretary of State confided that he would be ‘devoutly thankful when the whole thing is over and done with.’ Lord Irwin’s successor, Viceroy Willingdon declared summarily that he would ‘pretty well assure that there were no more of the terrible conspiracy cases while he was Viceroy’.</p> <p>As the Delhi conspiracy cases drag on, will their architects similarly wish they never went down this path?</p> <p>Shahrukh Alam is a lawyer practising in New Delhi</p>",4

Scores of human rights activists, journalists, bloggers, religious figures and union campaigners have been brutally attacked or imprisoned under the country's draconian penal code for peacefully expressing their views.</p> <p>In several cases, people have been convicted for nothing more than posting materials on Facebook.</p> <p>The EU has repeatedly highlighted this negative trend, including just a few weeks before the negotiations concluded.</p> <p>The worsening human rights record has led many in the European parliament to voice concerns. In September 2018, 32 MEPs sent a letter calling for concrete human rights improvements in Vietnam before any parliament vote on the deals.</p> <p>Concerns were raised again in October 2018 during a hearing with Vietnamese authorities, and reiterated a month later in an urgent resolution.</p> <p>Regrettably, the government's crackdown has continued, with the adoption of a problematic cybersecurity law last January and new waves of arrests of perceived critics.</p> <p>Vietnam also rejected the EU member states' recommendations during its latest scrutiny at the UN to amend or repeal abusive legislation and to release political prisoners.</p> <p>In June, a group of MEPs sent a letter asking again for concrete human rights improvements to serve as benchmarks for the parliament's upcoming consent procedure.</p> <p>The parliament's foreign affairs committee expressed the same position a few months later in a non-binding opinion, mirroring a recent call by international and Vietnamese groups, including Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>Notably, Pham Chi Dung, one of the signatories of that appeal, and author of a parallel petition, was arrested on November 22, most likely for his outreach to MEPs. The arrest sparked outrage in parliament, which led to a letter by president David Sassoli raising his case.</p> <p>The Vietnamese ambassador's reply, seen by Human Rights Watch, plainly defends the arrest and shamelessly compares Vietnam's limitations to freedom of expression to those in place in western countries.</p> <p>In December, MEP Jan Zahradil, stepped down from his long-standing rapporteur role for the trade deals following allegations of institutional links with the Vietnamese Communist Party.</p> <p>The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) then joined the choir of voices urging the postponement of the consent until Vietnam achieves clear human rights benchmarks, concurring in the assessment that its penal code stands in the way of labour freedoms, regardless of the recent labour law reform.</p> <p>In an attempt to address some of these concerns, some trade committee members asked for a binding roadmap on the (long overdue) ratification of the core labour rights conventions, unconvinced by the Vietnamese government's self-imposed, non-binding and un-enforceable deadline of 2023.</p> <p>The committee members also timidly raised some wider human rights concerns, and called for bringing the penal legislation ""in line and in coherence with ILO (International Labour Organisation) conventions"".</p> <p>On January 6, prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc replied, claiming airily that ""it is a consistent policy of the government of Vietnam to protect and promote human rights,"" and failing to address the MEPs' most controversial proposals, including reform of the penal code.</p> <p>So where are we now?</p> <p>Unless there is a change in the schedule, on Tuesday (21 January) the trade committee has to adopt its final position on the deals, which would then face a final vote in plenary in early February.</p> <p>Trade MEPs are in a rather difficult position.</p> <p>A majority in the committee could grant immediate consent to the deals. But a growing number of MEPs have become aware of the brutality and unreliability of the Vietnamese regime, and realise that this vote is one of the rare occasions in which they have binding power in EU foreign policy – and that they can and want to use this authority to secure concrete human rights improvements in Vietnam.</p> <p>Many have manifested strong discomfort with the continued detention of Pham Chi Dung, and there is a widespread feeling that granting consent when the Vietnamese government has met none of the human rights requests put forward by MEPs would seriously undermine the credibility of the parliament.</p> <p>It would also risk exacerbating internal divisions within political groups and among different committees that could lead to a negative vote in February.</p> <p>Instead of choosing whether to compromise the deals or their own principles and credibility, in the coming weeks MEPs have an opportunity to form a common front and set some concrete, achievable and strategic human rights benchmarks, and agree to green light the deals only once Vietnam meets them.</p> <p>If one had to mention only two of them, they could be: a serious commitment to reform the penal legislation, and the release of political prisoners, starting with Pham Chi Dung and others whose health is at risk.</p> <p>To simply vote to consent, without getting anything from the Vietnamese government, is to waste an unprecedented opportunity for positive change in the country.</p>",4
958911020,Bayan Muna condemns arrests on Human Rights Day,2020-12-10 21:49:29,"<p>MANILA, Philippines — Party-list group Bayan Muna deplored the arrest of seven human rights defenders as the world commemorates the International Human Rights Day itself on Thursday, saying that it is a testament to how the administration treats activists.</p> <p>According to Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate, the Philippine National Police (PNP) would like to paint the arrests as part of its continuous crackdown on loose firearms. Still, he claimed that it is just another way of stifling legitimate dissent.</p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> <p>Reports from PNP’s Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) showed that seven individuals were arrested in various operations in Quezon City, Manila, and Mandaluyong City — one of the suspects included journalist and Manila Today editor Lady Ann Salem.</p> <p>“This is how the Duterte administration commemorates Human Rights Day by violating more human rights and arresting human rights defenders,” Zarate said in a statement.</p> <p>“In the guise of going after gangs and loose guns, the [CIDG] targeted and arrested seven human rights defenders namely: Dennise Velasco, Mark Ryan Cruz, Romina Astudillo, Jaymie Gregorio Jr., Rodrigo Esparago, Joel Demate, who are trade unionists; and, Lady Ann Salem, a journalist and editor of Manila Today, an online media outlet that was also red-tagged recently,” he added.</p> <p>All the suspects should be released immediately, Zarate said.</p> <p>CIDG said that they served five search warrants as part of their intensified campaign against loose firearms and gangs, starting at around 2:00 a.m. on Thursday.</p> <p>However, the Makabayan lawmaker alleged that the style of arrests largely mimics its tactics in raiding various activists’ offices in Metro Manila and Negros Island last November 2019 — the same series of arrests that landed Reina Mae Nasino in jail. He claimed that the evidence seized was merely planted.</p> <p>He also noted that the same judge — Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 89 Judge Cecilyn E. Burgos-Villavert — issued the search warrants in the 2019 arrests and the recent operations.</p> <p>Bayan Muna questioned in 2019 why then National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief Gen.

993534392,"Charge Security Branch officers with activist's death,...",2021-07-05 00:00:00,"<p>The last words in the reopened inquest into the death of Neil Aggett were finally said and done when closing arguments wrapped up on Friday, 2 July.</p> <p>It’s a milestone, marking the inching forward of the court processes that started in January 2020 with the intention to set the record straight surrounding Aggett’s death in detention in 1982; to determine consequences and culpability nearly 40 years later; and to offer some form of justice, maybe some closure, too, for Aggett’s family and friends.</p> <p>In his summing up, Advocate Howard Varney, acting for the Aggett family, stressed the family’s continued assertion that Aggett, a 28-year-old doctor and trade union organiser at the time, was murdered after being detained by Security Branch police in November 1981. Aggett did not commit suicide, there was foul play and his death by hanging in the John Vorster Square police cells came about as a result of the “direct acts” of Security Branch officers, Varney said.</p> <p>He added that should the court find that Aggett died by suicide, it had to be induced suicide arising from Aggett’s prolonged detention of 70 days and sustained assault, torture and trauma inflicted on him in during the weeks, days and hours leading up to his death on 5 February 1982.</p> <p>Both Varney and the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA’s) Advocate Jabulani Mlotshwa argued that the forensic testimony presented in the reopened inquest pointed to a conclusion that Aggett could not have climbed his cell bars in the second floor of the John Vorster Square police station to hang himself. More likely, they maintained, is that evidence presented suggested that Aggett’s hanging was staged after he was rendered into a state of unconsciousness or low consciousness.</p> <p>Along with this forensic testimony, Mlotshwa argued that had Aggett committed suicide, his chief interrogator, Lieutenant Steven Whitehead, and Sergeant Paul Erasmus (who testified in 2020) would not have gone to the extraordinary lengths they did – including at one point gaining illegal entry into Aggett’s parents’ home – to try to find “evidence” that Aggett had suicidal tendencies.</p> <p>Whitehead died in April 2019, just days before the NPA announced the inquest would be reopened. This followed years of inaction from the NPA around reopening the inquest into Aggett’s death, which was among about 300 cases involving deaths and disappearances of anti-apartheid activists that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission had recommend for further investigation in 2003.</p> <p>Whitehead, dead at 62, reportedly from cancer, went to his grave without having to answer in a courtroom. Over the past 18 months though, he has been cast by his former colleagues as an upstart, willing to bend the rules to climb the ranks and to prove himself in the Security Branch. He was described as a party animal, a boozer and a daddy’s boy and was regarded as untouchable, being on the receiving end of privilege and protection through nepotism.</p> <p>Mlotshwa also said Whitehead had a fixation with Aggett, a blinding obsession almost, that made his cruelty towards the young doctor explicit, although evidence presented to the court showed that Aggett was not involved with a banned organisation or any underground organisation – he was interested in fighting for workers’ rights, which wasn’t an illegal activity.</p> <p>But Whitehead and others ensured his torture in detention included electric shocks, beatings, sleep deprivation and physical and verbal abuse over an extended period – hallmarks of his interrogation and efforts to extract a confession from Aggett.</p> <p>The court also heard that Whitehead and the head of the Security Branch at the time, Major Arthur Conwright, were likely out to prove that they were close to piecing together a case that would be as explosive as “the next Treason Trial”. It would be a significant breakthrough to quash an uprising against the National Party regime.</p> <p>Whitehead and Conwright, both now dead, left it to their colleagues that could be tracked down over the past few years to take the stand in the reopened inquest.</p> <p>Testimony these former cops gave over the past 18 months was almost uniformly marked by a refusal to divulge specifics, a defence of foggy memories lost to the passing decades, or a portrayal of close and cosy relationships with detainees who were well cared for. They said if torture or abuse had occurred they never heard or saw it happen and they never took part in any acts of torture or violence themselves.</p> <p>They also gave testimony of oaths of silence among the Security Branch members and acknowledged that members were an inner sanctum within the police and operated with their own codes and culture. Testimony was given that this routinely included the likes of cover-ups, falsifying registers and documentation, rigging identity parades and “not splitting on each other”.</p> <p>Mlotshwa and Varney, in their separate closing statements, called these witnesses “unreliable”, “brazen liars” and “conspirators in cover-ups and suppression”.</p> <p>Varney’s recommendation to the court was that the findings in the original inquest, that Aggett died by suicide and that no one could be held responsible for his death, be overturned.</p> <p>“It is a ruling that is deeply hurtful and an affront to Neil Aggett’s family and friends. It remains a stain on history and the Security Branch officers must be held to account,” he said.</p> <p>Varney asked the court to recommend that in addition to a charge of perjury that Nicolaas Deetlefs also be charged for Aggett’s murder. This Varney said is based on Deetlefs’s evidence that he considered Aggett a suicide risk but even so failed to notify the officer in charge of detainees or to report his concerns about Aggett’s wellbeing to anyone who could have put in safeguards to protect him from self-harm.</p> <p>“He was acutely aware of what Conwright and Whitehead were doing and had a heightened legal duty to act, but he didn’t,” Varney said.</p> <p>Varney also called for the courts to ensure that Security Branch officers Joseph Petrus Woensdregt, Daniel Elhardhus Swanepoel, Roelof Venter and Eddie Chauke be made to “face consequences for their brazen lies” to the court.</p> <p>In his closing arguments, Advocate Stephanus Coetzee, acting for Martin Naude, Venter and Deetlefs, centred on Whitehead as “the main person” involved with Aggett’s interrogations, not his clients. He said officers like Naude and Deetlefs were only pulled into Aggett’s interrogation as stand-ins and for short periods. Deetlefs, he said, spent just nine hours with Aggett and Venter had no direct interaction with the activist.</p> <p>Coetzee and Advocate Ashika Ramlaal, acting on behalf of Woensdregt, Johannes Visser and Swanepoel, maintained that the clue to knowing what led to Aggett’s death comes down to the 15 hours before it occurred. It was at this time that Aggett made a complaint about a particularly severe interrogation he had suffered on 4 January 1982. He named Whitehead as well as a Sergeant James van Schalkwyk as the men who tortured him, as Chauke watched.</p> <p>Coetzee said Aggett was at the point of filing the complaint “not under duress” and had “regained enough self-confidence to confront his abusers”. It demonstrated, Coetzee argued, that what came before the filing of the complaint could have no bearing on what caused Aggett’s death 15 hours later. Ramlaal also made this submission.</p> <p>Coetzee also said Deetlefs would not have been able to report Aggett as a suicide risk because of “hierarchies of power and line functions” in police reporting protocol. He also argued that Deetlefs had not misled the court even when he repeatedly said he couldn’t remember specifics. Coetzee said it would have been more suspicious had Deetlefs remembered every detail after nearly 40 years.</p> <p>“At best the court can come to a probable finding but there is no evidence of direct murder,” Coetzee said.</p> <p>Judgment is reserved.</p>",4
962097571,A spending-led economic recovery will soon rely on robust wage growth,2020-12-29 00:00:00,"<p>In his genial and occasionally subversive manner, finance journalist Alan Kohler recently shared a graph on social media that compared two periods of sharemarket gains. The graph showed that in the 30 years to 1988, 92 per cent of gains were derived from economic growth. But in the decades since then, the majority of sharemarket growth was produced by a “transfer from wages”. In simple terms, businesses have been making money by taking more of the economic pie from their workers rather than growing it.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has, if anything, exacerbated the trend with company profits jumping while workers’ total share of income has continued its steep decline.</p> <p>The process of suppressing wage growth in Australia began 40 years ago at a unique time in our history. In 1982, for example, wages for full-time employees grew by 14.2 per cent. Inflation and unemployment also spiralled into double figures. Attempts to moderate wage growth and inflation failed until the election of the Hawke government in 1983. The new government recognised that the key to suppressing wage growth was reducing employee bargaining power by changing workplace laws and obtaining the agreement of the trade unions to reduce wage demands. The Accord and new workplace laws enshrining enterprise bargaining were born.</p> <p>Illustration: Dionne Gain Credit:</p> <p>In the decades since, numerous waves of “IR reform” have continued along the same trajectory; allowing businesses to escape bargaining with their employees and weakening unions. In most private-sector workplaces, bargaining has been eliminated and replaced by managerial decree, usually in the form of a take-it-or-leave-it employment contract. The imbalance in power is now so entrenched that wages have stagnated for the last eight years and the RBA forecasts more wage stagnation in years to come.</p>",4
939965973,Ramaphosa envoys snubs opposition and civic groups,2020-08-10 18:28:38,"<p>HARARE -President Emmerson Mnangagwa risked a diplomatic spat with South Africa on Monday after blocking two special envoys sent by President Cyril Ramaphosa to gather information on human rights violations in Zimbabwe from meeting his rivals and rights groups.</p> <p>Mnangagwa met the three-team delegation of Baleka Mbethe, Sydney Mafamadi and Ngoako Ramatlhodi at State House during which he reportedly told them there was “no crisis in Zimbabwe.”</p> <p>The main opposition MDC Alliance said Ramaphosa’s office contacted them last Saturday to prepare a five-person delegation to meet his envoys on Monday. In a statement announcing the Zimbabwe mission last week, Ramaphosa had said the delegation would “engage the government of Zimbabwe and relevant stakeholders to identify possible ways in which South Africa can assist Zimbabwe.”</p> <p>The latest diplomatic activity follows a crackdown by security services which has seen striking nurses, journalists, opposition leaders and trade union leaders being arrested or abducted and tortured accused of plots to oust Mnangagwa’s regime.</p> <p>The MDC says at least 30 of its members have gone into hiding after an intensification of raids on the homes of Mnangagwa’s rivals in the lead up to planned anti-government protests on July 31 which were crushed by the military and police.</p> <p>“We can only assume the failure to meet the MDC Alliance delegation was a result of demands made by the Zanu PF delegation,” MDC Alliance spokesperson Fadzayi Mahere said in a statement.</p> <p>“We reiterate that Zimbabwe is in a state of crisis that has been characterised by a de facto state of emergency, a crackdown on citizens, abductions, arbitrary arrests of government critics and persecution of journalists.</p> <p>“The government in Harare is incapable of resolving these challenges because it lacks legitimacy.”</p> <p>ZimLive understands at the end of the State House meeting, South Africa’s ambassador to Zimbabwe Mphakama Mbete – a brother to special envoy Baleka Mbete – called MDC Alliance officials and said the delegation would not be meeting them as they were returning to South Africa to brief Ramaphosa on the outcome of their meeting with Mnangagwa.</p> <p>“It appears there was a stand-off at State House. The regime doesn’t want its propaganda of ‘no crisis in Zimbabwe’ contaminated with the truth of its brutal crackdown against citizens,” a senior MDC Alliance official said.</p> <p>South Africa’s main opposition parties the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters have leaned on President Ramaphosa to step in and resolve the Zimbabwe crisis. The EFF has threatened to force the closure of Zimbabwe’s embassy in Pretoria and also the border with Zimbabwe at Beitbridge until Mnangagwa makes concessions about respecting human rights.</p> <p>United Nations Secretary General António Guterres last week said he was following developments in Zimbabwe with “concern”.</p> <p>“He urges the government of Zimbabwe to ensure the protection of all fundamental human rights, notably the freedom of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association,” said a statement from Guterres’ office.</p> <p>African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat has issued a rare rebuke of a member state after expressing concern at reports of the use of “disproportionate force” by Zimbabwe’s security forces in enforcing Covid-19 emergency measures.</p> <p>“The chairperson is concerned about reports of disproportionate use of force by security forces in enforcing Covid-19 emergency measures. He implores the authorities to exercise restraint in their response to peaceful protests,” Mahamat’s office said.</p> <p>During a Heroes’ Day address to the nation before his meeting with the envoys, Mnangagwa called criticism of human rights abuses by his government “divisive falsehoods” and said his administration was under renewed attack from domestic and foreign opponents.</p> <p>“The divisive falsehoods and concoctions by renegades and supremacists who want to pounce on our natural resources will never win the day. Truth shall triumph over lies, and good over evil,” said Mnangagwa, who replaced Robert Mugabe after a 2017 coup.</p> <p>Share this: Twitter</p> <p>Facebook</p>",4

Long live May Day.” There are often detentions during the annual May 1 workers’ holiday.</p> <p>Taksim has been a flashpoint on May Day with frequent clashes since 34 people were killed there on May 1, 1977. A small group led by the Confederation of Turkish Revolutionary Trade Unions attended an officially approved event at Taksim Square.</p> <p>A usually bustling square lined with cafes and hotels, Taksim was also the epicentre of 2013 anti-government protests. Protests initially erupted over an attempt to save adjacent Gezi park from demolition at the hands of the government but grew into a broader movement against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was then prime minister.</p> <p>Critics accuse Erdogan of amassing great power, trampling on human rights and quashing dissent.

883425020,On Journalists Who Refuse To Defend Dissident Journalists,2019-10-31 00:00:00,"<p>Article – Caitlin Johnstone</p> <p>Mainstream Journalists Who Refuse To Defend Dissident Journalists Are Worshippers Of PowerAlternative media circles have been buzzing for the last two days ever since news broke about the arrest of Grayzone journalist Max Blumenthal, who was reportedly jailed for two days after a SWAT-style police team showed up threatening to break his door down last Friday.</p> <p>Blumenthal is charged with simple assault alleged to have taken place five months ago during the notorious standoff when the US government was working to remove the official Venezuelan government from its DC embassy and replace it with diplomats from the Guaido-led puppet government it was attempting to force into power. Dissident journalists, including Blumenthal, stationed themselves in the embassy in opposition to the illegal eviction and to document the behavior of the evictors. Blumenthal calls the assault charge “a 100 percent false, fabricated, bogus, untrue, and malicious lie.”</p> <p>I watched the news of the embassy standoff with much interest, largely because the obnoxious, oafish behavior of the anti-Maduro counter-protesters on the scene were a perfect reflection of the obnoxious, oafish behavior I’d experienced from anti-Maduro accounts online. I’ve argued with every major political faction in America at one point or another, and some of them can be downright vile, but I’ve never run into such an intellectually dishonest, crude, nasty group of people in my three years on this job as those who’ve been cheering on the Trump administration’s regime change agenda in Venezuela. There’s not a doubt in my mind that someone from this unscrupulous, shady group would be capable of making false allegations against a dissident journalist who disagreed with them.</p> <p>“According to an individual familiar with the case, the warrant for Blumenthal’s arrest was initially rejected,” Grayzone reports. “Strangely, this false charge was revived months later without the defendant’s knowledge.”</p> <p>Strangely indeed.</p> <p>I was arrested on Friday on a COMPLETELY FALSE charge manufactured by the Venezuelan opposition related to their siege of the embassy in DC. I spent 2 days in jail, was shackled for extended periods & was denied my right to call a lawyer. Here’s the facts: https://t.co/2Nco0OzQ7P</p> <p>— Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) October 28, 2019</p> <p>Strange as it is, alternative media figures are the only people talking about an opposition journalist being arrested on highly suspicious grounds in a highly suspicious way. Mainstream media reporters have been completely ignoring this story.</p> <p>“Arrest and caging of opposition US journalist Max Blumenthal reminds me (and others I know) of the worst of Russia,” tweeted journalist Mark Ames. “Except there, when oppo journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested, most big-name Russian journalists—including Putin-friendly—publicly supported Golunov. Here—silence.”</p> <p>This silence is unsurprising at this point, because this same media class has for years been either mute or vocally favorable on the persecution of another dissident journalist, Julian Assange. Ambitious young journalists are made well aware that the very easiest way to demonstrate your loyalty to the media-owning plutocratic establishment is to participate in the relentless smear campaign against the WikiLeaks founder which has worked its way into virtually all political sectors of the western world, and the very easiest way to lose standing within the plutocratic media is to defend him.</p> <p>There’s a popular quote that a German pastor wrote after the second World War that goes,</p> <p>“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—</p> <p>Because I was not a socialist.</p> <p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—</p> <p>Because I was not a trade unionist.</p> <p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—</p> <p>Because I was not a Jew.</p> <p>Then they came for me—</p> <p>and there was no one left to speak for me.”</p> <p>It’s a good quote, and, understandably, people have been invoking it for the steadily escalating war on oppositional journalism we’ve been witnessing throughout the western empire. Cries of “First they came for Assange” and “First they came for the journalists” are common in circles which value the existence of a free press which is capable of holding power to account, the argument being that if you let them come for journalists like Assange and Blumenthal, it’s only a matter of time before they come for you, too.</p> <p>Only one problem: it isn’t true.</p> <p>Arrest & caging of opposition US journalist @MaxBlumenthal reminds me (and others I know) of the worst of Russia. Except there, when oppo journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested, most big-name Russian journalists—including Putin-friendly—publicly supported Golunov.</p> <p>Here—silence.</p> <p>— Mark Ames (@MarkAmesExiled) October 29, 2019</p> <p>It isn’t true that if you allow authority to come after dissident journalists they’ll necessarily end up coming after you. That’s only true if you intend at some point to publish something that those in power don’t want you to publish. If you’ve closed the door to the possibility of your ever doing that, then you know that there is no risk to you, so there’s no need to defend dissident journalists when their reporting sees them targeted for legal persecution by the powerful. Which is exactly what mainstream reporters who fail to defend Assange and Blumenthal are telling us about themselves: they’ve closed that door and chosen the side of power, come what may.</p> <p>This is where the silence comes from. It isn’t that those who work in mainstream news media lack an understanding that at some point power structures may shift and you’ll want to report facts that are inconvenient for the powerful without fear of imprisonment; these people all watched Donald Trump get elected. They already know that things can take a very dark turn in the future for where power is located, and they’ve already decided they don’t care and will always side with the powerful going forward. If the election of Donald Trump wasn’t enough to show these people that it’s a good idea to make sure the press can continue to hold power to account in the future, then nothing will. They’re not ignorant, they’re subservient. They’ve made a lifelong commitment to continue to worship at the altar of power.</p> <p>If we were to re-write the “First they came” poem to describe the current war on dissident journalism we’re seeing in 2019, it would go more like this:</p> <p>First they came for Assange, and I did not speak out—</p> <p>Because I was a mainstream western journalist with no intention of ever usetting the powerful.</p> <p>Then they came for Blumental, and I did not speak out—</p> <p>Because I was a mainstream western journalist with no intention of ever usetting the powerful.</p> <p>Then they came for all the other dissident journalists, and I did not speak out—</p> <p>Because I will never be a dissident journalist.</p> <p>They never came for me—</p> <p>Because I have chosen to serve power.</p> <p>______________________________</p> <p>Thanks for reading!

1002703867,Why Celebrate Labor Day,2021-09-06 00:00:00,"<p>There is much confusion over why the United States of America and Canada commemorate Labor Day on the first Monday in September and not as many other nations do, on the first of May.</p> <p>For some workers unaware of the history, Labor Day is perceived as a tactic to counteract the militant international working-class spirit of May Day and becoming a symbol of workers’ docility, of collaboration with the bosses, of everything that weakens. It is a day associated with BBQs, picnics and shopping at the mall. However, Labor Day is a celebration of America’s and Canada’s labor movement. That’s easy to forget these days.</p> <p>Labor Day took its inspiration from a strike for the 8 hour day held in Toronto in the 1870s and was adopted by American workers, four years before the momentous events of 1886 that initiated May Day. So both Labor Day and May Day share common origins in the campaign for “8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest and 8 hours for what we will” as the song went.</p> <p>So both Mayday and Labor Day should be reminders of the need for working people to try and capture the good things in life and advance working peoples’ well-being. Labor Day also came about because workers felt they were spending too many hours and days on the job. In the 1830s, manufacturing workers were putting in 70-hour weeks on average. Sixty years later, in 1890, hours of work had dropped, although the average manufacturing worker still toiled in a factory 60 hours a week. These long working hours caused many union organizers to focus on winning a shorter eight-hour workday. They also focused on getting workers more days off, such as the Labor Day holiday, and reducing the working week to just six days. Labor unions are still finding ways to wield their organizing influence and help fellow workers.</p> <p>The World Socialist Movement tries to explain the lessons of the first Mayday and Labor Day is that the capitalists need us, we do not need them. “Labor creates all wealth, All wealth belongs to labor”. Our fellow workers need to learn and understand the truth of that statement.</p> <p>In capitalism, the rich always grow richer and all workers can do within capitalism is slow that process down. What is needed is the entire edifice, the whole system – wages, profits, markets requires abolishing and only then can we make decisions to free ourselves and the world.</p> <p>Canadians will, of course, be fully aware that their Labor Day origins can be traced back to an 1872 printers strike in Toronto when a parade was staged in support of the Toronto Typographical Union’s strike for a 58-hour work-week. Police arrested 24 leaders of the Typographical Union. Labour leaders decided to call for a demonstration on September 3 to protest the arrests. The Toronto Trades and Labour Council began to hold similar celebrations every spring. American Peter J. McGuire, the co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, was asked to speak at a labour festival in Toronto, Canada on July 22, 1882. Returning to the United States, McGuire and the Knights of Labor organised a similar parade based on the Canadian event on September 5, 1882.</p> <p>In the 1800s, unions covered only a small fraction of workers and were relatively weak. The goal of organizations like the Central Labor Union and more modern-day counterparts was to bring many small unions together to become more powerful. The organizers of the first Labor Day were interested in creating an event that brought different types of workers together to meet each other and recognize their common interests. Unions increase the bargaining power of workers, which translates into higher earnings and a stronger voice for employees.</p> <p>But like so many workers’ initiatives, Labor Day was co-opted by the government and by the employers. It became a federal holiday in 1894, when, following the murder of workers during the Pullman Strike, in an attempt to appease the nation’s workers, President Grover Cleveland fearing further conflict, rushed legislation through Congress to designate the first Monday in September Labor Day. The Cleveland Administration believed it would act as a counterweight to May Day, the international day of labor solidarity adopted by the First Congress of the Second Socialist International in 1889 to commemorate the Haymarket Massacre in Chicago in 1886 so from its outset Labor Day symbolized the official American labor movement’s commitment to a more moderate form of politics! May Day emphasized the fact that the working class had to fight for its right to organize and for all the gains it had won in wages, hours and conditions of work. It was to counteract the militant working-class spirit of its marching legions on May Day that the government set aside the first Monday in September as a labor holiday. The American Labor Day holiday came as a “gift” that the workers received from their masters, through their servile politicians.</p> <p>Labor Day must not become a symbol of workers’ docility, of collaboration with the bosses, of everything that weakens and hurts the working class. It cannot be a day when politicians and employers advertise and promote themselves. Every shrewd politician will pose as a “friend of labor”, shaking hands and jovially slapping the labor union leaders on the back (later to stab them in the back), seeking to secure their endorsement and election donations with a lot of empty promises and false hopes before setting off the legislatures on the labor vote, promptly forgetting the pledges until next election rolls around.</p> <p>The reformists have kept socialist politics out of the trade union movement, while capitalist politics have run amok undoing the strength of the unions.</p> <p>Many working people now vote against their economic interests. Unions have donated more than millions to pro-business politicians.</p> <p>“Unions fail partly from the injudicious use of their powers,” wrote Marx. The World Socialist Movement does not shy away from warning our fellow workers what pitfalls are in store for them if they persist in giving their time, money and votes to parties that can only work in the interests of their masters. It is time that cash was directed at more worthwhile causes such as organizing the non-unionized.</p> <p>On Labor Day we must expose that great falsehood the slogan of “a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work.” Since wages imply exploitation and represent but a minor fraction of the total product of labor, it is self-evident that wages can never be fair. Wages grow out of a system of unfairness, of robbery. Accordingly, for labor to acknowledge that there is such a thing as a “fair wage” is to kowtow to the principle of exploitation, to kiss the hand that robs it and impresses on the mind of labor the “duty” to deliver its goods—its ability to produce—to the master joyfully and to the fullest capacity. It puts on the worker, by his own consent, the brand of the slave.</p> <p>The history of the North American movement is rich in the tradition of the importance of unions to workers. The struggles waged and the gains won by workers demonstrate what can be achieved through organizing on the economic field. We have the unions to thank for a lot of things we take for granted: the eight-hour workday, child labor laws, health and safety standards and the weekend. And studies show that a large union presence in an industry or region can raise wages even for non-union workers. But as weak and ineffectual as the labor movement is today, it is still a potential threat.</p> <p>The history of the labor movement proves the Marxian contention that wages are not regulated by any “iron law” but can be modified by organized militant action on the part of the workers. The necessity of native-born and foreign workers; black, hispanic and white, to march together on picket lines, to work together in strike committees and hold out together until their demands are won – all this constitutes an object lesson in class solidarity that American and Canadian workers must learn and practice.</p> <p>It is time that Labor Day 2021 brings home the point: There is a need for a change in our society. Socialism is a necessity. It would destroy the capitalist system wherein one class is enriched by exploiting the majority. We need socialism because the means of life, the factories, mines, transport, communications and land should belong to the people! We need socialism because the production of the necessities of life would be for the use of the people instead of the profit of a few. The capitalist world heaps misery upon misery upon the backs of the toilers. Capitalism remains what it has been from birth: a system of exploitation of the many for the enrichment of the few. Labor Day should remind us of the urgency to move towards socialism. The capitalist world heaps misery upon misery upon the backs of the toilers. Capitalism remains what it has been from birth: a system of exploitation of the many for the enrichment of the few. Labor Day should remind us of the urgency to move towards socialism.</p> <p>We are all one—all workers of all lands and climes. We know not color, nor creed, nor gender in the workers’ movement. We know only that that with the solidarity of labor, we will vanquish wage-slavery and humanize the World. But when all is said and done, the workers won’t get much from this annual love-fest of Labor Day messages and speeches. Government is dismissive at all levels to the interests of the working class. The monied alone are served. The only solution is a revolutionary change.</p> <p>As you enjoy this holiday do well to remember that it was paid for by union sweat and on occasions in union blood.</p> <p>The Socialist Party of Canada and the World Socialist Party of the United States on this Labor Day sounds forth the historic battle-cry of the Marx and the World Socialist Movement:</p> <p>“Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains! You have a world to gain!”</p>",4
940804495,"Alpa Shah, Explaining Modi, NLR 124, July–August 2020",2020-08-14 00:00:00,"<p>If the opinion polls are right, India’s Narendra Modi is currently the world’s most popular leader. His approval rating was over 80 per cent at the height of the pandemic in April and May this year, with Johnson, Trudeau and López Obrador in the low 60s, while Trump, Macron and Abe all failed to reach 50 per cent. The 2019 elections gave him a second term with a commanding majority of Lok Sabha seats. At the same time, Modi’s record towards his country’s minorities—imposing martial law on Kashmir, excluding Muslims from the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act, quietly tolerating an epidemic of lynchings, burnings and beatings of Muslims and Dalits—has been qualitatively more brutal than that of Bolsonaro or Trump. How should we account for the Modi phenomenon? The starting point of Kapil Komireddi’s Malevolent Republic is that Modi should not be seen as an aberration: that would be ‘a self-comforting lie’. Instead, Komireddi—a freelance journalist from Hyderabad, now based in the West—offers three reasons for his rise.</p> <p>First, Malevolent Republic points to decades of Congress Party failings—above all, the corruption, nepotism, authoritarianism and greed of its ruling family. Although Nehru and Gandhi are absolved, from the 1960s the party became ‘a sump for Nehru’s parasitical progeny to luxuriate in’. The first half of the book is a ruthless chronological accounting of Congress misdeeds, as leader after leader is excoriated in the run up to Modi: ‘Erosion’, ‘Surrender’, ‘Decadence’, ‘Dissolution’, run the chapter headings. Nehru’s daughter Indira displayed ‘despotic impulses’, using Congress ‘as a laboratory to test her will’, while her son Sanjay lacked even a ‘residue of democratic inclination’, as exemplified in the slum-clearance and sterilization campaigns he ran during the 1975–77 period of Emergency Rule. Millions of people lost their homes as entire districts were bulldozed in Sanjay’s ‘beautification’ projects, while millions of poor and vulnerable men were dragged under the knife to meet his ‘family-planning’ targets. Dissenters, defenders of democratic rights, trade unionists, socialists, were imprisoned without charge, the press was heavily censored, foreign journalists expelled and Sanjay glorified by the media.</p> <p>After the blowback from Indira’s military assault on the Sikhs’ Golden Temple—she was assassinated in 1984 by her own Sikh bodyguards—her other son, Rajiv, initiated his reign with a pogrom orchestrated by local Congress leaders. Three thousand Sikhs were killed in Delhi, police even disarming Sikh areas before the mob marched in—setting a precedent, Komireddi notes, for the slaughter of Muslims that took place in Gujarat under Modi in 2002. It was Rajiv who ordered that the gates of Ayodhya be opened, allowing Hindu nationalists to lay the foundations for a future temple inside the Babri Mosque. When Muslim leaders protested, Rajiv appeased them by banning Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses, having already sabotaged Muslim women’s rights in the Shah Bano case. After Rajiv’s assassination—blowback again: having sent Indian troops into Sri Lanka, he was killed by a Tamil suicide bomber—the new Congress leader, Narasimha Rao, cultivated ties with the bjp, staying silent as the Babri Mosque was destroyed. The Congress Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh, is denounced by Komireddi as a ‘subcontinental Pinochet’ for his counter-insurgency against the Naxalites and his harsh neoliberal measures, cutting subsidies and handing land over to foreign corporations. Rapid economic growth was accompanied by rising inequality. Demoralized by decades of Congress betrayals, unshackled by Rao and Singh’s neoliberal reforms from Nehruvian ideals of self-restraint, the expanding Hindu middle class was ready to see in the violence of Ayodhya and its follow-ups ‘a self-empowering, even redemptive, message’.</p> <p>Second, Malevolent Republic turns upon India’s ‘secular historians’ and public intellectuals. Romila Thapar, author of the renowned Penguin History of India, Volume One and many other works on early Indian history, is a particular target. According to Komireddi, these scholars’ ‘well-intentioned sanitization of the past’ failed to supply an adequate account of the Persian and Moghul imperial invasions of northern India and the centuries of Muslim rule. In the first decades after Independence, he argues, these intellectuals squandered the chance to provide (Hindu) Indians with a forthright narrative of their ‘ravaged’ heritage—the great mosques built from shattered temple fragments—that could have reconciled them to their ‘harrowing past’ and allowed a mature detachment from it. Instead, Thapar and her colleagues ‘papered over the gruesome deeds of the invaders with nice-nellyisms’, preferring to dwell on their cultural achievements. School textbooks presented an idyllic picture of medieval India in which Muslims and Hindus coexisted in harmony, shattered only by the arrival of the British. But the Muslim encounter left a ‘deep wound’, Komireddi argues. The euphemization of Moghul rule by Thapar and her colleagues had ‘infantilized Indians’, rendering them susceptible to ‘the piffle of Hindu nationalists’ who seized the chance to ‘weaponize history’, portraying Muslims as insensitive to innocent Hindus’ wounded feelings. This, according to Malevolent Republic, provides the second precondition for Modi’s rise: ‘The confusion of a country that deferred the task of dealing sincerely with its wounded past was ripe for exploitation’.</p> <p>Third, Komireddi argues, big-business backing—from the Tatas to the Ambani brothers—and praise from such eminent scholars as Columbia’s Jagdish Bhagwati or Gurcharan Das, Harvard-educated author of India Unbound, were crucial to the bjp’s success. ‘Intellectuals and industrialists’ polished Modi’s image as a ‘technocratic modernizer’, celebrated his ‘vision’ and ability to get things done. And India’s ‘shameless elites were easily co-opted to pimp for him, asking only for a commitment to the market in return’. Foreign investors, diplomats and politicians made the pilgrimage to Modi’s capital in Gandhinagar for his trade fairs when he was chief minister of Gujarat, from 2001–14. Although Gujarat’s growth was accompanied by low social mobility, it was widely presented as the development model of India, with perfect roads, electricity and clean water. Support from the West was equally fulsome, and the 2002 Gujarati massacre soon forgotten. Before the 2014 election, Time magazine listed Modi as one of the world’s most influential leaders, Cameron put on an honour guard for him, Hollande organized a boat ride on the Seine, Obama offered flattery. Hence ‘there wasn’t a shadow of resistance as Narendra Modi stormed Delhi in the summer of 2014’.</p> <p>The second half of Malevolent Republic covers Modi’s record in office. A series of short thematic chapters explore the Modi personality cult (3d holographic projectors beaming his image into villages without electricity); the monstrously bungled ‘de-monetization’ policy; the rise of cow vigilantes and escalation of anti-Muslim violence; and the assertion of bjp influence across India’s institutions, from the Reserve Bank of India to the universities and Supreme Court. The treatment here is more journalistic; much of the material will be familiar to readers of the international press. On Kashmir and on foreign policy, however, Komireddi emerges as a hard-line hawk. He commends Modi for cutting an ‘imposing figure on the world stage’, ‘confidently projecting Delhi as a rival to Beijing’ and ‘translating his muscular attitude into action’ by sending troops into Bhutan in 2017 to block a Chinese road-building project. He then dismisses him for being insufficiently tough when the Bhutan invasion ‘collapsed into a desperate face-saving exercise’ after Washington declined to send reinforcements. Above all, the book is suffused with hostility to Pakistan—a ‘monument to majoritarian bigotry’, gripped by ‘neurotic nationalism’, ruled by ‘vultures’. Alone of the many leaders Komireddi discusses, Bhutto, Pakistan’s prime minister in the 1970s, is disparagingly referred to as ‘Zulfi’ at every point.</p> <p>What explains Malevolent Republic’s hyper-aggressive regional-policy line, apparently out-Modi-ing Modi? The answer may lie in Komireddi’s cursus as a journalist. He owes a major debt, he explains, to the mentorship of David Frum, the neoconservative Canadian-American publicist best known for coining the ‘axis of evil’ slogan for Bush’s 2002 State of the Union address. In 2009, Frum recruited Komireddi, fresh out of us law school and without a clear idea of what he wanted to do, and funded him to tour Pakistan to produce a 10-part series for the Frum Forum website, under the title ‘Pakistan: Anatomy of a Failed State’. Frum’s editorializing sets the tone: ‘India’s success at forging a nationality out of its diversity stood as a towering repudiation of the very idea of Pakistan’—‘Pakistan could not succeed unless India failed.’ Or again: ‘The terrorism with which we contend has its origins in Pakistan as much as in the Arab Middle East. Our friend Kapil Komireddi has returned from traveling inside Pakistan . . .’ Also in 2009, Komireddi—presumably with Frum’s help—published a ‘stand up to China’ piece in Foreign Policy (‘Time for India to play hardball with China’) and a Guardian opinion column on Kashmir: ‘Over 60 arduous years, India has integrated radically diverse regions under the banner of a pluralistic nationalism. Its failure to achieve that in Kashmir is largely due to Pakistan.’</p>",4

Navandar passed the order on Mr. Navlakha’s plea, while also rejecting his application seeking a three-day extension from arrest.</p> <p>It is likely that Mr. Navlakha would be soon taken in the custody of the Pune police as the extension of his interim relief period granted by the Supreme Court in October expires today.</p> <p>The Pune police is probing Mr. Navlakha, along with 21 other prominent lawyers, academics, Dalit and human rights activists, in this case in which so far nine persons have been booked under relevant provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).</p> <p>Earlier, the Bombay High Court had directed Mr. Navlakha to approach the Pune sessions court for anticipatory bail.</p> <p>The Delhi-based activist had accordingly withdrawn his anticipatory bail plea in the Bombay High Court and filed a plea the next day.</p> <p>In September this year, the Bombay High Court had refused to quash the Pune police’s case against Mr. Navlakha. The case was registered under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which included charging the activist with sedition.</p> <p>However, the High Court had extended Mr. Navlakha’s interim relief from arrest by three weeks, allowing him to appeal in the Supreme Court.</p> <p>On October 4, the Apex Court had extended Navlakha’s protection from arrest till October 15. This was extended by a further four weeks and is due to expire today.</p> <p>Last week, the Pune court had heard the arguments of both the prosecution and the defence on Mr. Navlakha’s plea.</p> <p>Arguing against giving him bail, prosecution lawyer Ujjwala Pawar dubbed Mr. Navlakha an “anti-national” who was allegedly trying to unite the banned CPI (Maoist) with the outlawed Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, a pro-Pakistani terror group from Kashmir.</p> <p>Advocate Pawar sought Mr. Navlakha’s custodial interrogation on grounds that the authorities needed to ascertain the ‘damage’ caused by the alleged links held by the accused with the Maoists and the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.</p> <p>In his petition, Mr. Navlakha’s counsel had observed that the Pune Police has failed to establish any connection between him and the [Bhima-Koregaon clashes] incident or any plan for disrupting the established government of the country as alleged by the Police.</p> <p>The petition had further observed that there was merely an allegation of a suspicion that Mr. Navlakha is acquainted with certain alleged members of the banned organization, the CPI (Maoist).</p> <p>Mr. Navlakha’s counsel, lawyer Ragini Ahuja had argued that the activist had, in fact, a role to play in assisting the State in rescuing officials abducted by Maoists and that he had not only condemned left-wing violence but also negotiated on behalf of the State in the rescue operation for abducted officials.</p> <p>The civil rights activist was first arrested by the police on August 28 last year in the second countrywide crackdown by the Pune police against prominent academics intellectuals in the Elgaar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon case.</p> <p>At the time, Mr. Navlakha was arrested with four other including poet P.Varavara Rao, activists Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves and trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj, while the houses of academic Anand Teltumbde and tribal activist Father Stan Swamy were searched in a series of raids conducted by the Pune police against academics and activists known for their dissentious views against the powers that be and their work among the dispossessed.</p> <p>However, the five including Mr. Navlakha were put under house arrest the very next day (on August 29) following a Supreme Court order on a plea filed by historian Romila Thapar along with economists Prabhat Patnaik and Devaki Jain among others against the Pune police’s action.</p> <p>Since then, the spectre of being taken again into the police’s custody has dogged Mr. Navlakha.</p> <p>Ms. Bharadwaj, Mr. Rao, Mr. Gonsalves and Mr. Ferreira are presently incarcerated in Pune's Yerwada prison along with other activists advocate Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut and Sudhir Dhawale.</p> <p>The Pune City police’s case rests on an FIR registered at the city’s Vishrambaug police station (in January 2018) under sections 153 (a) [Promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race etc], 505 1 (b) among others in connection with the ‘Elgaar Parishad’ held at Pune’s Shaniwarwada Fort on December 31, 2017 as part of the bicentenary celebrations of the Bhima-Koregaon battle.</p> <p>The FIR, based on a complaint by one Tushar Damgude in the immediate aftermath of the Bhima-Koregaon clashes of January 1, was initially lodged against six participants, including Mr. Dhawale. Those named in the FIR were members of the Kabir Kala Manch – a radical Dalit cultural troupe.</p> <p>The complainant had accused the KKM activists of making a number of “inflammatory” speeches and delivering “socially divisive” presentations during the course of the troupe’s performance and recitals at the ‘Elgaar Parishad’, which lasted nearly eight hours and witnessed the participation of thousands of persons from more than 250 progressive social outfits including several left-leaning and Ambedkarite groups across Maharashtra.</p> <p>The raids and subsequent arrests of the prominent activists and academics were based on this FIR, with the Pune police claiming to have extended the scope of their investigations to unearth alleged ‘Maoist links’ held by these intellectuals.</p>",4
904302123,Death scene at John Vorster Square was neglectfully pro...,2020-02-06 00:00:00,"<p>Neil Aggett was a white South African doctor and trade union organiser who died while in detention after being arrested by the South African Security Police in 1982. (Photo: Chris Collingridge)</p> <p>Neil Aggett was alive at the moment he was strung up against the bars in the John Vorster Square (now Johannesburg Central Police Station) prison cell where he was found hanged.</p> <p>He may not have been conscious, but he was certainly “vital”. This is the conclusion of pathologist Dr Steve Naidoo who presented his testimony yesterday, Thursday 6 February, at the reopened inquest into the death of the trade unionist and doctor who was found dead in detention in 1982.</p> <p>Naidoo said Aggett’s body showed injuries consistent with “vital reactions” – the live body’s reaction to the impact of being hanged. There were two distinct haemorrhages that Naidoo pointed out could not have occurred after death.</p> <p>Naidoo also said that death occurred in one of two possible ways. The first “mechanism of death” would have involved the closing and compression around the carotid arteries that are on each side of the neck that would have caused unconsciousness in seconds and then death within a minute or two.</p> <p>The other possibility he outlined would have been as a result of the neck being constricted and the sudden gravitational traction from being hanged that would have caused a rapid drop of blood pressure, and in turn a slowing of the heart and then death minutes later.</p> <p>He said in his affidavit: “The only reasonable conclusion in this case is that the death was caused by the state of suspensory hanging of the body by constrictive ligature around the neck.”</p> <p>Naidoo, who was the independent pathologist commissioned by the pro bono attorneys working on behalf of the Aggett family, spent most of his time on the stand showing up the “troubling shortcomings” and inconsistencies, the lack of supervisory oversight and outright professional neglect in how the death scene was processed and how the post mortem processes were carried out.</p> <p>Key among the failings that Naidoo pointed out were the absence of photographs of the body at the death scene. There were also no autopsy photographs taken under correct lighting and guidance of a pathologist with labels, measurements and scales. There are only two grainy black and white photos of Aggett’s body when it was hanging from the prison cell bars.</p> <p>In political cases, the State’s chief pathologist was also responsible for overseeing an autopsy, not a district surgeon as was the case with Aggett.</p> <p>“A death of a political detainee from hanging would always have come with a query and a challenge. A chief pathologist present at the death scene and conducting the autopsy would have been able to narrow the window of possibility from the precise nature of the ligature (a kikoi is the item that appears around Aggett’s neck at the death scene), how this ligature lay, how it was tied and importantly the possibility of someone securing the ligature to themselves,” he said.</p> <p>Naidoo said the autopsy was rushed and was completed just seven hours after the recorded discovery of the body at 1.30am on 5 February 1982.</p> <p>He added: “The family was not given the time and pre-counselling in order to digest and prepare and to bring in a private pathologist from the beginning. So the family’s rights were disregarded.”</p> <p>Naidoo also said the post mortem didn’t include processes to reveal subcutaneous bruising that doesn’t appear on the skin, even though the technique was already in use at the time.</p> <p>Naidoo continues his testimony on Friday. The precise and graphic details of what happened to Aggett’s body in the moments leading to his death are what Aggett’s family and friends have had to hear in the South Gauteng High Court.</p> <p>These details have given the likes of Liz Floyd answers. Floyd was Aggett’s partner. She’s also a medical doctor and recently retired from her position at the Gauteng Department of Health.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to look at the photos, not till this time last year, and the more I looked the more I could see that there was something wrong. I also volunteered to translate the jargon in the medical reports for the legal team and when I started comparing what the doctors had written in their reports and what I remembered I saw the contradictions,” Floyd said outside the court on Thursday.</p> <p>Floyd had till then accepted that Aggett had been driven to suicide. She herself was severely tortured and suffered post-traumatic stress after Aggett’s death and her own detention.</p> <p>Floyd’s medical background, as well as her personal connection to Aggett, makes for a unique lens through which she can communicate about the medical and forensic findings.</p> <p>“It’s also that it’s 38 years later,” she adds. “We are going through an inquest this time where there isn’t extreme intimidation, hostility and threat to our personal safety. We also have the support of our loved ones and the support of other detainees – it’s like a family reunion and we’re catching up on all the gossip,” she says with a giggle.</p> <p>It makes hearing graphic details about Aggett’s dying just that tiny bit more bearable.

926797406,British photographer arrested and charged in US for covering protests,2020-06-01 14:46:27+01:00,"<p>A BRITISH photographer has been arrested and charged by cops in New York while covering police brutality protests in the US.</p> <p>Adam Gray, chief photographer for British news agency SWNS, was held in prison, in close proximity to 70 others with his PPE mask confiscated, for more than 10-and-a-half hours.</p> <p>The 33-year-old was on assignment for The Sun US in New York when he was apprehended by several officers, forced to the ground, and his equipment damaged.</p> <p>The incident, which is reported to have taken place near Union Square amid widespread protests across the country, came despite the photographer holding full press credentials.</p> <p>Mr Gray said he has now been “charged with unlawful assembly for taking pictures of protesters and police,” and will appear in court later this year.</p> <p>He added: “No social distancing was possible and many prisoners had their masks taken off them for a photo and not returned or provided with new ones. Extreme risk to personal health.”</p> <p>The arrest of a British journalist, and the behaviour of police officers, has been criticised by campaigners for press freedom.</p> <p>Representatives from the International Federation of Journalists have said that the targeting of journalists “must be punished” and those who “who attack and threaten journalists must be held to account.”</p> <p>General secretary Anthony Bellanger said: “Adam Gray’s arrest is yet another example of the outrageous response of the US authorities to being subjected to legitimate scrutiny.</p> <p>“Adam posed no danger, was clearly identified as a journalist and was working but faced arrest and detention, which in light of the current pandemic, could be potentially life-threatening.</p> <p>“Led by a President who vilifies and threatens the media on a regular basis, the US authorities’ war on journalists and media freedom must stop.”</p> <p>This incident follows criticism from trade unions representing journalists on both sides of the Atlantic, as they are targeted in their attempts to cover the developing protests against police brutality in light of the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota.</p> <p>These include the on-air arrest of CNN journalist Omar Jimenez, with reports suggesting more than 90 journalists have now been arrested covering demonstrations in the past week.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has branded the incidents very concerning, adding: “Journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.”</p>",4
987125429,Hyundai and Renault-Nissan forced to shut Indian plants due to worker unrest over lack of COVID-19 protections,2021-05-27 00:00:00,"<p>After rank-and-file workers staged a sit-down strike Monday to protest the lack of COVID-19 protections, management at a Hyundai Motors plant in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu announced a five-day suspension of operations, starting Tuesday. The autoworkers were protesting the dangerous working conditions at the plant, where 150 are currently being treated for COVID-19 symptoms, according to a union official. Ten Hyundai Motors India workers have already perished from the virus.</p> <p>Five thousand workers at Renault-Nissan’s car plant, also located in the Sriperumbudur-Oragaram industrial belt, were set to follow the example of their Hyundai colleagues by walking off the job Wednesday. At least five Renault-Nissan workers have lost their lives to the virus. Well aware that social tensions are at the boiling point and that the protest movement could spread like wildfire, Renault-Nissan management subverted the job action by announcing a five-day suspension of plant operations until May 30.</p> <p>Renault Nissan Automotive India workers (Credit: global.nissannews.com)</p> <p>The Renault-Nissan workers said that their demands for COVID-19 protections had been ignored. CNBC TV18 reported that the workers’ main complaints are a lack of medical insurance, management’s insistence on running the plant at full capacity—making social distancing impossible—and cramped canteens.</p> <p>Prior to the shutdown, Renault-Nissan had demanded that workers maintain a backbreaking pace of 27 jobs per hour on line 1 and 40 jobs per hour on line 2. With 95 percent of the workers 40 and younger yet to be vaccinated, management’s decision to keep the factory operating at full tilt has allowed the virus to run rampant through the plant.</p> <p>The Tamil Nadu autoworkers’ job action underscores that it is the global working class that is the main source of opposition to the ruling elite’s criminal “open economy” policy, which prioritizes capitalist profit over saving workers’ lives. In spring 2020, autoworkers in Canada and the United States, and other industrial workers in Italy and Spain, carried out work stoppages in open rebellion against the corporatist trade unions, which, like the employers, were desperate to keep production running. These job actions saved countless thousands of lives, forcing the ruling elites in North America and Europe to impose temporary shutdowns that they otherwise had no intention of ever implementing.</p> <p>Likewise, the eruption of working-class anger over the callous indifference displayed by the Indian ruling elite towards workers’ lives testifies to the deep and widespread opposition to the “profits before lives” response to COVID-19 pursued by the Indian government at all levels. India is currently the world epicentre of the pandemic, with well over 4,000 official daily deaths now being recorded. The true depth of the crisis is far worse, with credible estimates suggesting that tens of thousands are dying every day.</p> <p>Narendra Modi’s far-right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central government bears chief responsibility for this catastrophe. It has insisted on keeping the economy open at all costs and is refusing to provide social support to the hundreds of millions thrust into destitution by the limited lockdown measures imposed by some state governments. Last month, as daily infections approached 300,000 and official daily deaths climbed past 3,000, Modi declared it was necessary to “save India from lockdown,” not to save the Indian people from the deadly virus.</p> <p>However, the opposition parties defend the interests of corporate India no less ruthlessly. In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was recently elected to the state government as the lead party of an electoral alliance including the Congress Party, till recently the ruling class’s preferred party of national government, and the twin Stalinist parties, the Communist Party of India–Marxist (CPM) and Communist Party of India (CPI).</p> <p>The DMK regime, like its AIADMK predecessor, which was a close ally of Modi and his BJP, has maintained a policy of allowing factories and other industrial worksites to continue operating as if there were no pandemic. Although the DMK government officially unveiled a statewide lockdown after coming to power, it granted massive exemptions for industrial worksites and factories. Speaking much like Modi, DMK chairman and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin remarked, “Lockdowns cannot be the solution, as we also realize that it impacts economic growth.”</p> <p>In the face of this brutal class-war agenda, the job actions by the Hyundai and Renault Nissan workers are only the most prominent examples of mounting working-class anger. At MRF Tyres Ltd., in Puducherry, a Union Territory adjacent to Tamil Nadu, workers mounted strikes last week to demand justice and compensation for two workers who had died from COVID-19, and for the immediate shutdown of the company’s plants. More than 300 workers at Caparo India, an auto parts company, took strike action against unsafe working conditions and the death of an unknown number of workers at its plants. The strike, which began on May 15, was sabotaged by the Stalinist-led Centre of Indian Trade Unions federation on May 21.</p> <p>In the absence of any official records of worker deaths, and with regional and national newspapers consciously covering up the extent of the slaughter, workers have begun sharing information on workplace deaths via social media. According to these sources, more than 25 workers have died in recent weeks at various globally connected companies just in Tamil Nadu. The death toll is especially high in the Sriperumbudur-Oragaram industrial area, which is located on the outskirts of Chennai, India’s fourth-largest urban agglomeration and Tamil Nadu’s capital. The entire region has been dubbed the “Detroit of Asia” because millions of autoworkers are employed there in sweatshop conditions.</p> <p>In the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt in the northern state of Haryana, Rajesh, one of the current leaders of the Maruti Suzuki Employees Union, and various workers forums and blogs, such as the Hindi-language Mehnatkash and Workers Unity, report that more than 20 workers have died during the recent surge in COVID-19 infections. These include five workers at Maruti Suzuki’s plant in Gurgaon, two workers at a Honda plant and one worker at the Tata Motors facility.</p> <p>The conditions of brutal exploitation that prevail in the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt were exemplified by the monstrous 2012 company-government frame-up of Maruti Suzuki workers. In 2017, 13 militant workers at Maruti Suzuki’s Manesar car assembly plant were sent to jail for life. Their sole “crime” was to have led a year-long struggle, including sit-down strikes and occupations, against a brutal work regime and precarious contract-labour jobs and to build an independent union in opposition to a company-backed, state-sponsored union.</p> <p>As the anger among workers has grown over the past year over speedup, poverty wages and the lack of COVID-19 protections, the trade unions have worked systematically to isolate and suppress their struggles. The Stalinist-led CITU, Maoist-led AICCTU, and the LTUC in Tamil Nadu have consistently isolated workers’ struggles from one another and from the wider urban and rural workforce. Each group of workers has been left to fight their government-backed transnational employer alone.</p> <p>At Renault-Nissan, the Renault-Nissan India Thozhillalar Sangam (RNITS) trade union, which is currently under the control of the Maoist People’s Power group, urged workers last week to focus their efforts on a lawsuit aimed at getting the courts to intervene and order improvements in their working conditions. Providing yet another cynical twist to the ruling elite’s “open economy” policy, the two-judge bench at the Madras High Court promptly responded, “[W]hile the health of workers is paramount, if industries go down there will be no place for them to work.”</p> <p>The growing number of unnecessary worker deaths underscores the urgency of an immediate shutdown of nonessential production, including the auto industry, in Tamil Nadu and across India to combat the spread of the disease and save hundreds of thousands of lives. This must be accompanied with full compensation for all workers affected and their families until the pandemic is brought under control.</p> <p>The billions made by the automakers and other major companies, and the hundreds of billions India’s billionaires “earned” this year from the monies the world’s central banks poured into the financial markets, must be confiscated to pay for a massive public health program, including free and universal vaccinations and social support for workers, their families, and India’s impoverished masses.</p> <p>To fight for this programme, we urge autoworkers to establish rank-and-file action committees in every plant and at every workplace. These committees must become the political leadership and organisational framework through which workers can unify their struggles in a joint counteroffensive to place the protection of the health and very lives of the population ahead of corporate profits.</p> <p>The struggle against the pandemic, which is a global phenomenon that knows no boundaries, must be waged on an international basis and as a working-class political struggle. We urge Indian autoworkers and all other workers to lend their support to the construction of the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees, which is spearheading a global mobilisation of the working class, the only social force capable of combatting the pandemic and saving lives. What this requires above all is the fight for the socialist transformation of society, which is the only way to prevent globally organized corporations like Renault-Nissan, Hyundai, and Suzuki from pitting workers against each other along national lines to cut labour costs and making massive profits while their workers get sick and die.</p> <p>We urge all workers across India who agree with this perspective to make plans to attend this Sunday’s online meeting “The COVID-19 pandemic in India and the need for a socialist strategy.” It begins at 6 p.m. Indian Standard Time.</p>",4

985277104,"Washington and AFL-CIO file labor complaints in Matamoros and Silao, Mexico",2021-05-17 00:00:00,"<p>On May 10, the AFL-CIO bureaucracy in the United States asked the Biden administration to file the first labor complaint under the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal.</p> <p>The AFL-CIO document states that the management of the Tridonex auto parts plant in Matamoros, Mexico, has violated the right of its employees to leave the local branch of the corrupt Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) and join the Independent National Union of Industry and Service Workers (SNITIS), led by labor lawyer Susana Prieto Terrazas.</p> <p>The letter notes that Tridonex, a subsidiary of Philadelphia-based Cardone Industries, “fired more than 600 supporters of the independent union SNITIS, which was created after 2019 labor protests forced the maquiladoras in Matamoros to raise wages.”</p> <p>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City, Friday, April 3, 2020. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)</p> <p>The same week that the AFL-CIO called on the US to intervene in Matamoros, the Biden administration decided to file a separate labor complaint, also under the USMCA. It requested that the Mexican government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (known as AMLO) review a fraudulent union recognition vote involving threats and ballot-stuffing by CTM gangsters, known as charros, aimed at maintaining the CTM’s control over the contract at the General Motors factory in Silao, in the central state of Guanajuato.</p> <p>Workers in Mexico should be highly suspicious of these efforts. The same government in Washington is currently backing the massacre of Palestinian workers and children by Israeli bombs and the killing and “disappearing” of hundreds of Colombian workers and youth by that country’s police, who are trained and armed by the United States.</p> <p>The request by the Biden administration follows an earlier letter signed by US Representatives Dan Kildee, Bill Pascrell and Earl Blumenauer asking GM itself to “speak out against violations of labor and human rights abuses at the Silao GM plant.”</p> <p>The Canadian trade union Unifor and the so-called IndustriAll Global Union also released letters to GM and Mexican government authorities denouncing the fraudulent vote at Silao.</p> <p>On May 11, the Mexican Labor Ministry acknowledged that it had found “serious irregularities” in the vote at Silao and would order the CTM affiliate to hold a new vote within 30 days to legitimize its contract with GM. The ministry also filed a complaint with state prosecutors, setting the stage for a possible criminal investigation.</p> <p>GM said it would hire a firm to conduct an “independent review” of the allegations, but insisted that Labor Ministry inspectors had supervised the vote and conditions at the plant. However, according to workers at the plant who spoke to the WSWS, the Labor Ministry inspectors would meet only CTM union officials and workers that had been threatened and/or bribed.</p> <p>Having ignored numerous previous complaints by GM workers at Silao, López Obrador himself said last Wednesday that “the US government is right,” adding that “We had confirmed it and it had been condemned.” He then promised to respond to the US request “immediately.”</p> <p>In a statement pledging to cooperate with the inquiry, the CTM directly addressed the real concerns of the ruling class. “The CTM does not generate conflicts,” it declared, “nor is it an obstacle for the development of industry and trade.”</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the AMLO government will assist the CTM and GM in carrying out another fraudulent vote fraud to renew their contract. That would require demonstrating majority support for the contract, with “yes” votes representing at least 30 percent of the total workforce. Alternately, AMLO might allow another registered trade union to negotiate and compete against the CTM for a separate contract.</p> <p>This validation process is a new requirement for all contracts under AMLO’s “labor reform,” which incorporates the labor provisions of the USMCA. However, in the two years since the “reform” took effect, AMLO has not only given a free hand to the CTM, but has continued, like past governments, to rely on its violent harassment and policing of workers to suppress their struggles.</p> <p>Moreover, Mexican Labor Minister Luisa Alcalde has insisted that it is acting in “daily coordination with US labor authorities,” and that the 500,000 contracts in the country will most likely not be revalidated before the May 2023 deadline. Nor has the ministry given any sign that it intends to invest in the enforcement resources required to oversee all these procedures. When asked about the lack of enforcement of the labor reform, AMLO has simply said that he will not interfere in “internal” union affairs.</p> <p>Far from the dawn of “union democracy” in Mexico, or the crusade against CTM corruption that AMLO promised, the USMCA and his government’s labor “reform” program are aimed at extinguishing the fires of socialist internationalism wherever they erupt among Mexican workers influenced by the World Socialist Web Site. In addition to belonging to the one-million-strong auto workforce in Mexico, what the workers at Tridonex and Matamoros have in common is precisely their connection to the WSWS.</p> <p>The labor reform was rushed into law in May 2019 after tens of thousands of maquiladora workers organized wildcat strikes in opposition to the CTM. As analyzed by the WSWS in articles widely shared by Matamoros workers, Susana Prieto worked with US-aligned “independent unions” to sideline the democratic strike committees and mass assemblies set up by the workers themselves. During a mass march to the nearby US border at Brownsville, Texas, the Matamoros strikers called on American workers to join their struggle and made numerous appeals to workers internationally, through the WSWS.</p> <p>After initially insisting that workers had to rely on the hated CTM union locals at Tridonex and other plants, Prieto and the Electricians Union (SME)—both long-time collaborators of the AFL-CIO—formed the SNITIS “independent” union to channel and suppress the ongoing unrest.</p> <p>With billions of dollars in auto parts, electronics and defense products on the line in Matamoros, Prieto subsequently worked to contain new waves of wildcat strikes in 2020 by workers demanding shutdowns with full compensation when workers began falling ill with COVID-19. Prieto and SNITIS subordinated this struggle to AMLO’s May 2020 decrees declaring all manufacturing to be “essential.”</p> <p>Then, in January 2021, SNITIS called on Matamoros plants to strike for a 15 percent wage increase. No plant won the full increase and dozens of workers were fired.</p> <p>Thousands more workers have been fired in reprisals for the strikes in 2019 and 2020. SNITIS, however, has refused to organize any struggle against the layoffs and firings. Instead, Prieto used the 2021 strikes as a stunt to announce her entry as a candidate of AMLO’s Morena party in congressional elections to be held next month.</p> <p>A worker at the sugar processing factory Batory, who remained anonymous for fear of reprisal, told the WSWS that a group of workers fired in January sought help from Prieto, “and she told them that they knew what they were getting into and refused to help them.” The worker continued: “Now they are sad and regret having listened to her. The activist Susana Prieto ended up being more charra than the [CTM] charros.”</p> <p>At the GM plant in Silao, a group of rank-and-file workers called the Generating Movement, who had been fighting for years to rid themselves of the CTM, joined online calls organized by the WSWS with American autoworkers ahead of and during the September 2019 strike at GM in the United States. The Generating Movement workers acted courageously and in a principled manner to support the GM strikers in the US by refusing to go along with demands by GM at Silao for speedup and mandatory overtime. The company retaliated by carrying out numerous firings.</p> <p>Since this brave intervention, the AFL-CIO, the SME and other unions have sought to pressure the Generating Movement into organizing within one of the “independent” unions vetted by the Mexican government and sponsored by US imperialism.</p> <p>In sum, the Mexican and US authorities, with the help of pseudo-left outfits, are employing the prospect of replacing the CTM goons by “independent” charros sponsored by Washington to head off the struggle of workers to unite with their class brothers and sisters to the north and oppose capitalist exploitation.</p> <p>Within the United States, the complaints over union votes in Mexico coincide with an ongoing campaign by the Biden administration to prop up the existing trade unions, most recently by officially backing the unionization drive of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, plant. Less than 13 percent voted for the union.</p> <p>This expression of opposition to the pro-corporate unions in the US coincides with the sentiments of workers at the Silao plant, who have voted by similar percentages to reject the CTM.</p> <p>For his part, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement: “The USMCA requires Mexico to end the reign of protection unions and their corrupt deals with employers.” As Trumka himself well knows, if such a policy were enforced in the US, the AFL-CIO would be dissolved. As he was issuing this statement, a federal judge was sentencing Dennis Williams, former president of the United Auto Workers, to 21 months in jail for having stolen millions in union dues.</p> <p>Just as workers in Mexico face corruption, sellout contracts and harassment and violence by CTM charro officials, American workers confront similar conditions at the hands of the unions in the US. Nor is it any different for workers around the world.</p> <p>Promoting the myth being advanced around the USMCA labor provisions and Mexico’s “labor reform,” the New York Times wrote: “The trade deal seeks to improve labor conditions and pay for workers in Mexico, which proponents say would benefit American workers by deterring factory owners from moving their operations to Mexico from the United States in search of cheaper labor.”</p> <p>This narrative, while professing concern for workers, is based on the same reactionary and nationalist claims used by the AFL-CIO to divide American workers from their class brothers and sisters across the border, blaming Mexican workers for taking “American jobs.” American workers, according to this narrative, must accept endless concessions in wages, pensions, health care and working conditions to prevent jobs from going abroad.</p> <p>By pitting workers against each other, the capitalist rulers have been able to slash real wages for workers on both sides of the border over the past four decades, as the maquiladoras in Mexico grew dramatically.</p> <p>Within the US, the Democratic Party is seeking to breathe new life into the rotten corpse of the AFL-CIO, which is entirely integrated into the state. Its foreign policy arm, the Solidarity Center, receives 96 percent of its funding from the State Department. Biden’s point person for International Labor Affairs is Thea Lee, who was deputy chief of staff of the AFL-CIO between 1997 and 2017.</p> <p>The strategy of the US foreign policy establishment to promote “independent” unions in Mexico dates back to 1997, when these unions first organized within the National Workers Union (UNT). A few weeks after its foundation, the UNT and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo hosted the first trip of an AFL-CIO president, John Sweeney, to Mexico, with the aim of changing “the fossilized labor system,” as reported at the time by the New York Times.</p> <p>The International Committee of the Fourth International calls on workers to build the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees to consciously break from the nationalist and pro-capitalist framework of the trade unions and unify their struggles internationally on the basis the perspective of world socialist revolution.</p>",4
908067592,Journalists Speak Up for Julian Assange,2020-02-24 00:00:00,"<p>See: 1242 Signatures from 99 Countries as of 21 Feb 10:30 a.m. GMT</p> <p>[TMS editor is #700 on the list]</p> <p>Julian Assange, founder and publisher of WikiLeaks, is currently detained in Belmarsh high-security prison in the United Kingdom and faces extradition to the United States and criminal prosecution under the Espionage Act.</p> <p>He risks up to 175 years imprisonment for his part in making public the leak of US military documents from Afghanistan and Iraq, and a trove of US State Department cables.</p> <p>The ‘War Diaries’ provided evidence that the US Government misled the public about activities in Afghanistan and Iraq and committed war crimes. WikiLeaks partnered with a wide range of media organizations worldwide that republished the War Diaries and embassy cables.</p> <p>The legal action underway against Mr Assange sets an extremely dangerous precedent for journalists, media organizations and the freedom of the press.</p> <p>We, journalists and journalistic organizations around the globe, express our grave concern for Mr Assange’s wellbeing, for his continued detention and for the draconian espionage charges.</p> <p>This case stands at the heart of the principle of free speech. If the US government can prosecute Mr Assange for publishing classified documents, it may clear the way for governments to prosecute journalists anywhere, an alarming precedent for freedom of the press worldwide. Also, the use of espionage charges against people publishing materials provided by whistleblowers is a first and should alarm every journalist and publisher.</p> <p>In a democracy, journalists can reveal war crimes and cases of torture and abuse without having to go to jail. It is the very role of the press in a democracy. If governments can use espionage laws against journalists and publishers, they are deprived of their most important and traditional defense – of acting in the public interest – which does not apply under the Espionage Act.</p> <p>Prior to being moved to Belmarsh prison, Mr Assange spent more than a year under house arrest and then seven years inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had been granted political asylum. Throughout this time he was subjected to serious violations of his human rights, including having his legally privileged conversations spied on by organizations taking direct instruction from US agencies. Journalists visiting were subjected to pervasive surveillance. He had restricted access to legal defense and medical care and was deprived of exposure to sunlight and exercise.</p> <p>In April 2019, the Moreno government allowed UK law enforcement officers to enter the Ecuador embassy and seize Mr Assange. Since then he has been held in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day and, according to visitors, is “heavily medicated”. His physical and mental health have seriously deteriorated.</p> <p>As early as 2015 the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) determinedthat Mr Assange was arbitrarily detained and deprived of his liberty, and called for him to be released and paid compensation. In May 2019, the WGAD reiterated its concerns and request for his personal liberty to be restored.</p> <p>We hold the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Ecuador and Sweden accountable for the human rights violations to which Mr Assange has been subjected.</p> <p>Julian Assange has made an outstanding contribution to public interest journalism, transparency and government accountability around the world. He is being singled out and prosecuted for publishing information that should never have been withheld from the public. His work has been recognized by the Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in 2011, the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, the Index on Censorship prize, the Economist’s New Media Award, the Amnesty International New Media Award, the 2019 Gavin MacFadyen Award and many others. WikiLeaks has also been nominated for the UN Mandela Prize in 2015 and for the Nobel Peace Prize seven times (2010-2015, 2019).</p> <p>Mr Assange’s reporting of abuses and crimes is of historic importance, as have been the contributions by whistleblowers Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner, who are now in exile or incarcerated. They have all faced relentless smear campaigns waged by their opponents, campaigns that have often led to erroneous media reports and a lack of scrutiny and media coverage of their predicaments.</p> <p>The systematic abuse of Mr Assange’s rights for the past nine years has been understood and protested by the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists and leading human rights organisations. But in public discussion there has been an insidious normalising of how he has been treated.</p> <p>United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer investigated the case and in June 2019 wrote:</p> <p>“it finally dawned on me that I had been blinded by propaganda, and that Assange had been systematically slandered to divert attention from the crimes he exposed. Once he had been dehumanized through isolation, ridicule and shame, just like the witches we used to burn at the stake, it was easy to deprive him of his most fundamental rights without provoking public outrage worldwide. And thus, a legal precedent is being set, through the backdoor of our own complacency, which in the future can and will be applied just as well to disclosures by The Guardian, the New York Times and ABC News”. “By displaying an attitude of complacency at best, and of complicity at worst, Sweden, Ecuador, UK and US governments have created an atmosphere of impunity encouraging Mr Assange’s uninhibited vilification and abuse. In 20 years of work with victims of war, violence and political persecution I have never seen a group of democratic States ganging up to deliberately isolate, demonize and abuse a single individual for such a long time and with so little regard for human dignity and the rule of law.”</p> <p>In November 2019, Melzer recommended that Mr Assange’s extradition to US be barred and that he be promptly released. “He continues to be detained under oppressive conditions of isolation and surveillance, not justified by his detention status (…) Mr Assange’s continued exposure to arbitrariness and abuse may soon end up costing his life”, said Melzer.</p> <p>In 1898, French writer Émile Zola wrote the open letter J’accuse…! (I accuse) to warn about the wrongful sentencing to life in prison of a military officer named Alfred Dreyfus on espionage charges. Zola’s stance entered history books and still today stands for our duty to fight miscarriages of justice and to hold the powerful to account.</p> <p>This duty is as necessary as ever today, when Julian Assange is being victimized by governments and faces 17 charges[1] under the US Espionage Act, legislation that also dates back over hundred years.</p> <p>As journalists and journalists’ organizations that believe in human rights, freedom of information and of the public’s right to know, we demand the immediate release of Julian Assange.</p> <p>We urge our governments, all national and international agencies and fellow journalists to call for an end to the legal campaign being waged against him for the crime of revealing war crimes.</p> <p>We urge our fellow journalists to inform the public accurately about this abuse of fundamental rights.</p> <p>We urge all journalists to speak up in defense of Julian Assange at this critical time.</p> <p>Dangerous times call for fearless journalism.</p> <p>NOTE:</p> <p>[1] There is a further charge under different legislation, making a total of 18 charges.</p> <p>(Only journalists, organizations and people in journalism-related roles – columnists/commentators, editors, photographers, cameramen and camerawomen, media producers and publishers, documentary filmmakers, whistleblowers, journalism professors/trainers or academics researching journalism and media, representatives of journalism organizations including journalists’ trade unions, and NGOs which defend press freedom, and work in defence of whistleblowers, digital rights and transparency and similar roles – are eligible to sign.)</p> <p>*This article has been posted here from TRANSCEND Media Service (TMS)</p> <p>Share Share</p> <p>Tumblr</p> <p>Twitter</p> <p>Reddit</p> <p>Print</p> <p>LinkedIn</p> <p>Email</p> <p>Facebook</p> <p>Pinterest</p> <p>Pocket</p> <p>Like this: Like Loading...

The OFB has a total workforce of 82,000 and is the 37th largest defence manufacturer in the world.</p> <p>The Modi government claims that the corporatisation is necessary in order to attract investment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government intends to allow up to 74 percent direct foreign investment in the OFB, up from the current 49 percent limit.</p> <p>The protest was called by the All India Defense Employees’ Federation, the Indian National Defense Workers’ Federation and the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh. The unions have threatened to call an indefinite strike if the government does not reverse its decision. A union ballot of OFB workers will take place between June 8 and 17.</p> <p>Power sector workers across India protest against privatisation</p> <p>Thousands of power workers and engineers protested nationally on June 1 against the Modi government’s Electricity Amendment Bill 2020. The bill allows the privatisation of electricity distribution in all India’s states and territories. Workers wore black badges and demonstrated outside depot gates in most states.</p> <p>Workers alleged that the bill is anti-farmer and anti-domestic consumer. Power generation and distribution in India operates via a cross-subsidisation system. Under this scheme richer states that make a profit subsidise the power distribution costs of poorer states and territories ensuring that power prices are kept relatively low.</p> <p>India: Tyre factory workers in Tamil Nadu strike</p> <p>MRF tyre factory workers at Thiruvottiyur in Chennai, Tamil Nadu downed tools on May 28 after a co-worker tested positive for COVID-19. The workers demanded decontamination and sanitation of various departments, systematic contact tracing, testing of all workers and isolation of those showing signs of being infected.</p> <p>The workers also rejected recent management demands that all permanent floor-level technicians report for work. The tyre workers said the management directive was in violation of the government endorsed standard operating procedures and ignored an agreement between management and the union prior to restarting work.</p> <p>Maharashtra hospital workers in walkout over unpaid salaries</p> <p>Around 450 workers at the Kashibai Navale Hospital and Medical College in Pune, Maharashtra state, walked out on May 30 and protested outside the hospital over non-payment of wages of over 1,200 workers for six months.</p> <p>Most of them were non-teaching staff, including nurses, ward boys, multi-purpose workers and lab technicians. Workers from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) facility remained at work during the protest.</p> <p>Hospital management claimed that the pay delays were due to loss of income caused by the coronavirus lockdown. Workers rejected this, pointing out that management often delayed salary payments.</p> <p>Protesters also complained that over 230 hospital workers stranded in the home villages because the national coronavirus lockdown had been terminated by hospital administration.</p> <p>Bangalore construction workers protest</p> <p>Construction workers protested outside the Karnataka State Building and Construction Workers Welfare Board on May 28 to demand 2,000 rupees ($26) per week financial assistance for all construction workers badly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down.</p> <p>Maharashtra garbage truck drivers protest against pay cut</p> <p>Garbage collection service drivers in Nagpur, Maharashtra demonstrated on June 1 against salary cuts that management claimed were the result of economic difficulties caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Workers complained that the company, which is owned by the Bharat Vikas Group India, had paid only 15 days’ wages last month for newly-hired workers. As part of the protest several workers refused to collect garbage and others refused to dump collected garbage.</p> <p>Kerala spice farmers demand government assistance</p> <p>Cardamom spice growers and farm workers in Idukki, Kerala state held a silent protest on May 31, complaining that the state government financial assistance and essential goods were inadequate and was preventing them from harvesting. The farmers told the media that the cardamom plants had been hit by pests and that the government assistance was to allow them to purchase sufficient amounts of pesticides.</p> <p>Bangladeshi water and sewerage utility workers demand job permanency</p> <p>Hundreds of Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA) workers began an indefinite protest outside the WASA building at Karwanbazar in Dhaka on Monday. They were demanding permanent jobs for 1,500 workers hired under the “muster roll” system, payment of COVID-19 risk allowance and doubling of overtime pay rates.</p> <p>Trade union officials accused WASA management of planning to keep the employees permanently on the “muster roll” and said their protest would continue until workers’ demands were met.</p> <p>Bangladesh: Dhaka workers demonstrate against extended hours</p> <p>Hundreds of Tanaz Fashion factory workers in Gazipura in Dhaka, and the Bay Creation factory in Rupganj near Dhaka, demonstrated this week against layoffs and extended working hours but without any extra pay.</p> <p>Both factories were due to reopen on May 30 after the government ended its national coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>However, soon after the Tanaz Fashion workers arrived at the plant on Monday morning management closed the factory and did not pay any of the outstanding wages or allowance.</p> <p>Management simply declared that the workers were sacked and falsely claimed that entitlements for all 3,000 workers had been cleared before the Eid religious festival.</p> <p>Workers rejected this and began blocking the nearby Dhaka-Mymensingh highway. The demonstration ended after the police intervened, claiming that negotiations with management to reopen the factory would be made.</p> <p>On Sunday, Bay Creation workers blocked the Dhaka-Sylhet highway in protest against factory management demanding that they work an extra 150 hours without pay. Police were deployed to the scene but failed to convince workers to end their protest, forcing management to withdraw its demand.</p> <p>Pakistan: Sindh government hospital nurses demonstrate in Karachi</p> <p>Sindh Young Nurses Association members are maintaining a protest they began on International Nurses Day outside the Karachi Press Club on May 12.</p> <p>Government hospital nurses are demanding personal protective equipment (PPE) as COVID-19 infections increase throughout Pakistan and under conditions of a premature lifting of lockdown measures.</p> <p>The nurses’ other demands include implementation of a service structure, timely promotions, the provision of health professional payments and health risk allowances, promotions and benefits for contract-based nurses and compensation to the families of nurses who have died of COVID-19.</p> <p>Malaysian police break up hospital protest</p> <p>About 20 non-medical workers from the HRBT hospital in Ipoh, a city 180 km north of Kuala Lumpur, protested outside the hospital on Tuesday to demand personal protective equipment. Police were mobilised to break up the protest, arresting five workers.</p> <p>Workers complained that their employer, Edgenta UEMS, forced them to clean COVID-19 wards without supplying them with PPE. They were also protesting over victimisation of union activists through arbitrary changes to their hours and shifts or transferring them to distant hospitals.</p> <p>While the protest was conducted in accordance with COVID-19 procedures, the five workers were arrested under a 1988 prevention of infectious diseases law and the Criminal Procedures Code. Three of those arrested were hospital union office holders and two were members of Malaysian Socialist Party.</p> <p>Australia</p> <p>Airport workers protest in Australian capital cities</p> <p>Laid-off aviation workers demonstrated at all of Australia’s major airports on Thursday to demand JobKeeper COVID-19 welfare payments. The Transport Workers Union (TWU), which covers the workers and organised the protests, called on the federal Liberal-National government to reverse its decision to exclude workers at foreign-owned companies from the $1,500 fortnightly JobKeeper subsidy. Over 5,000 workers are affected by the government decision.</p> <p>According to a recent survey of over 1,000 aviation workers, almost 40 percent have had no income since being stood down; 70 percent said they were worried about losing their position permanently; 30 percent had been forced to use their superannuation to cover living expenses and 20 percent said they were worried they might default on mortgages and lose their home.</p> <p>The TWU and other unions covering these destitute workers have refused to call industrial action by other airline industry workers. Instead all action is restricted to irregular protests at airports or outside the offices of federal government ministers and mouse-like appeals to the government.</p>",4
962128154,U.S. demands release of Uighur doctor while China urges halt to smears,2020-12-31 01:25:12,"<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States called on Wednesday for the release of a Uighur Muslim medical doctor whose relatives say she was sentenced to 20 years in jail in China because of family members’ human rights activism in the United States.</p> <p>FILE PHOTO: A Chinese police officer takes his position by the road near what is officially called a vocational education centre in Yining in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China September 4, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas Peter</p> <p>The daughter of Gulshan Abbas told a briefing organized with the bipartisan U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) that the family had recently learned her mother received the sentence in March last year on terrorism-related charges after disappearing in September 2018.</p> <p>In Beijing on Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesman said Abbas was sentenced for the crimes of joining a terrorist organization, helping terrorist activities, and “assembling a crowd to disrupt social order”.</p> <p>“We urge certain politicians in the United States to respect facts and stop fabricating lies and smearing China,” the spokesman, Wang Wenbin, told a news conference.</p> <p>The daughter, Ziba Murat, called the charges “preposterous.” Gulshan’s sister, Rushan Abbas, said they stemmed from activism by her and her brother Rishat Abbas, both of whom are based in the United States.</p> <p>“We have committed to working to defend our people’s rights and advocate for justice, and now our sister is denied justice as a punishment,” Rushan said.</p> <p>In a tweet, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, Robert Destro, said Gulshan Abbas must be released.</p> <p>“Her forcible disappearance, detainment and harsh sentencing by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is evidence of a family suffering the consequences of speaking out against a government that has no respect for human rights,” he said.</p> <p>Ziba Murat said she could not reveal the source of the information on the sentencing to protect their identity. “We only learned that she is sentenced to 20 years, and we’re trying to get more information.”</p> <p>“My mom is a medical professional, non-political, kind person who has spent her life helping people,” she said, adding that her mother was in fragile health and suffered from multiple conditions, including high blood pressure.</p> <p>The CECC chairman, Democratic Representative James McGovern, called the punishment of an innocent family member in what he said was an attempt to silence free expression “morally reprehensible.”</p> <p>He said it was just part of a “mass persecution” of Uighurs in China that has involved detention of as many as 1.8. million in internment camps, forced labor and other abuses.</p> <p>U.N. experts and advocates say at least a million ethnic Uighurs have been detained at some point in camps in China’s Xinjiang region.</p> <p>China calls the heavily guarded centers educational and vocational institutes, and says all those who attended have “graduated” and gone home. Access to the camps is restricted and it is not possible to independently verify whether all have closed.</p>",4
1030939327,Nigeria’s pandemic lockdown measures were hard on informal workers,2022-02-28 14:32:30,"<p>During the first wave of the pandemic in Nigeria, security forces were mandated to enforce lockdown and stay-at-home orders. Intended as public health measures, these controls inflicted collateral damage.</p> <p>The damage included arrests and detention, harassment, extrajudicial killings, destruction of wares, maiming and torture. The controls also trampled on the human rights and economic rights of workers in the informal economy.</p> <p>Nigeria’s informal economy accounts for 65% of the country’s total GDP and employs more than 90% of the workforce.</p> <p>About 5.58 million people 2.38 million men and 3.2 million women – make a living in the informal economy of Lagos. This represents about three quarters of the State’s 7.5 million labour force.</p> <p>These estimates show that a large percentage of Nigeria’s population depends on the informal economy for their livelihood. It follows that the adverse impact of the COVID-19 control measures on informal workers would be huge. The measures are hard on informal workers because they tend to need to work outside the home every day.</p> <p>Our research focused on violations of human rights of informal workers in Nigeria by state actors. We call for an approach to pandemic control that recognises the nuances of local cultures and social economy.</p> <p>Studying the state’s actions</p> <p>We sourced data from the WHO, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control publications portal, policy documents of the Nigerian government, journal and newspaper articles, blog posts from press briefings and media interviews of government officials.</p> <p>During the lockdown, movements were restricted and we couldn’t conduct face-to-face interviews and surveys. Thus we relied on a desk review of literature on COVID-19 control responses.</p> <p>At the onset of the first wave of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the government declared a state of emergency. It directed state actors, including security agencies, to take measures necessary to maintain law and order and protect citizens’ lives and property. They were also asked to keep essential public services working, and direct relief materials to the areas of greatest need. State actors enforced restrictions on movement and travel, bans on public gatherings, and closure of markets, businesses and schools.</p> <p>Despite the warning by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that states should not violate human rights under the guise of exceptional or emergency measures, some actions of Nigerian security agencies violated the rights of informal workers. Of particular concern were those whose survival depends on daily earnings from outside the home. These include street vendors, petty traders, artisans, cart pushers, waste pickers, commercial motorcycle operators, and roadside motor mechanics.</p> <p>The pandemic and the related containment measures worsened various forms of social, cultural and economic exclusion and inequality. This strongly affected vulnerable groups like informal workers.</p> <p>Some states in Nigeria such as Abia, Ekiti, Lagos, Kaduna and Rivers recorded incidents of abuse such as destruction of traders’ wares by security operatives enforcing the lockdown policy. Cases were reported where security agencies were implicated in harassment, killings, maiming and torture.</p> <p>Public transport services were shut down, leading to loss of income. Informal workers were left with little option than to walk long distances between their homes and places of work. Many who dared to move around were harassed and arrested by the security agencies. These impacts have been captured in media reports.</p> <p>The lockdown policy severely reduced income-generating activities for informal workers and presented the dilemma of either ‘dying from the virus or dying from hunger’.</p> <p>Nigeria has a Bill of Rights, and these rights are contained in Chapter IV of the 1999 constitution. They include the right to life, right to dignity, right to personal liberty, right to freedom of movement, and right to freedom of assembly and association. State actors violated these rights under lockdown.</p> <p>How state actors got it wrong</p> <p>While the Nigeria Police issued some guidelines on enforcement of COVID-19 control measures, it left room for discretionary use of force.</p> <p>The guidelines prescribed “use of force when absolutely necessary and to the extent proportionate to achieve the required result and in accordance with existing national legislation.” They didn’t consider the daily income earners who cannot survive without leaving their homes. Consequently, many Nigerians who obeyed the COVID-19 lockdown policy did not have food and income that their families needed.</p> <p>The lockdown also closed schools and disrupted students’ education. While the children of the elite took online lessons and used digital platforms for learning, the children of informal workers had no such opportunity.</p> <p>COVID-19 containment programmes raised important legal, constitutional and human rights concerns.</p> <p>What we suggest</p> <p>Any future lockdown strategies must consider the risks to both lives and livelihoods. Approaches like lockdown and stay-at-home orders may not benefit societies dominated by informal economies.</p> <p>We argue that the enforcement of COVID-19 containment policies in Nigeria neglected social structures and the way the local economy works. It undermined the human rights of informal workers who depend on daily social interactions for their livelihood.</p> <p>The nuances of culture also should be taken into consideration before large scale adoption of these control practices. And security agents need training on human rights as part of effective implementation of COVID-19 containment measures in Nigeria.</p>",4

His native Turkish flag is almost identical, but features a red background.</p> <p>It was not clear whether or not the athlete had been making a political statement, or was an unwitting hero to some due to the colour of his skis.</p> <p>On Sunday, Ipcioglu used plain blue skis without the flag, and would not discuss the issue when asked by Reuters. “I don’t want to answer those questions,” he said.</p> <p>“I changed my skis, these are my competition skis… I try my best and we will see. I showed my jump under the Turkish flag.</p> <p>“I can just speak about the Turkish flag,” he said, when asked if the skis on Saturday had featured the Turkish flag or an East Turkestan flag.</p> <p>When asked if he had been making a political statement, the athlete said: “Like I said, I am a sportsman, I just do my job. The other things I don’t care about, it’s not my job. I don’t want to answer those questions.”</p> <p>Uyghur advocates and sympathisers on social media were quick to jump on the issue.</p> <p>“The first Turk to qualify in ski jumping, Fatih Arda Ipcioglu competed with the East Turkestan flag on his helmet and skis, protesting the Chinese persecution in China,” said Twitter user Bulent Aksoy. “Congratulations Fatih Arda.”</p> <p>Another, Mustafa Karadeniz, said “Fatih Arda Ipcioglu participated in the competitions with the flag of East Turkestan in the heart of China. Thank you my brave brother.”</p> <p>The display of any political symbol or unofficial flag is strictly forbidden at the Olympics.</p> <p>Neither the IOC nor the Turkish Olympic team were immediately available for comment.</p> <p>China’s Xinjiang region is home to a Muslim Uyghur minority. Hundreds of protesters from China’s Muslim Uyghur community had rallied in Turkey’s Istanbul on Friday to call for a boycott of the Beijing Games and to urge participants to speak out against China’s treatment of the ethnic minority.</p> <p>Some 50,000 Uyghurs are estimated to live in Turkey, the largest Uyghur diaspora outside Central Asia. Turks have close ethnic, religious and linguistic ties to the Uyghurs.</p> <p>U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly from the Uyghur and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in forced labour camps in Xinjiang since 2016.</p> <p>After initially denying such camps existed, China has since said they are vocational centres and are designed to combat extremism. It denies all accusations of human rights abuses.</p> <p>(Editing by Hugh Lawson)</p>",4
929157631,Cops bust White Wolf's Black Lives Matter rally,2020-06-12 17:07:00+08:00,"<p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A protest rally led by a former Taiwanese gang leader and pro-China figure on Friday (June 12) to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement was cut short by police, as they said he did not have the proper permits.</p> <p>Chinese Unity Promotion Party (CUPP, 統促黨) head Chang An-le (張安樂), aka the ""White Wolf,"" on his Facebook page on Monday (June 8) wrote: ""In order to protest against the serious violation of human rights and provoking of ethnic antagonism by the U.S. government, the Chinese Unity Promotion Party will issue a solemn statement. We sincerely invite people with lofty ideals to participate in the grand event and join us in enforcing justice on behalf of heaven.""</p> <p>However, members of the Facebook group ""辣台派挺蔡英文"" condemned Chang's rally as a ploy by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to take advantage of racial tensions in the U.S.</p> <p>At 9:30 a.m. on Friday morning, Chang and his pack of blue-vested followers gathered at a street corner diagonally across from the new American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in Taipei City's Neihu District. Just as Chang and his pack members were ready to start their rally at 10 a.m., they found themselves surrounded by 150 police officers.</p> <p>At the scene, participants could be heard chanting ""human rights are priceless,"" hoisting banners that showed images of George Floyd and the words ""Black Lives Matter"" and another sign saying, ""Okinawan Lives Matter."" People dressed in the regalia of Taiwan's indigenous tribes could be seen standing behind posters listing ""political prisoners"" who have been imprisoned in the U.S. since the 1970s.</p> <p>Chang appeared at the scene at 10:05 a.m. decked out in an all-black Zhongshan suit. However, just as he was beginning to start his speech, police interrupted him and held up a sign informing him that he was engaging in an illegal assembly and that this was his first warning to disperse.</p> <p>Chang An-le (Facebook, CUPP photo)</p> <p>Shrugging off the police warning, Chang continued with his speech, saying that out of the 1,000 civilians shot by police in the U.S. each year, 30 percent are black males, yet they only comprise 6 percent of the population. He pointed out the U.S. has only 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of the world's incarcerated individuals.</p> <p>Chang also noted that while African Americans make up 12 percent of the population of the U.S., black American men comprise 45 percent of the prison population. In addition, Chang said the U.S. has ""political prisoners"" such as American indigenous rights activist Leonard Peltier, and former Black Panther Party member Sundiata Acoli, both of whom have been imprisoned for over 40 years.</p> <p>The former gangster said the U.S. preaches about human rights but ""only talks about others and forgets itself."" Citing the Native Americans as an example, Chang said, ""How does the United States reward Indians on Thanksgiving? Massacre and encroachment on the land — a lot of land in the United States was stolen.""</p> <p>He then called on the U.S. to respect the rights and interests of the people of the Ryukyu Islands. He said the U.S. has set up a base on Ryukyu (Okinawa) to deal with China but that ""If war erupts between China and the U.S., I don't know how many innocent Ryukyu people will be killed in a relentless fiery sea of missiles.""</p> <p>Chang gives speech. (Facebook, Chang An-le photo)</p> <p>Police then waved a sign in front of him saying it was his second warning to disperse. Unlike the previous warning, the wording of the date on the sign did not include the words ""Republic of China."" Livid, Chang howled, ""If you are not Republic of China police, I will not listen to you. If you are not the Republic of China police, why should I listen?""</p> <p>He then threatened to report the police for treason and admonished them to ""go back and look in the mirror."" He then growled, ""You don't dare to admit you are a citizen of the Republic of China. What gives you the right to stand here?""</p> <p>Chang then issued one parting shot: ""You didn't swear to uphold the Constitution? Scum,"" before turning tail and beating a hasty retreat. Chang and his troupe dismantled their banners and dispersed at 10:30 a.m.</p> <p>The CUPP is a pro-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organization in Taiwan, and its mission is to promote the CCP and Taiwan's unification with China. The party actively promotes the ""one country, two systems"" framework and can often be seen waving the flag of communist China, causing many public disturbances over the years with its aggressive protesting tactics.</p> <p>One of the more memorable incidents was when Chang brought a coffin to the Legislative Yuan to protest what he perceived to be Premier Su Tseng-chang's (蘇貞昌) willingness to fight to the last man in a war with China. However, his political stunt went awry during a scuffle with police when he accidentally fell into the coffin.</p>",4

The nomination of new national leaders provides an invaluable opportunity for Viet Nam to change course on human rights,” said Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director.</p> <p>According to Article 4 of Viet Nam’s Constitution the CPV leads “the State and society”. This provision has been relied upon to outlaw other political parties.</p> <p>As Viet Nam increasingly opens to global trade, its prison gates are slamming shut on an ever-rising number of peaceful individuals. Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Regional Director</p> <p>The CPV congress – which occurs every five years – is the key mechanism by which government leaders are selected and policy priorities are set. It involves the nomination of new party leaders who are later formally appointed to government leadership positions by the National Assembly. The CPV has been in government since its victory in the Viet Nam War in April 1975.</p> <p>“Viet Nam has made some strides in helping to realize economic and social rights for many of its people, but this progress has been severely undermined by its continued repression of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.</p> <p>“As Viet Nam increasingly opens to global trade, its prison gates are slamming shut on an ever-rising number of peaceful individuals.”</p> <p>Surge in prisoners of conscience in five years since last party congress</p> <p>Amnesty International currently recognizes 170 prisoners of conscience in Viet Nam. This is the highest number recorded by the organization since it began publishing comparable figures in 1996.</p> <p>The number of prisoners of conscience has increased steeply in recent years and has doubled from 84 in the year of the previous CPV congress in 2016.</p> <p>Prisoners of conscience are individuals who have been detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights. Amnesty International calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience wrongfully detained in Viet Nam and throughout the world.</p> <p>Crackdown ahead of upcoming congress</p> <p>The recent conviction and heavy sentencing of three journalists and prisoners of conscience affiliated with the Independent Journalists Association of Viet Nam (IJAVN) – Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy and Le Huu Minh Tuan– by the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Court on 5 January 2021 is the latest violation of freedom of expression in a months-long escalation of repression.</p> <p>The three journalists were convicted under Article 117 of the Criminal Code for “making, storing or spreading information, materials or items for the purpose of opposing the State of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam”.Pham Chi Dung was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, and Nguyen Tuong Thuy and Le Huu Minh Tuan each received 11-year sentences.</p> <p>Article 117 is commonly used to suppress legitimate dissent in Viet Nam and has been a favoured tool of the authorities to arbitrarily imprison journalists, bloggers and others who express views that do not align with the interests of the CPV.</p> <p>Today, Viet Nam is one of the most dangerous countries in the region to be a human rights defender, journalist, blogger or political activist. Yamini Mishra</p> <p>Pham Chi Dung, the founder of IJAVN, was arrested on 21 November 2019, days after he signed a letter urging the European Union (EU) to delay approval of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) until Viet Nam took measures to improve its respect for human rights. Nguyen Tuong Thuy and Le Huu Minh Tuan were arrested on 23 May 2020 and 12 June 2020, respectively.</p> <p>“These outrageous sentences reveal the Vietnamese authorities’ zero-tolerance approach to dissent. Today, Viet Nam is one of the most dangerous countries in the region to be a human rights defender, journalist, blogger or political activist,” said Yamini Mishra.</p> <p>The convictions follow the arbitrary arrest of prominent human rights defender, journalist and author Pham Doan Trang in October 2020. She was also charged under Article 117 and remains in pre-trial detention.</p> <p>High time to repeal or amend repressive laws</p> <p>At least 36 people have been detained under Article 117 since the 2015 Criminal Code came into force in January 2018 – eight in 2018, 14 in 2019 and 14 in 2020. Those convicted have received sentences ranging from five to 15 years’ imprisonment.</p> <p>In addition to Article 117 of the Criminal Code, Article 331 (“abusing democratic freedoms to infringe the interests of the State”) is another common charge used by authorities to repress its people.</p> <p>Among the 23 people who have been charged under Article 331 since the 2015 Criminal Code took effect, 15 have so far been convicted and sentenced to prison terms of between six months and five years. At least nine people were charged under Article 331 in 2018 alone, another five were detained on the same charge in 2019 and nine were charged in 2020.</p> <p>Both Article 117 and 331 violate Viet Nam’s international human rights obligations and should be repealed or substantially amended to comply with the rules set out under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Viet Nam is a state party, and other standards. Other laws that unduly restrict freedom of expression should also be repealed or substantially amended, including the vaguely worded and excessively punitive Law on Cybersecurity.</p> <p>In its most recent review of Viet Nam in 2019, the UN Human Rights Committee, the body tasked with monitoring the implementation of the ICCPR, stated that Viet Nam’s “domestic legal framework remains incompatible with the Covenant” and highlighted Articles 117 and 331 of the Criminal Code in addition to the Law on Cybersecurity for their non-compliance with the requirements of the Covenant.</p> <p>Big Tech must end complicity in Viet Nam’s censorship regime</p> <p>Viet Nam has long maintained strict censorship of the press, yet the expansion of social media in recent years has significantly opened up the space for public debate and the exchange of ideas and opinions among the general public.</p> <p>As documented in Amnesty International’s December 2020 report, ‘Let Us Breathe!’: Censorship and criminalization of online expression in Viet Nam, this technological revolution has led Viet Nam’s censors and security forces to unleash a major crackdown on online expression.</p> <p>A large and growing proportion of prisoners of conscience in Viet Nam are imprisoned based on their expression online, with 41% of those recognized by Amnesty International behind bars because of peaceful online speech.</p> <p>In addition to imprisoning people based on their social media posts, Vietnamese authorities have increasingly enlisted tech giants Facebook and YouTube to implement censorship on their behalf.</p> <p>“With these impending changes in national leadership, both the Vietnamese authorities and big tech have a chance to reset their approach. They must protect online expression in line with international human rights law and standards,” said Yamini Mishra.</p> <p>Longstanding human rights concerns must be addressed</p> <p>Viet Nam has a long and pressing list of human rights concerns which require urgent remedial action by the incoming party and government leadership.</p> <p>The country still imposes the death penalty and undertakes executions in violation of the right to life. Amnesty International reiterates the organization’s longstanding call for this ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishmentto be abolished in Viet Nam and everywhere.</p> <p>Ethnic and religious minorities also continue to face serious discrimination on the basis of their ethnic and religious identities and perceived political beliefs. Violence against women and girls, and in particular intimate partner violence, remains a serious and widespread concern.</p> <p>“In setting policy for the coming five years, the CPV must set its sights on meeting international human rights standards. From the death penalty, to women’s rights, to the arbitrary prosecution of freedom of expression, this is a time to correct course where current policy is causing suffering and injustice,” said Yamini Mishra.</p>",4

887981182,Arizona border activist found not guilty of hiding migrants,2019-11-20 22:57:38,"<p>TUCSON, Ariz. (Reuters) - An Arizona jury on Wednesday found a human rights activist not guilty of harboring two migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, after the U.S. government prosecuted him for giving them food, water and shelter in the desert.</p> <p>FILE PHOTO: A yard sign in support of ""No Más Muertes/No More Deaths"" is displayed in the neighborhood surrounding the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, where humanitarian volunteer Scott Warren faces charges of harboring, and conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants in Tucson, Arizona, U.S. May 29, 2019. REUTERS/Caitlin O'Hara/File Photo</p> <p>The Tucson jury took just over two hours to decide that Scott Warren, 37, a geography professor, provided the men with legal humanitarian aid in January 2018 and did not deliberately conceal them from U.S. Border Patrol.</p> <p>An overjoyed Warren hugged supporters who stuck with him through two federal trials. A previous jury was unable to decide whether he broke the law by letting the men stay in a building near Ajo, Arizona, to recover from a two-day trek.</p> <p>“I love you all,” Warren told his defense team and members of his group No More Deaths (NMD), which leaves water in the desert for migrants. “To those in the desert working on water drops and other aid, I love you too.”</p> <p>Warren’s case was supported by United Nations officials and Amnesty International who said he was being persecuted for providing aid in the midst of a humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>The case was an indicator of what assistance humanitarian workers can give undocumented migrants as President Donald Trump makes tougher immigration enforcement a major re-election theme following a surge in apprehensions earlier this year.</p> <p>Prosecutors accused Warren of shielding the men from the U.S. Border Patrol and giving them directions while they stayed at the ramshackle wooden building known as “The Barn” Jan. 14-17, 2018.</p> <p>Border Patrol agents had The Barn under surveillance and said that Warren at one point walked outside with the two men and gestured to the north to show them where to go.</p> <p>“We’re disappointed in the verdict and we have a lot of work to do to keep prosecuting immigration cases,” said Michael Bailey, U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona.</p> <p>Warren was arrested on Jan. 17, 2018, at the building in desert around 103 miles (166 km) west of Tucson.</p> <p>His lawyers said the arrest was in retaliation for a viral video that NMD released the same day showing U.S. Border Patrol agents destroying water supplies it left in the desert.</p> <p>The two migrants, Kristian Perez-Villanueva, then 23, and Jose Arnaldo Sacaria-Goday, 20, from El Salvador and Honduras respectively, crossed the border and walked nearly 30 miles through the desert before sheltering in the building.</p> <p>Warren gave the men medical checks, finding both had blisters and scratches, with Sacaria-Goday showing cold-like symptoms and complaining of a bruised upper torso. He said the men needed to recover rather than continue their journey through desert where “people are dying from exposure.”</p> <p>“We are so grateful that Scott Warren is free,” said Juanita Molina, a Tucson human rights activist who runs the Border Action Network group. “Criminalizing humanitarian aid is against our values as a community.”</p> <p>Since 2001 the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner has identified more than 3,000 sets of human remains suspected of belonging to migrants who died in the deserts of southern Arizona.</p>",4

907016226,Jounralists are tyring to take over the government in Cross River,2020-02-19 12:15:28,"<p>Agba Jalingo, one of several journalists and prisoners of conscience, was released on bail on Cross River State yesterday after spending five months in detention on charges of treason, treasonable felony and threatening through various publications on his media platform Cross River Watch and using malicious publications to instigate Nigerians to stage protests for the removal of the Governor of Cross River, Governor Benedict Ayade, from office without due process.</p> <p>This comes after another blogger and lecturer, Joseph Odok, was arrested and detained on the order of the Cross River State government. The terms set for Odok’s bail, after spending a few days in prison, included bond valued at N10m with two sureties. Just like Agba Jalingo, Odok was charged with terrorism and cyber-crime for publishing a post on Facebook. Governor Ayade’s spokesperson, Christian Ita, denied the governor’s involvement.</p> <p>There are two other pending cases against journalists in Cross River, either instituted by the Nigerian Police or the state government (although denied). Two other journalists, Jonathan Ugbal and Jeremiah, are also standing trial on treason charges after criticising the state governor, Ben Ayade. Both are news editor and managing editor respectively for CrossRiverWatch, the same online newspaper owned by Mr. Jalingo. If found guilty, these journalists could be sentenced to death.</p> <p>While the state government charged Jalingo with terrorism and conspiracy to remove an elected governor through nefarious activities, a copy of the police invitation letter subsequently revealed that he was summoned because he was mentioned in an investigation of “Conspiracy to cause Unrest and Conduct likely to Cause Breach of Peace, which was reported by the Cross River Microfinance Bank”.</p> <p>Before his arrest, Cross RiverWatch had published a story alleging that the governor had diverted N500million from the state funds, a claim refuted by the government. Paul Ifere, another critic of Mr. Ayade’s administration, was similarly arrested and detained last year for criticising Mr. Ayade.</p> <p>Nigeria is currently ranked 120th among countries with the highest level of Press Freedom by Reporters Without Borders (RWB), on the list with 180 countries. However, Cape Verde tops the list of African countries with the 25th position, as it is said to have one of the freest media environments in both Africa. Since the 1990s, Cape Verde, with a population of almost 500,000 people, a literacy rate of 71.6 percent, and with 30 percent of its citizens below the poverty line, has been one of the most developed and democratic African countries with a stable representative democracy.</p> <p>On the other hand, Nigeria has over 100 independent newspapers, and issues continue to arise when journalists report on politics, terrorism, or financial embezzlement by the powerful. Section 39 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution protects the freedom of expression, but the supposed democratic leaders continue to operate as a military junta, continually devising ways to limit every form of rights as recognised in any democracy.</p> <p>Speaking during an interview in January, Governor Ayade explained that the Jalingo, a man standing trial for treason, and could be sent to death for allegedly criticising his government, “acted out of youthful exuberance.” The level of disregard for human life, rights, and justice captured in the statement says a lot about state government led by one of the most educated governors in Nigeria.</p> <p>Denying that he ordered the journalist’s arrest, the governor said, “If you ask Agba Jalingo today, I am the one working with his lawyers for his freedom, I am the one sustaining him and sending upkeeps.” But somehow, popular critics of the governor are arrested for treason and kept in detention.</p> <p>Although these journalists are currently on bail, these court cases are not over. On 7 February 2019, the state’s Attorney General, Tanko Ashang, confirmed that the state government would take over the prosecution of Jalingo and that a letter to that effect had been filed in the Federal High Court in Calabar. The government could drag these cases as long as it wants, all in the urge to bankrupt, embarrass and punish these journalists, all because they criticised their state government. What else determines a healthy democracy, but by how free citizens can share their opinions without being attacked?</p> <p>Governments, either at the federal or state level, have adopted treason charges and its promise of death or life imprisonment as a means to stifle criticism and civic engagement. No voter or any Nigerian can afford to let that happen. Citizens have the right to hold any government accountable, and it is absurd for any leader to assume that it will always be right on every point.</p> <p>From the Social Media Bill and the Hate Speech Bill, to rampant killings by security agents, it appears the urge by political leaders to trample on their citizens is never-ending. We do not operate an ideal democratic government in Nigeria, where the abuse of power and human right is clearly rampant.</p> <p>Our justice system is fundamentally flawed, with the judgments and pronouncements clearly favouring those in seats of power or wealth. If Nigerians can learn any lesson from their detention, it is the assurance that the trial will not be the fairest ever seen in the country. With the threats hanging over their heads for basically exercising their civil rights, they deserve support in every form.</p>",4

He survived the attack.</p> <p>TT said it was clear to the prosecution that the man attacked Abdurakhmanov and that the woman had started a relationship with Abdurakhmanov in order to facilitate the attack and allow the attacker to enter the apartment.</p> <p>The blogger’s lawyer, Jens Sjölund, told the Swedish broadcaster SVT that his client had hoped for a longer sentence because he feared he might be attacked again.</p> <p>In a separate statement, Daniel Stenling, head of the Swedish security police’s counterintelligence unit, said in “the last five years, other countries’ activities and operations on Sweden have intensified”.</p> <p>He added that the police unit “has previously noted how other countries act to undermine fundamental human rights and freedoms in Sweden. Through persecution, threats and even attempted murder, people are forced to refrain from expressing their opinions.”</p> <p>Moscow has relied on Kadyrov to stabilise Chechnya after two separatist wars and has run the predominantly Muslim region as his personal fiefdom, relying on its feared security forces to enforce his rule and quash dissent. International human rights groups have accused Chechen authorities of abductions, torture and killings of their opponents.</p> <p>The Chechen leader has rejected allegations of involvement in attacks on his critics abroad, claiming that they were performed by foreign spies to compromise him and tarnish Russia’s image.</p> <p>The court said the two people convicted must also jointly pay damages to the victim of 140,000 kronor (£16,960) plus interest.</p>",4

895514516,Morocco: Free Outspoken Journalist Jailed Over Tweet,2019-12-28 00:00:00,"<p>Click to expand Image Journalist Omar Radi in Casablanca, Morocco, 2018.  Fanny Hedenmo  Fanny Hedenmo</p> <p>(Tunis, December 28, 2019) – Moroccan authorities should unconditionally release and drop charges against a journalist jailed for a 9 months-old tweet criticizing a judge, Human Rights Watch said today. Omar Radi, 33, is due to be tried on January 2, 2020 for allegedly insulting a judge who imposed heavy penalties on protesters from the Rif region. He faces up to one year in prison if convicted.</p> <p>On December 26, a judge in Casablanca rejected Radi’s request for pretrial release, notably on medical grounds that he suffers a severe form of asthma and other ailments.</p> <p>“Criticizing officials is protected speech and no one should face prison time for peacefully doing so,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Moroccan authorities should immediately free Omar Radi and drop their case against him, which reeks of political vengeance against his critical journalism and activism.”</p> <p>Radi, an award-winning investigative journalist, published several articles about the corruption of officials, and collaborated with various international media as a local correspondent or stringer. Radi is also a social and economic rights activist who has been active in various nongovernmental organizations, notably defending freedom of the press and land rights. He was vice president of Attac Maroc, the local branch of an anti-globalization organization that promotes civic action in response to perceived excesses of global capitalism. He recently described to the Committee to Protect Journalists the “climate of pervasive surveillance and harassment” faced by Moroccan journalists.</p> <p>On April 6, Radi tweeted “Let us all remember Appeals Judge Lahcen Tolfi, the enforcer against our brothers. In many regimes, small-time henchmen like him come back begging, later, claiming they were only ‘carrying out orders.’ No forgetting or forgiveness with such undignified officials!” Radi tweeted this minutes after an appeals court, presided by Tolfi, upheld the trial court’s verdicts against the leaders of largely peaceful protests in the Rif region, who were sentenced in June 2018 to up to 20 years in prison, largely based on statements that they said were made under police torture.</p> <p>On April 16, police in Casablanca summoned Radi and interrogated him for four hours about a series of tweets he posted, criticizing a magazine feature profiling Judge Tolfi that Radi found overly favorable. The police did not contact Radi again until December 25, when they sent him a new summons. When he reported the next morning at 9 a.m., the police transported him to the office of a prosecutor in the Ain Sebaa Court in Casablanca. At 1 p.m., the prosecutor began questioning Radi in the company of his four lawyers. One of them, Omar Bendjelloun, told Human Rights Watch that the 30-minute session revolved solely around the single April 6 tweet about Judge Tolfi. At around 2 p.m., the prosecutor charged Radi with “insulting a magistrate” under penal code article 263 and ordered his detention and immediate referral to trial. Radi was taken to a cell in the basement of the courthouse. His trial started at 6 p.m. Human Rights Watch attended the trial session.</p> <p>The defense immediately requested a postponement of the case and Radi’s provisional release. The prosecutor argued that detention was necessary because of unspecified “exceptional circumstances” that he said surrounded Radi’s case. The judge rejected the petition for provisional release and ordered Radi’s transfer to Oukacha prison in Casablanca. The next trial session is scheduled for January 2.</p> <p>Article 263 of Morocco’s penal code punishes with one month to one year in prison and a fine to “whoever, with the intention of damaging their honor, their delicacy or the respect due to their authority, shows contempt to … a magistrate.”</p> <p>Morocco has been a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) since 1979. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors state compliance with the ICCPR, stated in its general comment on the right to freedom of expression that the “mere fact that forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify the imposition of penalties.” Thus, “all public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority … are legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition.”</p> <p>In the past two months, Morocco has arrested, jailed, or sentenced a rapper, two YouTube commentators, and a student who posted the lyrics of a critical rap song on Facebook. One of the YouTube commentators was sentenced to four years in prison, the student to three years.</p> <p>“Radi’s unjustified detention and trial comes amidst an increasingly suffocating atmosphere for Moroccan journalists, dissidents, and artists who speak out on social media,” Whitson said. “If you express your dissatisfaction of the government on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter, you risk jail in Morocco. Not great for a country that still postures as a ‘liberal exception’ in the Arab world.”</p>",4
951297916,"World press freedom endangered, if UK extradites Julian Assange to America",2020-10-12 00:00:00,"<p>Assange Faces Extradition for Exposing US War Crimes, BY Marjorie Cohn, Truthout, October 11, 2020 Three weeks of testimony in Julian Assange’s extradition hearing in London underscored WikiLeaks’s extraordinary revelation of U.S. war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay. But the Trump administration is seeking to extradite Assange to the United States to stand trial for charges under the Espionage Act that could cause him to spend 175 years in prison.</p> <p>Assange founded WikiLeaks during the Bush administration’s “war on terror,” which was used as a pretext to start two illegal wars and carry out a widespread program of torture and abuse of prisoners at Guantánamo and the CIA black sites. On October 8, 2011, Assange told a Stop the War Coalition rally in London’s Trafalgar Square, “If wars can be started by lies, peace can be started by truth.”</p> <p>In 2010 and 2011, WikiLeaks published classified material that Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning had provided to the organization. Manning was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking the documents. As he left office, Barack Obama commuted her sentence to the seven years she had already served. That commutation provoked “tremendous anger” in the Trump administration and drew Trump’s attention to Assange, Eric Lewis testified. Lewis, chairman of the board of Reprieve U.S. and lawyer for Guantánamo and Afghan detainees, called this “a politically motivated prosecution.”</p> <p>The files that WikiLeaks published contained 90,000 reports about the war in Afghanistan, including the Afghan War Logs, which documented a greater number of civilian casualties by coalition forces than the U.S. military had reported.</p> <p>In addition, WikiLeaks published nearly 400,000 field reports about the Iraq War, more than 15,000 unreported deaths of Iraqi civilians, and the systematic murder, torture and rape by the Iraqi army and authorities that were ignored by U.S. forces.</p> <p>WikiLeaks also published the Guantánamo Files, 779 secret reports constituting evidence of the U.S. government’s abuse of approximately 800 men and boys, ages 14 to 89. That abuse violated the Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p> <p>Perhaps the most notorious release by WikiLeaks was the 2007 “Collateral Murder” video, which depicts a U.S. Army Apache helicopter target and fire on unarmed civilians in Baghdad. At least 18 civilians were killed, including two Reuters reporters and a man who came to rescue the wounded. Two children were injured. A U.S. Army tank drove over one of the bodies, cutting it in half. The video contained evidence of three separate war crimes prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and the U.S. Army Field Manual.</p> <p>As they are firing on the civilians, U.S. gunmen can be heard saying, “Look at those dead bastards.” In his written testimony, investigative journalist Nicky Hager drew a parallel between the Collateral Murder video and the television image of George Floyd screaming “I can’t breathe.”</p> <p>Assange Cannot Be Extradited for a Political Offense</p> <p>The 2003 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty forbids extradition for a political offense. Although the treaty doesn’t define “political offense,” it generally includes espionage, treason, sedition and crimes against state power. Trump is asking the U.K. to extradite Assange for exposing war crimes. This is a classic political offense. Assange is charged under the Espionage Act and espionage constitutes a political offense as well………..</p> <p>Assange’s Prosecution Violates Freedom of Press</p> <p>While the Obama administration declined to file criminal charges against Assange for fear of setting a dangerous precedent, Team Trump demonstrated no such forbearance. By charging Assange under the Espionage Act, Trump is making him a poster boy for its full court press against the media, which he calls “the enemy of the people.” Assange’s prosecution would send an ominous message to all journalists: report the unvarnished truth at your peril.</p> <p>No media outlet or journalist has ever been prosecuted under the Espionage Act for publishing truthful information, which is protected First Amendment activity. Journalists are permitted to publish material that was illegally obtained by a third person and is a matter of public concern. The U.S. government has never prosecuted a journalist or newspaper for publishing classified information, an essential tool of journalism.</p> <p>Information-gathering, reporting and disclosure fit the classic definition of activity protected by the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of the press. There is no distinction between what WikiLeaks did and what The New York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, El País and The Guardian did as well. They all published articles based on documents WikiLeaks released. This is the reason Obama administration — which prosecuted an enormous number of whistleblowers — considered, but refrained from, indicting Assange. ………</p> <p>WikiLeaks Didn’t Endanger Informants and Saved Lives</p> <p>Although the U.S. government claims that Assange endangered informants named in the published documents, John Goetz, an investigative reporter who worked for Germany’s Der Spiegel, testified that Assange took pains to ensure that the names of U.S. informants in Iraq and Afghanistan were redacted to protect their identities. ……..</p> <p>Moreover, WikiLeaks’s revelations actually saved lives. After WikiLeaks published evidence of Iraqi torture centers the U.S. had established, the Iraqi government refused Obama’s request to extend immunity to U.S. soldiers who commit criminal and civil offenses there. As a result, Obama had to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq.</p> <p>WikiLeaks also revealed evidence of wrongdoing by other countries besides the United States. The organization uncovered Russian surveillance, published exposés of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and some say WikiLeaks’s exposure of corruption in Tunisia and torture in Egypt helped catalyze the Arab Spring…………</p> <p>Assange’s Prosecution Will Chill Journalism</p> <p>Ostensibly to get around allegations that it is prosecuting Assange for conducting journalism, the Trump administration is trying to paint him as a hacker by accusing him of conspiring with Manning to break into a government computer to steal government documents, in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. But, as Patrick Eller, a digital forensic expert, testified, the attempted cracking of the password hash was not technologically possible in 2010, when the conversation between Assange and Manning occurred. Even if it were feasible, the purpose would not have been to conceal Manning’s identity and it would not have given Manning any increased access to government databases.</p> <p>The prosecution of Assange would set a disturbing example for journalists and media outlets that publish information critical of the government. Team Trump singled out Assange to deter journalists from publishing material that criticizes U.S. policy. If Assange is extradited to the United States and convicted of the charges against him, it would chill journalists from reporting the facts for fear they could be indicted under the Espionage Act……….</p> <p>When she set the November 16 date for the defense to submit closing arguments, Judge Vanessa Baraitser asked the defense how the U.S. presidential election would affect its case and declared that her decision on extradition would come after that election, stating, “That’s one of the factors going into my decision.” Kristinn Hrafnsson, editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said that the judge “acknowledged what has been clear since even before the first indictment against Julian Assange was unsealed — that this is a politically motivated prosecution.”</p> <p>Baraitser, who has granted extradition in 96 percent of the cases that have come before her, plans to issue her ruling on January 4. If she grants extradition, there will be several levels of appeals, including to the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>The stakes could not be higher. https://truthout.org/articles/assange-faces-extradition-for-exposing-us-war-crimes/?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=614ce999-9844-4d61-a600-169db0c99052</p>",4

Republic that amounted to $3.36 million or P168 million in the account of Arelma, Inc., the company used by the late dictator to hide his ill-gotten wealth.</p> <p>Last week, the Sandiganbayan Second Division ordered Royal Traders Holding Co. Inc to pay the Philippine government almost P1.6 billion, the amount representing the bank certificates issued by Royal Traders to the Marcos family. The bank certificates were among the family’s loot taken to Hawaii when they left after the people power revolt.</p> <p>1Sambayan averred that Marcos’ attempt to revise the historical accounts “through the use of paid internet trolls and the exploitation of the flaws of social media” is “yet another heinous crime.”</p> <p>“We call on the youth of today, or those who were either too young to remember or weren’t even born yet, to resist this attempt to rewrite the pages of our storied past, especially the one where we fought hard to regain our democracy,” the group said.</p> <p>“Do not be deceived by paid internet trolls who peddle lies after lies, so that what happened during the Marcos era will not repeat itself at your time,” it added.</p> <p>READ: Sandiganbayan orders Royal Traders Holding to pay gov’t P365-M in Marcoses’ bank deposits</p> <p>While plundering the nation’s coffers is an atrocity to the people, 1Sambayan said that it was “just the tip of the iceberg.”</p> <p>“The rest of the atrocities of Marcos during the dark days of Martial Law have been documented and recorded. #NeverForget those who perished during this period, and don’t allow the trolls to erase the memories, painful as they are, of the people’s struggle under Marcos’s rule,” the coalition said.</p> <p>Amnesty International said that the Martial Law years tortured more than 34,000 people and illegally arrested more than 70,000 people while the military and police and killed 3,240. More than 107,000 people were primary victims of human rights violations during the 21-year regime.</p> <p>1Sambayan also appealed to the Department of Education “to form a committee that will study and craft guidelines for the inclusion of the Marcos era in our children’s prescribed history books, to be studied by generations after generations, so no trolls posting on Facebook or YouTube can influence the #Truth.”</p>",4

964167304,World Report 2021: Israel and Palestine,2020-12-15 09:58:35-05:00,"<p>Israeli authorities in 2020 systematically repressed and discriminated against Palestinians in ways that far exceeded the security justifications they often provided.</p> <p>For a 13th consecutive year, the government enforced a generalized travel ban on Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip and sharply restricted the entry and exit of goods. These restrictions, not based on an individualized assessment of security risk, robbed with rare exceptions the 2 million Palestinians living there of their right to freedom of movement, limited their access to electricity and water, and devastated the economy. Eighty percent of Gaza’s residents depend on humanitarian aid.</p> <p>Israeli authorities also facilitated the further transfer of Israeli citizens into settlements in the occupied West Bank, a war crime. The Israeli group Peace Now said that Israeli officials in 2020 advanced plans for more housing units in West Bank settlements, 12,159 as of October 15, more than in any other year since it began tracking these statistics in 2012.</p> <p>According to the UN Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of October 19, 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 568 Palestinian homes and other structures in the West Bank this year, including in East Jerusalem, displacing 759 people. Most buildings were demolished for lacking Israeli building permits, which are virtually impossible to obtain. As the Covid-19 pandemic spread between March and August, Israel averaged its highest home demolition rate in four years, OCHA found. On November 3, Israeli authorities razed the homes of most residents of the Palestinian community of Khirbet Humsah in the Jordan Valley for being in an area it designated as a “firing zone,” displacing 73 people, 41 of them children.</p> <p>The coalition agreement between the Likud and Blue and White parties that led to the formation of an Israeli government in May, after three rounds of elections in the preceding year, established a process to bring annexation of additional parts of the West Bank for approval. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in August that Israel would delay the move following an agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, but that “there is no change to my plan to extend sovereignty” over the West Bank.</p> <p>Both the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Hamas authorities in Gaza detained opponents and critics for their peaceful expression and tortured some in their custody. The Palestinian statutory watchdog, Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), received 269 complaints of arbitrary arrests, 147 against the PA and 122 by Hamas; 90 complaints of torture and ill-treatment, 40 against the PA and 50 against Hamas, and 62 complaints against the PA of detention without trial or charge pursuant to orders from a regional governor between January and September 2020. The number of complaints decreased compared to previous years, which the ICHR attributes primarily to the fewer prison visits it conducted amid the pandemic.</p> <p>Gaza Strip</p> <p>Although fighting between Israel and Palestinian armed groups decreased compared to previous years, Israeli authorities maintained their closure of Gaza, alongside restrictions Egypt maintains on its border. Palestinian armed groups, as of October 21, fired 187 unguided rockets or mortar shells towards Israeli population centers in 2020, according to the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, inherently indiscriminate attacks that amount to war crimes.</p> <p>Incendiary balloons launched into Israel by Palestinians in Gaza prompted Israeli authorities in August in retaliation to limit the entry into Gaza of goods, including food and medicine, to block access to Gaza’s territorial waters for Palestinian fishermen and to slash fuel imports to Gaza’s power plant, further reducing the already limited supply of electricity for almost three weeks. These measures, targeting Gaza’s general civilian population, amount to unlawful collective punishment.</p> <p>In August, Gaza recorded its first cases of community transmission of coronavirus. Hamas authorities, which since March had required returning residents to spend 21 days in quarantine at centers they oversee, imposed a 14-day lockdown and other restrictive measures. As of October 19, Gaza’s Health Ministry had recorded 4,722 Covid-19 cases and 28 deaths, most of them since August.</p> <p>Israeli Closure</p> <p>Israel restricted the ability of most Gaza residents to travel through the Erez Crossing, the sole passenger crossing from Gaza into Israel through which Palestinians travel to the West Bank and abroad. A generalized travel ban applies to all Palestinians except those whom Israeli authorities deem as presenting “exceptional humanitarian circumstances,” mostly those needing vital medical treatment and their companions, as well as prominent business people.</p> <p>During January and February, an average of 778 Palestinians in Gaza exited via Erez each day, a fraction of the daily average of more than 24,000 before the beginning of the second Intifada in September 2000, according to the Israeli rights group, Gisha. After Israel tightened the closure amid the pandemic, that figure plummeted between April and September to about nine people per day.</p> <p>In May, the PA suspended security and administrative coordination with Israel, including the issuance of travel permits, in response to Israel’s annexation plans. This move left Gaza residents with no clear way to apply for permits, since Israeli authorities do not have a formal physical presence inside Gaza and did not create alternative mechanisms to accept applications directly. Several organizations in June began applying on behalf of Palestinians with scheduled appointments for urgent medical care outside Gaza and the World Health Organization (WHO) took on the coordination role in September. According to data received by the WHO, Israel denied or failed to respond in a timely manner to 54 percent of such applications in June. In November, the PA said that it would resume security and administrative coordination with Israel.</p> <p>Gaza’s exports between January and September, mostly destined for the West Bank and Israel, averaged 256 truckloads per month, compared to the monthly average of 1,064 truckloads prior to the June 2007 tightening of the closure, according to Gisha. Israel also sharply restricted and often prohibited the entry of what they deem “dual-use” materials, items that could be used for military purposes. The list included X-ray and communications equipment, construction materials, spare parts and batteries for assistive devices used by people with disabilities, and other vital civilian items.</p> <p>Families in Gaza on average received slightly more than 12 hours of electricity a day during the first nine months of 2020, according to OCHA. Chronic prolonged power outages encumber everyday life, in particular for people with disabilities who rely on light to communicate using sign language or equipment powered by electricity, such as elevators or electric wheelchairs, to move. More than 96 percent of groundwater in Gaza is “unfit for human consumption,” OCHA found. According to the WHO, 47 percent of what it deems to be “essential” medicines were at zero stock level (less than one month's supply) at Gaza’s Central Drug Store at the end of September.</p> <p>Egypt also sharply restricted the movement of people and goods at its Rafah crossing with Gaza, including restricting entry to those who do not have a Palestinian ID because Israel did not include them in the population registry they control. In the first nine months of 2020, an average of 4,767 Palestinians crossed monthly in both directions, less than the monthly average of 12,172 in 2019 and over 40,000 before the 2013 military coup in Egypt, according to Gisha.</p> <p>Hamas and Palestinian Armed Groups in Gaza</p> <p>Hamas authorities provided no information about two Israeli civilians with psychosocial disabilities, Avera Mangistu and Hisham al-Sayed, whom they have apparently held in violation of international law for more than five years after they entered Gaza.</p> <p>In April, Hamas authorities detained seven activists for participating in a video chat where they answered questions from Israeli civilians about life in Gaza. Two were detained for more than six months and three were convicted under military law of “weakening the revolutionary spirit.”</p> <p>Hamas authorities carried out no executions in 2020; they had carried out 25, following trials marred with due process violations, since they took control in Gaza in June 2007. Courts in Gaza had, as of November 2, sentenced 145 people to death in that time, according to the Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights.</p> <p>A British Mandate-era law still in force in Gaza punishes “unnatural intercourse” of a sexual nature, understood to include same-sex relationships, with up to 10 years in prison, although Human Rights Watch has not documented detentions for same-sex conduct.</p> <p>West Bank</p> <p>Israeli Use of Force & Detentions</p> <p>In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Israeli security forces killed 20 Palestinians and wounded at least 2,001 as of October 5, according to OCHA, including those alleged to have attacked Israelis, but also those uninvolved in violence.</p> <p>On May 30, Israeli border police in Jerusalem’s Old City fatally shot an unarmed 32-year-old Palestinian man with autism, Eyad al-Hallaq, after he reportedly fled when they asked him to stop. According to what an officer on the scene reportedly told Israeli investigators, police shot him in a “closed space” where he did not “endanger” anyone. In October, authorities indicated that they will likely charge the officer who shot al-Hallaq with reckless homicide, pending a pretrial hearing.</p> <p>On June 23, border police shot and killed, apparently unlawfully, 26-year-old Ahmed Erekat after his car crashed into a checkpoint and he exited the vehicle in circumstances where he did not appear to pose an imminent threat to life. Authorities characterized the incident as a car-ramming attack; his family said it was an accident.</p> <p>Israeli authorities have rarely held accountable security forces who used excessive force or settlers who attacked Palestinians.</p> <p>Settler violence against Palestinians during the first five months of 2020 remained at 2019 levels, a marked increase from prior years, OCHA found. Settlers killed one Palestinian civilian, wounded 103, and caused property damage in 136 incidents as of October 5, according to OCHA.</p> <p>Palestinian attackers killed one Israeli soldier and wounded at least 28 Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, as of September 22.</p> <p>Israeli authorities in September said they would continue withholding the bodies of Palestinians killed in what they consider security incidents primarily as leverage to secure Hamas’s release of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers presumed killed in 2014 hostilities. Israel held, as of September, the bodies of 67 Palestinians killed since 2015, according to the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center.</p> <p>In the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya, Israeli forces arrested 850 Palestinians between April 2019 and April 2020, according to the Israeli rights group, B’Tselem, as part of an “ongoing campaign of abuse” against its residents.</p> <p>In April, Israeli police shut down a coronavirus testing center set up by residents in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan on the grounds that it operated with PA assistance.</p> <p>Israeli authorities closely monitor online speech by Palestinians, in part relying on predictive algorithms to determine whom to target, and have detained Palestinians based on social media posts and other expressive activity.</p> <p>As of August 31, according to Israeli Prison Services figures, Israel held 4,207 Palestinians in custody for “security” offenses, including 153 children, many for throwing stones, and 355 in administrative detention without formal charges or trial and based on secret evidence.</p> <p>While applying Israeli civil law to settlers, Israeli authorities govern West Bank Palestinians, excluding Jerusalem residents, under harsh military law. In so doing, they deny them basic due process and try them in military courts with a near-100 percent conviction rate. Israel incarcerates many Palestinians from the OPT inside Israel, complicating family visits and violating international humanitarian law’s prohibition against their transfer outside occupied territory.</p> <p>Settlements & Home Demolitions</p> <p>Israel allocated additional confiscated Palestinian land to unlawful settlements and provided security, infrastructure, and services for more than 647,000 settlers residing in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.</p> <p>In June, Israel’s Supreme Court struck down a law allowing authorities to retroactively expropriate land on which settlements had been built but that Israel acknowledged to be privately owned by Palestinians. In its justification, however, the court cited “less harmful tools” that could have the same effect, including a military order that upholds land deals when authorities reasonably believed at the time of sale that the land was not privately owned, effectively approving the unlawful expropriations.</p> <p>Jerusalem courts in several cases ordered the eviction of Palestinian families from homes in which they had lived for decades in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan largely based on discriminatory laws that favor claims that the land belonged to Jewish owners before 1948 or that allow the state to take over land as “absentee property.”</p> <p>The difficulty in obtaining Israeli building permits in East Jerusalem and the 60 percent of the West Bank under Israel’s exclusive control (Area C) has driven Palestinians to construct housing, schools, and business structures that are at constant risk of demolition or confiscation for being unauthorized. OCHA considered, as of April 2020, 46 Palestinian West Bank communities to be at “high risk of forcible transfer” due to coercive Israeli policies. International law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property unless “absolutely necessary” for “military operations.”</p> <p>Freedom of Movement for Palestinians</p> <p>Israel continued to enforce its permit regime requiring Palestinian ID holders with rare exceptions to apply for time-limited permits from the Israeli army to enter large parts of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. B’Tselem describes this as “an arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bureaucratic system” where “many applications are denied without explanation, with no real avenue for appeal.” Israeli authorities, as of June, maintained nearly 600 checkpoints and other permanent obstacles within the West Bank, in addition to nearly 1,500 ad-hoc “flying” checkpoints erected between April 2019 and March 2020, according to OCHA. Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation.</p> <p>The separation barrier, which Israel said it built for security reasons but 85 percent of which falls within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line separating Israeli from Palestinian territory, cuts off thousands of Palestinians from their agricultural lands. It also isolates 11,000 Palestinians who live on the western side of the barrier but are not allowed to travel to Israel and whose ability to cross the barrier to access their property and basic services is highly restricted.</p> <p>The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank</p> <p>As of October 21, the PA reported 43,308 Covid-19 cases and 399 deaths since the outbreak began in the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem. While at times imposing restrictions across the parts of the West Bank where it manages affairs, it has largely relied on localized lockdowns of areas that experience a surge in cases.</p> <p>Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh pledged in July 2019 to end arbitrary arrests. In June, PA forces detained journalist Sami al-Sai for three weeks over suspicions that he administered a Facebook page that had posted information about PA corruption. PA forces in July arrested about 20 activists in Ramallah heading to a protest about PA corruption, detaining them for more than a week, and prosecuting them on charges of gathering illegally and violating restrictive Covid-19 measures.</p> <p>PA personal status laws discriminated against women, including in relation to marriage, divorce, and decisions relating to custody of children and inheritance. Women’s rights groups documented an increase in reports of domestic violence during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. However, Palestine has no comprehensive domestic violence law. The PA is considering a draft family protection law, but women’s rights groups have raised concern that it does not go far enough to prevent abuse and protect survivors.</p> <p>Israel</p> <p>Israel had registered 306,649 Covid-19 cases and 2,278 deaths, including in East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements, as of October 21. Israel instituted lockdowns between late March and early May, and again between late September and mid-October. To track Covid-19, Israeli authorities authorized Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, to collect from telecommunications providers, beginning in March, vast amounts of location-tracking data from the cellphones of ordinary Israelis without their consent. The Knesset in July authorized the surveillance for six months, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in April that the government must bring the program under legislation.</p> <p>In June, the Knesset renewed a temporary order in place since 2003 that bars, with few exceptions, granting long-term legal status or residency inside Israel to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents, in many cases forcing the separation of families.</p> <p>Thousands of Israelis participated in weekly demonstrations beginning in June, primarily against the government’s handling of Covid-19 and corruption charges against Prime Minister Netanyahu. Israeli police forcibly dispersed several demonstrations and beat and arrested scores of protesters. The Israeli group Human Rights Defenders Fund said that between July 14 and 26 in Jerusalem alone it provided legal counsel to more than 150 demonstrators who had been detained.</p> <p>Israeli authorities continued to systematically deny asylum claims of the roughly 32,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers in the country. To pressure them to leave, the government tries to make their lives “miserable,” in the words of Israel’s interior minister in 2012, through restrictions on movement, work permits, and access to health care. The Supreme Court in April struck down a law that permitted confiscation of a portion of their salaries.</p> <p>Key International Actors</p> <p>The United States in January presented a plan that purports to offer a two-state solution but envisions permanent Israeli domination over large swaths of the West Bank and formal annexation of settlements, the Jordan Valley, and other parts of Area C, while setting conditions that would make the realization of a Palestinian state nearly impossible. In June, members of the US Congress raised concerns about annexation in letters to Prime Minister Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.</p> <p>In response to the US plan, 27 European Union member states, including Germany and France, called for ensuring equal rights for Palestinians and Israelis. Over the year, the EU repeatedly urged Israel to abandon annexation plans and halt settlement construction, highlighting their illegality under international humanitarian law; however, strong divisions among EU member states have so far frustrated attempts to adopt punitive EU measures in response to Israel’s persistent and serious violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>In February, the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released the long-awaited database of businesses that have enabled or profited from settlements, listing 112 businesses.</p> <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor’s office concluded its preliminary examination of the Palestine situation in December 2019 and determined that all the necessary criteria to proceed with a formal investigation of alleged serious crimes by Israelis and Palestinians had been met. However, it requested guidance from the court’s judges on the ICC’s territorial jurisdiction before commencing a probe. At time of writing, a decision was pending.</p>",4
999275290,Burundi - Release Lawyer Tony Germain Nkina,2021-08-11 05:28:48,"<p>press release</p> <p>Nairobi — Ex-Member of Civil Society Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison</p> <p>Burundian authorities should immediately and unconditionally release lawyer, Tony Germain Nkina, who was sentenced to five years in prison in June 2021 in all likelihood because of his past human rights work, six international human rights groups said today.</p> <p>The groups - Amnesty International, the Burundi Human Rights Initiative, DefendDefenders (East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project), Human Rights Watch, Protection International and TRIAL International - believe that the likely reason for Nkina's arrest was his former affiliation with the Association for the Protection of Human Rights and Detained Persons (Association pour la protection des droits humains et des personnes détenues, APRODH), which was one of the leading human rights groups in Burundi until 2015.</p> <p>The prosecution and imprisonment of Tony Germain Nkina is a worrying reminder that those who used to be part of Burundi's once vibrant human rights movement are still at risk. The Burundian authorities should demonstrate their commitment to protecting human rights by immediately releasing Nkina and dropping all the charges against him. Burundi's international partners should support the calls for his release.</p> <p>Nkina, a lawyer in Kayanza province in northern Burundi, was arrested on October 13, 2020, in Kabarore commune, where he was visiting a client for his professional work. He was briefly detained by the intelligence service in Kayanza, then transferred to police detention, and finally to Ngozi prison, where he is currently detained.</p> <p>October 2020 was a tense period in Kayanza following attacks by an armed group in the previous weeks, with several people killed or abducted. Nkina happened to visit Kabarore, one of the areas affected, soon after these attacks. The authorities accused him of collaborating with the armed opposition group RED-Tabara (Resistance for the Rule of Law in Burundi), which they hold responsible for the attacks, and charged him with endangering internal state security.</p> <p>On June 15, 2021, the court of Kayanza convicted Nkina of ""collaboration with rebels who attacked Burundi,"" and sentenced him to five years in prison and a fine of one million Burundian francs (approximately US$ 500). His client, Apollinaire Hitimana, whom he had been advising on a land dispute and was arrested with him, was found guilty of complicity in the same offence and sentenced to two and a half years and a fine of 500,000 Burundian francs. An appeal hearing is scheduled for August 12, at the Ngozi court of appeal.</p> <p>Nkina was APRODH's representative in Kayanza until the government suspended the organization in 2015 as part of a larger crackdown on civil society over opposition to President Pierre Nkurunziza running for a controversial third term. He has not worked for APRODH or any other Burundian civil society organization for the past six years. He is a well-known lawyer in Kayanza and a member of the Gitega bar. However, authorities in Kayanza may still associate him with APRODH, especially as he was riding his former APRODH motorcycle on the day of his arrest.</p> <p>The prosecution accused him, among other things, of travelling to Rwanda to give information to APRODH's president, Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, who lives in Europe, as well as to RED-Tabara. The prosecution has not presented any evidence to substantiate these allegations.</p> <p>Nkina is the only known former staff member of a human rights organization imprisoned in Burundi at the present time. Two other human rights defenders were released earlier in 2021.</p> <p>For further details about the government repression of human rights activists, please see below.</p> <p>Background</p> <p>APRODH was one of Burundi's most active and best-known human rights organizations. Mbonimpa narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 2015 with life-threatening injuries. Mbonimpa's son and his son-in-law were both shot dead in 2015.</p> <p>APRODH's representative in Gitega province, Nestor Nibitanga, was arrested in 2017 and sentenced in 2018 to five years in prison on charges similar to those brought against Nkina. He was released in April as part of President Évariste Ndayishimiye's pardon of more than 5,000 prisoners.</p> <p>Another human rights defender, Germain Rukuki, was arrested in 2017 and sentenced to 32 years in prison in 2018 on trumped-up charges related to his human rights work. His sentence was confirmed by the appeal court in 2019, but the appeal court's decision was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court. The appeal court reduced his sentence to one year in June 2021. He was released the same month.</p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Human Rights Legal Affairs NGO By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

The government suspended or closed most independent human rights organizations and media outlets and drove them into exile. Despite some overtures by President Ndayishimiye towards the media in 2021, the Burundian government continues to view human rights work with suspicion, and severe restrictions on human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, remain in place.</p> <p>Most independent human rights organizations have been unable to resume their activities in Burundi, especially as the Burundian authorities have issued arrest warrants for many of their leading activists in exile. Twelve human rights defenders and journalists were among a group of 34 people sentenced to life in prison in absentia in June 2020 on accusations of involvement in an attempted coup in May 2015; the Supreme Court judgment was not made public until February 2021.</p>",4
1017718246,Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi sentenced to jail,2021-12-06 00:00:00,"<p>Monday’s conviction is first in a dozen cases Myanmar’s military has brought against deposed leader since February coup.</p> <p>A court in military-ruled Myanmar has found elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was removed by the generals when they seized power, guilty of charges widely dismissed as politically motivated and sentenced her to detention at an undisclosed location.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi, who was convicted in a ruling on Monday, was initially given a four year term. The sentence was reduced after a partial pardon from coup leader and army chief Min Aung Hlaing, state TV reported.</p> <p>President Win Myint was also sentenced to four years as the court delivered its first verdicts in numerous cases against Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian leaders deposed by the military in a coup on February 1. Win Myint’s sentence was also later cut to two years.</p> <p>According to the report on MRTV, the sentences would be applied “at their current detention places,” apparently meaning they would not be sent to prison. It is not clear where Aung San Suu Kyi has been held.</p> <p>Zaw Min Tun, a spokesman for Myanmar’s military told the AFP news agency on Monday that Aung San Suu Kyi was found guilty of incitement and of violating COVID-19 rules.</p> <p>The ruling on Monday is the first in a dozen cases the military has brought against the 76-year-old since it seized power from her civilian government hours before a new parliament was due to convene. The trial in Naypyidaw has been closed to the media, while the military has barred Aung San Suu Kyi’s lawyers from communicating with the media and the public.</p> <p>‘Outrageous action’</p> <p>Other cases against the Nobel Peace Prize laureate include multiple charges of corruption, violations of a state secrets act, and a telecoms law that together carry a maximum sentence of more than 100 years in prison.</p> <p>Her supporters have said the cases are baseless and designed to end her political career and tie her up in legal proceedings while the military consolidates power.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi has denied all the charges.</p> <p>The UN human rights investigator on Myanmar urged countries on Monday to increase economic pressure on Myanmar’s generals after the sentences were announced.</p> <p>“Today’s sentencing demonstrates why the international community must take stronger action to support the people of Myanmar by denying the junta the revenue and weapons that they need to continue their illegitimate grip on the people of Myanmar,” Thomas Andrews, a former US congressman who is serving in the independent post, said in a statement.</p> <p>“I call upon Member States to significantly increase pressure on the junta as a result of this outrageous action.”</p> <p>‘Potent force’</p> <p>The daughter of the hero of Myanmar’s independence from British colonial rule, Aung San Suu Kyi spent years under house arrest under a previous military regime.</p> <p>She was freed in 2010 and led her National League for Democracy (NLD) to a landslide victory in a 2015 election.</p> <p>Her party won another landslide in November last year but, seeking to justify its coup, the military has claimed the vote was rigged. The election commission has said there was no evidence of fraud.</p> <p>Historian and author Thant Myint-U said the military leaders thought their predecessors who launched reforms more than 20 years ago had gone too far in allowing Aung San Suu Kyi back into politics and the entire reason for the coup was to exclude her.</p> <p>“She remains far and away most popular in Myanmar politics and may still be a potent force in what’s to come,” he told the Reuters news agency.</p> <p>Western states have demanded Aung San Suu Kyi’s release and condemned the violence since the coup.</p> <p>On Monday, the United Kingdom said the elected leader’s sentencing was “another appalling attempt by Myanmar’s military regime to stifle opposition and suppress freedom and democracy” and called on the “regime to release political prisoners, engage in dialogue and allow a return to democracy”.</p> <p>Matthew Smith, the chief executive of the Fortify Rights group, said the sentencing was “part of a widespread and systematic attack on the civilian population” and called for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.</p> <p>ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), a group of Southeast Asian MPs, also condemned Monday’s sentence as a “travesty of justice”.</p> <p>“Since the day of the coup, it’s been clear that the charges against Aung San Suu Kyi, and the dozens of other detained MPs, have been nothing more than an excuse by the junta to justify their illegal power grab,” said Charles Santiago, a Malaysian legislator who heads the APHR.</p> <p>The regional Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar, must “hold the line against this illegal takeover”, he said, adding that Monday’s ruling demonstrates “the junta’s continuing contempt for ASEAN” and its peace plan, which was agreed with Myanmar’s military in April and which includes initiating dialogue between the opposing sides in the country.</p> <p>‘Farcical and corrupt’</p> <p>Since the coup, Myanmar has been in turmoil, paralysed by protests and instability as the military uses force to crack down on coup opponents. Security forces have killed at least 1,303 people in the clampdown, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a human rights group that tracks killings and abuses by the country’s security forces.</p> <p>At least 354 opponents of the coup have also been sentenced to jail or to death, according to AAPP, including Aung San Suu Kyi’s aide, Win Htein, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail in October.</p> <p>Amnesty International’s Ming Yu Hah said the sentencing of Aung San Suu Kyi on “bogus charges are the latest example of the military’s determination to eliminate all opposition and suffocate freedoms in Myanmar”.</p> <p>“The court’s farcical and corrupt decision is part of a devastating pattern of arbitrary punishment that has seen more than 1,300 people killed and thousands arrested since the military coup in February,” she said, calling for swift, decisive and unified action from the international community.</p> <p>“The international community must step up to protect civilians and hold perpetrators of grave violations to account, and ensure humanitarian and health assistance is granted as a matter of utmost urgency,” she said.</p>",4

I wouldn’t hold my breath — Lisa Nandy (@lisanandy) May 27, 2021</p> <p>But Mr Kwarteng said it was “absolutely right” for Mr Johnson to “be building bilateral relations” after Brexit.</p> <p>Addressing Mr Orban’s remarks on migrants being “a poison”, Mr Kwarteng told Sky News: “I think Viktor Orban’s views on migrants are things that I would not endorse in any way.</p> <p>“Having said that, I think that we have to engage with the EU, he’s an EU leader.</p> <p>“Hungary is an EU country, we were part of the EU. And in this post-Brexit world, I think it’s absolutely right for us to be building bilateral relations with countries in the former EU.</p> <p>“I think it’s completely reasonable to do that, and not to do so I think would be irresponsible.</p> <p>“So it’s a diplomatic relationship that we want to develop.”</p> <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey had written to Mr Johnson to outline 10 challenges the Prime Minister should have put to Mr Orban during their discussions.</p> <p>Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban speaks to the media in Downing Street after his meeting with Boris Johnson (Stefan Rousseau/PA)</p> <p>Sir Ed called on the Conservative Party leader to question the Hungarian prime minister on his links with Russia, his attempts to silence critical media outlets and for failing to hold “free” elections.</p> <p>He said: “We are extremely concerned that you have chosen to invite Prime Minister Orban to Downing Street.</p> <p>“Orban’s rule has been marked by a sustained assault on Hungarian democracy, on press freedom and on human rights.”</p> <p>Labour shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, also called for the Prime Minister to “challenge the repeated attempts to undermine democratic values”.</p> <p>No 10 on Thursday condemned as “divisive and wrong” comments made by Mr Orban ahead of his visit.</p> <p>Mr Johnson has vowed not to shy away from bringing up issues surrounding human rights but Downing Street argued the meeting was “vital” to Britain’s interests.</p> <p>“As president of the Visegrad group of Central European nations later this year, co-operation with Hungary is vital to the UK’s prosperity and security,” said the Prime Minister’s spokesman.</p> <p>Supporters of Stand Up To Racism were due to protest outside Downing Street, with spokesman Weyman Bennett arguing Mr Orban has been a “prominent spokesperson for the far right from a position of power as a prime minister of Hungary”.</p>",4
1039092577,Washington Post columnist arrested in Moscow after criticizing Putin,2022-04-12 00:00:00,"<p>Russian authorities on Monday arrested Vladimir Kara-Murza — a prominent Kremlin critic and politician who has written columns for The Washington Post protesting Russia’s war in Ukraine and violations of human rights.</p> <p>Kara-Murza was arrested outside his home in Moscow, the same day CNN aired an interview in which he called Vladimir Putin’s government “a regime of murderers” and predicted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would lead to Putin’s downfall.</p> <p>The 40-year-old Putin critic previously survived two poisonings, in 2015 and 2017, which he said were orchestrated by the Kremlin in retaliation for his advocacy of western sanctions against the Russian government.</p> <p>Russia has denied that it was the source of the poisonings, which left Kara-Murza in a coma both times. But investigations by independent organizations found that he had been followed by members of the same federal agency that allegedly poisoned jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and at least three other opposition figures.</p> <p>His wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, confirmed his arrest in a tweet late Monday. “Twice have the Russian authorities tried to kill my husband for advocating for sanctions against thieves and murderers, and now they want to throw him in prison for calling their bloody war a WAR,” she wrote. “I demand my husband’s immediate release.”</p> <p>“Following poisonings and other grave threats, this outrageous detention is the latest move in Vladimir Putin’s ongoing effort to silence Kara-Murza and hide the truth about the atrocities Putin is committing in the Russian people’s name,” The Post’s publisher, Fred Ryan, said in a statement praising the writer’s courage. “No one should be deceived by the Russian government’s trumped-up charges and smears, and Kara-Murza should be released immediately.”</p> <p>Kara-Murza is a longtime colleague of the late Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was assassinated outside the Kremlin in 2015. He is an author, documentary director and former candidate for the Russian parliament, and served as deputy leader of a political organization, the People’s Freedom Party.</p> <p>He played a key role in getting the United States, European Union, Canada and Britain to adopt sanctions laws in 2012, known as the Magnitsky Act, that target individuals in Russia and elsewhere who are complicit in human-rights violations.</p> <p>Kara-Murza has written dozens of columns for The Post’s Global Opinions section over the past few years that have been critical of the Russian government.</p> <p>“Within a single week, all - literally, all - of Russia’s remaining independent media voices have been silenced in a coordinated effort by the prosecutor general’s office and the government’s main censorship agency,” he wrote in a column March 7. “One after another, media outlets that dared to report honestly on Putin’s assault on Ukraine had their signals cut off and their websites blocked.”</p> <p>His arrest follows the Kremlin’s sharp crackdown on independent news media and dissent in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. The Russian parliament last month enacted a law making it a crime punishable by prison terms of up to 15 years for spreading what it considers “fake” news about the military, including calling the invasion of Ukraine an “invasion.”</p> <p>As other dissident figures have fled the country, Kara-Murza has been one of the few to remain in Russia.</p> <p>In an interview that aired Monday on CNN+, the network’s new streaming service, Kara-Murza said, “I have absolutely no doubt that the Putin regime will end over this war in Ukraine.”</p> <p>He called Putin’s government “a regime of murderers. It is important to say it out loud. It is really tragic frankly, I have no other word for this, that it took a large-scale war in the middle of Europe, which Vladimir Putin is now conducting against Ukraine, for most western leaders to finally open their eyes to the true nature of this regime.”</p> <p>He added defiantly, “The biggest gift ... we could give to the Kremlin would be to those of us who are in opposition to Putin’s regime we could give up and run. That’s all they want from us.”</p> <p>The Russian human-rights group OVD-Info said Kara-Murza was taken by arresting officers to a police station in central Moscow, where he was being held on a 15-day administrative jail sentence on charges of disobeying police orders. The organization cited his lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov.</p> <p>Kara-Murza is the third writer associated with The Post to face arrest and persecution at the hands of a foreign government in recent years.</p> <p>Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian writer and dissident, also was a contributor to Global Opinions when he was murdered in October 2018 by Saudi agents in that nation’s consulate in Istanbul. The CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s assassination, a conclusion later confirmed by the United Nation’s High Commissioner for Human Rights after a six-month investigation.</p> <p>Jason Rezaian, The Post’s correspondent in Tehran from 2012 to 2016, spent 544 days in prison in Iran without trial before his release in early 2016. Rezaian is now a writer for Global Opinions.</p> <p>CNN, which broadcast the interview with Kara-Murza, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>",4

Photo by Hein Htet/EPA</p> <p>The Myanmar military on Monday took control of the government and announced a nationwide state of emergency hours after detaining the country’s civilian leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other high-ranking elected government officials in a coup.</p> <p>Military-backed Vice President U Myint Swe, a former general, has been appointed acting president, the military announced in a broadcast on its Myawaddy News television channel.</p> <p>The military, known as the Tatmadaw, said it called a yearlong state of emergency over alleged irregularities with November’s parliamentary elections, during which Suu Kyi’s National League of Democracy Party won a landslide with 399 of the 462 seats in parliament.</p> <p>The November general elections were the second since Myanmar began its transition away from a military dictatorship toward a democracy. In 2015, the NLD won 390 seats, forming the country’s first civilian government in more than 50 years and installing Suu Kyi, a democracy icon who spent more than 15 years under house detention, in the de facto leadership role of state councillor.</p> <p>The Tatmadaw claimed fraud after the election, but Myanmar’s election commission dismissed the charges, saying the accusations were baseless.</p> <p>Myo Nyunt, the spokesman for the ruling National League of Democracy Party, confirmed to local news outlet The Irrawaddy that Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint and other party members, lawmakers and Cabinet officials across the country had been detained in the early morning roundup.</p> <p>“This is a military coup attempt, but they can claim it is not, by forcing the president to call an urgent national security security meeting for an official handover of power to them,” the NLD spokesman told The Irrawaddy.</p> <p>In a statement published to her official NLD chair Facebook account, Suu Kyi has called for citizens to reject the military takeover.</p> <p>The Tatmadaw’s actions are “trying to bring the country back under military dictatorship,” the statement said. “Therefore, I urge the people to respond with a strong opposition to the military coup.”</p> <p>Access to television stations, phone lines and Internet services have been cut, The Myanmar Times reported.</p> <p>nternet monitoring site NetBlocks reported widespread disruptions in Myanmar on Monday morning, with connectivity falling by as much as 75%.</p> <p>“The doors just opened to a very different future,” historian and writer Thant Myint-U tweeted. “I have a sinking feeling that no one will really be able to control what comes next. And remember Myanmar’s a country awash in weapons, with deep divisions across ethnic & religious lines, where millions can barely feed themselves.”</p> <p>At least 24 people have been arrested so far, according to Manny Maung of Human Rights Watch, including democracy activists, writers and filmmakers in addition to government officials.</p> <p>“Whether or not the Myanmar military’s actions are consistent with the ’08 Constitution, [Human Rights Watch] and [Human Rights Watch Burma] believes they are violating fundamental human rights by arbitrarily arresting political leaders and activists,” she said. “Given the military’s horrific human rights record, we are deeply concerned for the safety of those detained and of further serious violations that could happen.”</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned the military late Sunday to adhere to democratic norms and the rule of law and threatened repercussions.</p> <p>“The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar’s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed,” she said in a statement. “We are monitoring the situation closely and stand with the people of Burma, who have already endured so much in their quest for democracy and peace.”</p> <p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on the military leaders to release all government officials, including Suu Kyi, and said the United States expressed “grave concern and alarm” over reports of the coup.</p> <p>“We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government and civilian government leaders, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders,” the United States’ top diplomat said in a statement. “The United States stands with the people of [Myanmar] in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace and development.”</p> <p>“The military must reverse these actions immediately,” he said.</p> <p>UPI</p>",4

1010099280,"Myanmar Junta Snubbed by ASEAN, Political Prisoners Freed",2021-10-19 00:00:00,"<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) announced over the weekend that General Min Aung Hlaing, leader of the military junta in Myanmar, will not be invited to the association’s October 26-28 summit. The unprecedented snub of Gen. Hlaing was welcomed by the Burmese opposition, which asked ASEAN to go even further and invite a representative from the civilian shadow government.</p> <p>Myanmar’s elected civilian government was deposed in a February coup. The military claimed it was necessary to seize power because the previous election was held improperly during the coronavirus pandemic and was compromised by fraud.</p> <p>ASEAN normally avoids entanglement in the internal politics of member states, but foreign ministers from the other members held an emergency meeting on Friday and decided to invite an unnamed “non-political representative” from Myanmar instead of Gen. Hlaing.</p> <p>Brunei, which currently holds the rotating chair of ASEAN, said the unusual step was taken because the junta has made “insufficient progress” on its promised roadmap back to a civilian government. Over 1,100 people have been killed during protests against the coup.</p> <p>“Some ASEAN member states recommended that ASEAN give space to Myanmar to restore its internal affairs and return to normalcy,” said the statement from the chair.</p> <p>Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said it was her country’s delegation that proposed the exclusion of Gen. Hlaing, arguing Myanmar should not be “represented at the political level” until it “restores its democracy through an inclusive process.”</p> <p>Malaysia also stated the junta should not be invited until there is “significant progress in the implementation of the five-point consensus” from ASEAN on returning power to elected officials.</p> <p>According to Radio Free Asia (RFA), several ASEAN member nations were irritated by Burmese military officials using their invitations to previous meetings as proof of the junta’s legitimacy in propaganda publications. Some members worried ASEAN itself would lose international legitimacy if it continued to entertain representatives from the coup.</p> <p>The junta said it was “extremely disappointed” in the decision, which it complained was “done without consensus” and was “against the objectives of ASEAN.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the junta claimed “foreign intervention” was involved in the decision, claiming that “envoys from some countries met with U.S. foreign affairs and received pressure from the European Union.”</p> <p>The junta’s opponents in Myanmar, on the other hand, applauded the snub.</p> <p>“ASEAN excluding Min Aung Hlaing is an important step, but we request that they recognize us as the proper representative,” a spokesman for the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) said on Monday.</p> <p>On Monday, Myanmar state television announced that over 5,600 people arrested for protesting against the coup would be freed and granted “amnesty.” Reuters quoted local political observers who said the prisoners were released to placate ASEAN, the United Nations, and other international organizations.</p> <p>The junta’s attempt to win friends was not terribly successful, as the U.N. insisted it was “outrageous” for any of the protesters to have been imprisoned or killed to begin with. Also, according to human rights groups, the junta promptly re-arrested dozens of the people it freed.</p>",4

899152474,An Open Letter to fellow Educators: Take a stand with Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning,2020-01-15 00:00:00,"<p>In the interests of journalistic freedom, truth and the rule of law, it is imperative that teachers in the US and internationally take a principled stance in defense of Julian Assange.</p> <p>Assange, the investigative journalist and founder of Wikileaks, is being held in Britain’s maximum-security Belmarsh prison in virtual solitary confinement. His health has deteriorated drastically since his imprisonment in May. In November, 60 doctors signed an open letter warning that he could die in prison. He is scheduled to appear in court in February for a hearing to determine whether the United Kingdom will extradite him to the United States where the government has prepared to charge him under the Espionage Act.</p> <p>Assange is guilty of nothing more than exposing to the world the US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the infamous Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails of 2016 that revealed the DNC acted illegally to thwart the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders for president. This political vendetta against a journalist, in opposition to international law, is being spearheaded by the US government, military and intelligence agencies.</p> <p>The government’s own documents brought to light by Wikileaks have demonstrated that all of the imperialist wars in the Middle East were based on lies. Only last week, Wikileaks released documents revealing serious objections from within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to the watchdog group’s public report of 2019 that blamed Syria’s Assad government for an alleged chlorine gas attack on the Syrian city of Douma in April 2018. The files released by Wikileaks not only suggest that evidence of a chemical attack was planted, but that photos of alleged victims, showing people foaming at the mouth, indicate these people exhibited signs of exposure to sarin gas, not chlorine. The Trump administration used the doctored OPCW report, released well after the fact, to justify the launching of a direct assault on Syria, where Russian forces were stationed in defense of the Assad regime. The attack could have triggered World War III.</p> <p>Exposures like this demonstrate just why the US ruling elite are so desperate to destroy Assange and whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning. It was Manning, then an Army private, who leaked over 750,000 classified and unclassified documents to Wikileaks implicating US forces in war crimes in Iraq, including the infamous “Collateral Murder” video. For her principled act, Manning was incarcerated and tortured in US military prisons. Although released in 2017, Manning is back in prison for refusing to testify against Assange.</p> <p>All defenders of democratic principles and rights should be concerned with the fates of Assange and Manning. A journalist and a whistleblower, they are being persecuted for revealing to the world the ugly truth about imperialist power.</p> <p>But why should teachers in particular come to their defense?</p> <p>As teachers know well, public education is under attack, in the US and internationally. This attack is not simply a matter of governmental cost cutting or the privatization of education through for-profit charter schools. The attack on education is an attack on the working class and especially the youth. A government that serves the interests of a wealthy elite fears nothing so much as truth, and the prospect of a truly educated population, capable of dismantling lies and discerning truth, is anathema to such a government. The persecution of Assange and Manning is part of this attack on truth and the working class.</p> <p>From overcrowded classrooms to outdated textbooks, from inadequate pay and benefits to dumbed-down curricula, teachers see firsthand the means by which the ruling elite carry out their war on public education. They have also seen how this war has been prosecuted by Democrats and Republicans alike, by Barack Obama and Arne Duncan as surely as by Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.</p> <p>Teachers have fought back valiantly in defense of education, not only in their everyday work in the classroom but over the past two years in the form of city-wide and even statewide strikes. These strikes have put demands for quality of education on a par with demands for better pay and benefits, and for this reason have seen overwhelming support from students and parents. But they have not been supported by the politically bankrupt teachers’ unions, which are part of the apparatus of the elite and whose chief purpose is to provide an ever-cheaper work force and to prevent strikes. Predictably, the unions have failed to issue any support to Assange and Manning, but instead are lining up behind various pro-war Democratic candidates for president.</p> <p>It is up to teachers to continue the struggle for education and truth, and this means a struggle independent of the traitorous unions. Teachers must form their own rank-and-file committees and join ranks with a whole new generation of students looking for a path of struggle against war and censorship.</p> <p>The defense of the courageous Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning is a responsibility of the working class.

999776787,"One year after the protests, workers in Belarus are still pushing for democracy and labour rights",2021-08-18 10:00:00,"<p>It has been over one year since the disputed presidential election took place in Belarus, but the disquieting aftershocks of 9 August continue to rumble on. The former Soviet state has been in turmoil ever since President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who has been in power for the past 27 years, claimed a landslide victory despite widespread evidence that the election was neither free nor fair and that opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was the likely winner.</p> <p>Before the election results were even announced, tens of thousands of people spontaneously gathered to peacefully protest the conduct of the election and to oppose the Lukashenko regime. The days that followed (9-11 August) were the most violent period in the country’s recent history: up to 7,000 protesters were arrested, many of them beaten and tortured by security forces, with three people dying at the hands of police. Then, between 17 and 18 August, workers across the country took part in strike action to support the democratic protests. Although protests continued until November, and despite international condemnation, Lukashenko refused to concede instead, more than 35,000 people have been arrested over the past year; opposition politicians, trade unionists, journalists, members of civil society, human rights lawyers and protesters have all been targeted with criminal prosecutions, and strict new laws have been introduced to further impede everything from press freedom to freedom of association. Scores of activists have fled the country, and dissents in exile have been kidnapped or found dead.</p> <p>Protests, walk-outs and work stoppages from workers at some of Belarus’s biggest heavy industries – such as Belaruskali, the world’s largest potash (potato fertiliser) producer, and the Minsk Wheeled Tractor Plant (MZKT), where Lukashenko was famously heckled by factory workers – played a key role in this moment.</p> <p>Workers formed strike committees to prepare for a general strike in support of democratic change. Their demands were simple: fresh elections, the release of all political prisoners, an independent investigation into police violence, a guarantee that protesting employees would not be persecuted by employers and state authorities, and an end to the system of short-term job contracts that dominates Belarus’s economy.</p> <p>On the one-year anniversary of the start of the protests, Julia Sliuko, a plasterer at Hrodnaprambud, a state-owned construction company in the western city of Grodno (also known as Hrodna), remembers the week that changed everything. Until last year, she says she was apolitical, focusing her energy on raising her 12-year-old son. But that changed last August when she witnessed police beat an unarmed man shortly after the disputed poll. Over the following days Julia spoke to co-workers, many of whom were also beaten by police, about current events. “After witnessing this violence, I understood that nothing would be the same anymore. I felt change in the air.” A few days later she would be elected as chairperson of her company’s strike committee and would later stand on stage in front of thousands of Grodno citizens to speak about how the company management tried to suppress the strike: “They tried to send us on vacation or even suggest money. But we are not for sale. We are with you,” she told the crowd.</p> <p>These spontaneous assemblies took place all over Belarus for several days in August, during which time dozens of enterprises saw workers going on strike. “We hoped that justice would prevail,” says Julia when asked why she and her colleagues went on strike. “We hoped that law enforcement would not continue to go against the people.” At Belaruskali, for example, which is one of the most successful state-owned companies in Belarus, almost 6,200 of the company’s 17,000 workers supported the idea of post-election strike action (although after coming under significant pressure, only 140 workers actually went on strike). On 10 September, Belaruskali miner and Belarusian Independent Trade Union (BITU) member Yury Korzun chained himself to a piece of mining equipment 305-metres below ground: “I wanted to inspire my colleagues to join the strike. How could I work, when the money we bring to this company goes to law enforcement, who beat peaceful people? To not take action is to put the life of my family at risk,” Yury tells Equal Times.</p> <p>“It wasn’t a strike, it was a revolt”</p> <p>President Lukashenko was elected as Belarus’s first post-Soviet president in 1994 and is currently serving his sixth term. Since he took power there has not been a free or fair election, there is no separation of power between the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature, the media is tightly muzzled, and opposition politicians and journalists are routinely jailed. It has become nearly impossible to publicly express political views which oppose Lukashenko’s: since 2019, protest organisers are obliged to provide local authorities with at least 10 days’ notice for any kind of rally; they also have to pay for utilities, medical assistance and police security, with the latter costing up to €2,500 for an assembly of more than 1,000 people. In a country where the average monthly salary is €473, this puts legal protests and rallies out of the reach of most working people.</p> <p>Organising an authorised strike is just as difficult. “Legally, there is the right to strike, but in reality, it is not feasible,” says Maxim Pazniakou, chairman of the BITU. Before calling a strike, a trade union must have exhausted all possible solutions, such as negotiations with the employer, which have no time limit according to law. For a strike to be legal, it must be backed by over 50 per cent of workers and organisers must approve the strike with several governmental bodies, giving them a minimum of two weeks’ notice. In addition, a strike can be deemed illegal by authorities at any stage. “In August last year, no one knew how to organise a strike, says Aliaksandar Yarashuk, president of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP). “The last one happened back in 1995. As a result, most active strikers were at those enterprises where independent trade unions are present. Because only they knew how to organise a strike,” he explains.</p> <p>When in August 2020 workers called for strike action in support of the pro-democracy protests, many employers responded by saying that because the workers’ demands were political and nothing to do with pay or working conditions, employers had no obligation to respond to their demands.</p> <p>However, as more than 65 per cent of all industrial products in Belarus are produced by fully or partially state-owned enterprises, the potential that workers have to use democratic organisations (trade unions) to advance democratic reform in the political sphere is significant. “What happened in August wasn’t a strike, it was more like a revolt. The state took all possibilities from workers to strike legally, but they still have the civil right to do so,” says Yarashuk. In response, the regime cracked down on striking workers with threats, arrests and sackings. For example, Julia from Hrodnaprambud was fired at the beginning of September. Dozens of her co-workers quit in solidarity.</p> <p>Most trade union members in Belarus (four million) belong to the state-aligned Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus (FTUB), a relic of the Soviet system complete with the participation of government ministers in the union’s decision-making bodies. About 10,000 workers are currently represented by the independent BKDP. Paradoxically, while in the aftermath of the pro-democracy uprising more and more workers are joining independent unions, these unions are operating in a shrinking space. As outlined in the 2021 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights Index: “Several union offices were raided [following the 9 August election], and the police have been forcing unions to hand over personal information about their members, causing serious concern about action against people who have exercised their right to join a union. Union representatives were abducted on their way to work by security services and subjected to interrogation and arbitrary detention. Workers were sentenced to long prison sentences for supporting strike action and protests.”</p> <p>According to new labour law amendments, which were brought into force this summer, strikes with political demands are now illegal. It is also forbidden to organise a strike at enterprises where hazardous manufacturing takes place and workers can now be fired for simply calling a strike. At its annual International Labour Conference in June 2020, the International Labour Organization (ILO) strongly criticised the violation of international labour standards taking place in Belarus, calling on the Belarusian authorities to reinstate workers, drop all charges related to participation in protests and to make new amendments to protect workers and trade union activists against discrimination, but Lukashenko’s government rejected the findings and today remains bullish. “We are running out of means to defend our members,” says Andrei Hanevich, leader of the independent trade union at GrodnoAzot, a chemical state-owned enterprise. “Employers can do anything they want.”</p> <p>“A modern form of slavery”</p> <p>Under Lukashenko, a raft of neoliberal labour laws have been brought in to create flexibility. For example, since 1999, Belarusian labour law has allowed for a maximum employment contract of just five years. As a result, many employers tend to extend contracts from year to year, which means workers have little to no job security and are constantly afraid of losing their jobs. On the other hand, employees cannot leave a job before the end of their contracted term, if an employer doesn‘t agree to it. “This system is one of the reasons why our labour code is one of the worst in Europe. We call it a modern form of slavery,” says Yarashuk.</p> <p>Moreover, according to the new amendments it is now legal to fire an individual if they serve an administrative term [editor’s note: in Belarusian law, offenses can be given criminal or administrative punishments, such as a fine or a short jail term]. For example, thousands of people were punished with up to 15 days imprisonment for taking part in demonstrations; under Belarusian labour law this is now treated as the sackable offense of truancy. “Last autumn many workers were fired due to their administrative term. We are suing many such employers because at that time it was illegal,” says Pazniakou. One such worker who got fired this way is the miner Yury Korzun. The day he chained himself underground was his last working day; he later served two 15-day prison terms in a row and in the winter, he spent a further month in prison.</p> <p>The majority of people who went on strike were fired from their jobs and many enterprises like GrodnoAzot have refused to extend the contracts of workers active in the protests. “Last year state enterprises fired people not because they were in breach of contract or for being unprofessional, but because they were politically disloyal,” says Yarashuk. The local branch of the BITU tried to initiate negotiations with factory management and persuade them to reinstate (according to the union) illegally fired employees. In July Belarusian media reported that GrodnoAzot need more than 350 workers. “There is definitely a big lack of staff. It looks like they have a list of people, with whom they will not extend contracts,” says Hanevich.</p> <p>The dissolution of independent trade unions?</p> <p>Independent trade unions are in a very precarious position in Belarus. Over the past few months authorities have practically destroyed the free media, arresting almost 30 journalists. More than 50 NGOs have been dissolved, among them not only human rights groups, but also charitable organisations. “We are expecting the dissolution of independent trade unions any moment now,” says Yarashuk. Last month the offices of the Belarusian Radio and Electronic Industry Workers’ Union were raided by the police and its chairperson was forced to leave the country. In addition, Mikola Sharah, the chairperson of the Free Trade Union of Belarus and human rights activist was arrested and detained for three days as a suspect in a criminal case about ‘damage of property’, resulting in the confiscation of his computers and mobile phones. “Recently our branches in the towns of Polatsk and Pinsk were refused to get registration. The same could happen in [the town of] Bobruisk,” says Sharah.</p> <p>Last autumn, hundreds of new members joined the independent trade unions, with – according to the BKPD – state trade unions losing about 20 per cent of their members. Some of those workers, like Siarhei Lapunou, joined independent structures instead. Lapunou worked at the state-owned oil refinery Naftan and used to be an FTUB member, but after the election he no longer wanted to support a pro-Lukashenko organisation: the chairperson of the FTUB, Mikhail Orda, managed Lukashenko’s election campaign and the union forced workers to sign for Lukashenko’s candidacy as presidential candidates need to gather at least 100,000 signatures.</p> <p>At Naftan, Lapunou says that many members of the independent trade union are discriminated against: they are threatened with dismissal and the deprivation of bonuses if they stay in the ‘wrong’ trade union.</p> <p>“Independent trade unions are great things, but only when they function in a state of law. In our country, the law doesn‘t work any more,” Lapunou laments.</p> <p>After protests broke out at state factories Lukashenko visited some of them himself and personally tried to calm down workers. He addressed workers on stage at MZKT, only to be told to “go away!” by some of the crowd. Of the incident, Yarashuk says: “Lukashenko understood that workers are the only force, thanks to which state power can be transferred peacefully. It was big psychological trauma for him at MZKT and we are still experiencing the consequences of this,” he says, citing labour law amendments and the repression faced by independent trade unions, union activists and workers as examples.</p> <p>So, with Lukashenko still in power one year later, did the strikes change anything? For Yarashuk, the strikes were successful in weakening Lukashenko’s political position. “He now knows that almost 70 per cent of the workers don’t trust the authorities.” There are other bright spots, too: some of the workers fired from Belaruskali have been reinstated showing that even in a repressive environment, gains can be achieved through collective action; and fledgling independent trade unions have been formed in the healthcare and education sectors.</p> <p>But overall, those who rose up against Lukashenko have paid a heavy price. Many new members of independent unions are under pressure from employers to leave, which keeps member numbers low, and the labour movement has lost many unions at many factories (such as the Minsk Automobile Plant and MZKT) because activists and members were fired since August 2020. Yarashuk is positive that now that the seed of independent trade unions has been planted, at some point they will flourish: “They can dissolve the unions, but they can’t destroy the idea.”</p> <p>In the meantime, many of the strikers have been forced to leave the country. Julia Sliuko went to Poland with her son in October last year to avoid a jail term. She now works as a manicurist and organises protests in the Polish capital of Warsaw. Siarhei Lapunou from Naftan left for Poland two months ago, and together with other strikers, he survives by doing odd jobs. One of his friends, Valery, who also took part in the 2020 strikes, is a father of three children, one of whom has a disability. Although things aren’t easy in Poland, he plans to remain in exile until Lukashenko is gone: “I know we will return to Belarus some day, but I understand that victory may not come soon.”</p>",4

885531401,The Martyrs of Balochistan,2019-11-09 00:00:00,"<p>By Aaliyah Shah</p> <p>Martyrs are those who sacrifice their lives voluntary for a noble cause, those who refused to renounce a country, religion or other beliefs. A who person suffers greatly or dies for the nation or motherland rather than give up and the ones never accept slavery can die willingly for the motherland, that become Martyrs.</p> <p>Martyrs devote their everything for their nation, motherland and other beliefs. Similarly, in Balochistan there are have been lots of selfless sons and daughters, whom we regards as national martyrs, have sacrificed their precious lives for their motherland. The Baloch Martyrs Day is on 13 November 1839 – the day when British colonial forces attack Balochistan and the Baloch ruler of the time Mr Mehrab Khan chose martyrdom over surrender and slavery. It is day of great pride for Baloch nation as Mir Mehrab Khan and his comrades resisted against the British army and had fought bravely against them till the end of their lives, but they did not quite the battle or run away from the battlefield.</p> <p>He surely knew that it was not easy to defeat an army armed with sophisticated weapons and in large number and kept the culture of resistance alive and did not submit before the might of enemy forces. He greatly fought and embraced martyrdom on 13 November 1839.</p> <p>This was not the first and last Baloch resistance or foreign attack against Balochistan because after the British left their legacy of divide and rule or weaken and occupy remained intact. Pakistan and Iran begun their expansionism and evil designs against Baloch nation. Even though the British had divided Balochistan but before leaving the sub-continent, they recognised the independence of Eastern part of Balochistan (currently occupied by Pakistan).</p> <p>The freedom, however, was short-lived because the British brainchild Pakistan started its conspiracy and eventually occupied Balochistan in March 1948 after the Baloch nation overwhelmingly rejected to merge their country with Pakistan on the basis of religion. Hence, the Baloch war of liberation was once again intensified.</p> <p>Even today, the Baloch brave sons and daughters are sacrificing their lives for the freedom and a dignified future. The Pakistani and Iranian intelligence agencies and armies are committing war crimes in Balochistan by using excessive force and brutalities but the resolve and determination of brave Baloch fighters is unbreakable. Those of young men, women and children who have been martyred for Balochistan.</p> <p>Thousands of brightest and educated people in Balochistan including journalists, writers, teachers, leaders, students have been abducted and disappeared for years, tortured and killed in custody by Pakistani forces. An example is the case of Abdul Hameed Hayathan Baloch, a young journalist who was abducted from Gwadar on 25 October 2010 and on November 18 his body was found beside the river Sami in Turbat area of district Kech in Balochistan. The body of a student, Hamid Ismail was alongside Hayathan Baloch’s found on Eid day and a massage found with the bodies that” Eid present for Baloch people” these were the words of Pakistani forces. This act of sheer savageness by Pakistani forces shows their hatred against Baloch nation and their frightfulness from the educated Baloch youth.</p> <p>Furthermore, on 26 April, a Baloch artist Minhaj Mukhtar was attacked by Pakistani forces fire and terrorised his family members including women and children. On June 1st Saba Dashtyari, a professor at the University of Balochistan and one of the greatest poets and writers was shot by unidentified gunmen in the provincial capital Quetta, in a public place. As like on 10 Feb 2011, Jamil Yaqub’s body were bearing marks of torture was found on the outskirts of Turbat.</p> <p>Moreover, the Pakistani and Iranian state crimes have become so common in Balochistan that with the passage of time the number of Baloch martyrs continue to increase. Baloch women children, elderly and people from all spheres of life are being killed in Balochistan only for raise voice for the freedom of their motherland and being Baloch. The occupiers of Baloch nation on both sides of the artificial border are killing Baloch indiscriminately.</p> <p>Today, Balochistan feels proud to have brave sons and daughters who are willing to die for their for the freedom and dignity of their motherland. The culture of resistance ignited by Mir Mehrab Khan, Agha Abdul Karim and Babo Nourz Khan has been continued by thousands of other martyrs and will their legacy will continue till their mission of regaining Balochistan’s independence is fulfilled.</p> <p>Every martyr deserves praising, A huge great salute to all those martyrs who have devoted their priceless lives….. a cruel rule before death. As it is said the martyrs remain immoral and their death is the begging of the life of their nation. Martyrs live forever – Shahmeer Nameeran ant.</p>",4

972955560,Guantanamo Bay is America's enduring shame,2021-03-05 00:00:00,"<p>On 12 February, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked by a reporter whether the new Joe Biden administration intends to shut down the notorious Guantanamo Bay Prison by the end of the US president's first term in office. Her non-committal answer was, ""That's certainly our goal and our intention.""</p> <p>Psaki may have sounded reassuring that the untold suffering experienced by hundreds of men in this American gulag — many of whom were surely innocent — would finally be coming to an end. However, considering the history of Guantanamo and the trail of broken promises by the Barack Obama administration, the latest ""goal and intention"" is hardly encouraging.</p> <p>Compare the new language with that of Obama's impassioned diatribes about humanity, justice and American values, which he utilised whenever he spoke of Guantanamo. ""Gitmo has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law,"" Obama said in a speech at the National Defence University in May 2013.</p> <p>Enamoured with his every word, Obama's audience applauded enthusiastically, but when he delivered that particular speech, he was serving his second term in office. He had already had ample time and opportunity to shut down the prison which operates with no international monitoring and entirely outside the realms of international and US laws.</p> <p>Obama is likely to be remembered for his words, not his actions. Not only did he fail to shut down the prison which was erected by his predecessor, George W. Bush, in 2002, but the Guantanamo industry also continued to thrive during his time in the White House. For example, in his speech, Obama made reference to the high cost of ""a hundred and fifty million dollars each year to imprison 166 people."" According to the New Yorker in 2016, Guantanamo's budget had grown to ""$445 million"" while Obama was in office.</p> <p>READ: Barack Obama and the shattered hopes of a new Middle East</p> <p>Yet, as the budget grew by leaps and bounds, the number of Guantanamo prisoners dwindled. There are now just 40 prisoners in the massive edifice of metal, concrete and barbed wire built within a US naval base at the eastern tip of Cuba on land 'leased' by the US in 1903.</p> <p>It is easy to conclude that the US government keeps the prison open only to avoid international accountability and, arguably, to extract information by torture, an act that is inconsistent with American law. But this cannot be right. The wars against Afghanistan and Iraq were illegal under international law, but that didn't stop the US and its allies from savagely invading, humiliating and torturing entire populations with no regard whatsoever to legal or moral arguments.</p> <p>Moreover, Guantanamo is merely one of many American-run prisons and detention centres operating around the world according to the most ruthless tactics and no rule book. The tragedy of Abu Ghraib, a US military detention centre in Baghdad, only became famous when direct evidence of the degrading and incredibly violent conduct that was taking place within its walls was produced and publicised. Furthermore, many US officials and members of Congress at the time used the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2004 as an opportunity to whitewash and rebrand American crimes elsewhere and to present the misconduct within the prison as if it was an isolated incident involving ""a few bad apples"".</p> <p>This argument was made by George W Bush. It was more or less the same logic utilised by Obama when he championed the closure of Guantanamo. Indeed, both presidents insisted that neither Abu Ghraib nor Guantanamo should be made out to represent what America is really all about.</p> <p>""Is this who we are?"" asked Obama passionately as he made the case for the closure of Guantanamo, speaking as if he was a human rights advocate rather than the Commander-in-Chief with the authority to shut down the entire facility immediately. The truth is that the Abu Ghraib tortures were not ""a few bad apples"" and Guantanamo is, indeed, a microcosm of exactly what the US is, or has become.</p> <p>From Bagram in Afghanistan, to Abu Ghraib in Iraq, to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, to the many ""floating prisons"" — news of which was leaked by US media in 2014 — the US government continues to make a mockery of international and humanitarian laws. Many American officials who genuinely advocate the closure of Guantanamo refuse to acknowledge that the prison is a symbol of their country's intransigence, and refuse to accept that, like any other country in the world, it is accountable to international law.</p> <p>This lack of accountability has exceeded the US government's insistence on ""acting alone"" and launching wars without international mandates. One US administration after another has also made it clear that, under no circumstances, would they allow American citizens accused of war crimes to be investigated, let alone stand trial, before the International Criminal Court (ICC). The message here is that even America's ""few bad apples"" can potentially walk free, regardless of the heinousness of their crimes.</p> <p>Just months after the Trump administration imposed punitive sanctions on ICC judges for having the audacity to look into possible investigations of US crimes in Afghanistan, it freed the convicted criminals who carried out horrific crimes in Iraq. On 22 December, Trump pardoned four American mercenaries from the private military company Blackwater. These convicted murderers were involved in the killing of 14 civilians, including two children, in Baghdad in 2007.</p> <p>READ: The protests may reveal America's social and political decay, but don't expect another revolution</p> <p>What became known as the ""Nisour Square massacre"" was another example of whitewashing, as government officials and mainstream media insisted that the massacre was an isolated episode, even while expressing outrage at the unlawful killing. The fact that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, mostly civilians, were killed as a result of the US invasion seems irrelevant in America's skewed logic as it pursues its never-ending ""war on terror"".</p> <p>Whether Biden fulfils his promise to shut down Guantanamo or not, little will change if the US remains committed in its contempt for international law and to its undeserved view of itself as a country that exists above the universal rights of everyone else.</p> <p>That said, Guantanamo on its own is a crime against humanity and there can never be any rational explanation or justification for holding hundreds of people indefinitely, without trial, without due process, without international observers and without ever seeing their families and loved ones. The explanation often offered by the pro-Guantanamo pundits is that the prison inmates are dangerous men. If that was indeed the case, why were these supposed criminals not allowed to have their day in court?</p> <p>According to a report by Amnesty International published in May last year, of the 779 men who were taken to the prison, ""only seven have been convicted"". Worse, five of them were convicted ""as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty, in return for the possibility of release from the base."" According to the rights group, such a trial by military commission ""did not meet fair trial standards"".</p> <p>In other words, Guantanamo is — and has always been — a fraudulent operation with no real inclination to hold criminals and terrorists to account and prevent further crimes. Guantanamo is an industry, and a lucrative one. In many ways, it is similar to the American prison military complex, ironically dubbed the ""criminal justice system"". Referring to the unjust ""justice system"", Human Rights Watch derided the US for having ""the largest reported prison population in the world"".</p> <p>""The (US) criminal justice system — from policing and prosecution, through to punishment — is plagued with injustices like racial disparities, excessively harsh sentencing and drug and immigration policies that improperly emphasise criminalisation,"" stated HRW on its website.</p> <p>The above can also be considered an answer to Obama's rhetorical question, ""Is this who we are?"" Yes sir, Mr President, this is precisely who you are.</p> <p>While offering the world's most miserable detention conditions to hundreds of potentially innocent men, Guantanamo also offers career opportunities, military perks and honours, and a seemingly endless budget for a small army to guard only a few shackled, gaunt-looking men in a foreign land.</p> <p>Even if Biden is able to overcome pressure from the military, the CIA and Congress and succeeds in shutting Guantanamo down, justice will still be absent, not only because of the numerous lives that are forever shattered, but also because America still refuses to learn from its mistakes. Guantanamo Bay Prison is indeed America's enduring shame.</p> <p>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.</p>",4
1019189226,Police wait for Supreme Court ruling on investigations into events in Troubles,2021-12-15 02:53:11,"<p>Senior officers are waiting for a Supreme Court ruling on whether the Police Service of Northern Ireland is sufficiently independent to carry out investigations into two events during the Troubles in Ulster half a century ago.</p> <p>Seven justices based in London heard arguments, at a Supreme Court hearing in June, relating to proposed police investigations into the killing of a Catholic woman in 1972 and the treatment of 12 people, who have become known as the “hooded men”, detained in 1971.</p> <p>Lord Hodge, Lord Lloyd-Jones, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Hamblen, Lord Leggatt, and Lord Burrows were asked to consider issues relating to the shooting of 24-year-old Jean Smyth in Belfast and the detention of the “hooded men”, following rulings by judges in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>They are scheduled to deliver a ruling on Wednesday.</p> <p>A barrister representing Mrs Smyth’s sister, Margaret McQuillan, and Francis McGuigan, one of the “hooded men”, had told judges that the cases were of the “utmost seriousness”.</p> <p>Hugh Southey QC said one case concerned the fatal shooting of an “unarmed young mother”, in circumstances “implicating British Army personnel”.</p> <p>He said the other concerned “state-sanctioned torture and/or inhuman and degrading treatment”.</p> <p>Mr Southey said two issues arose in both cases, the “applicability of investigatory obligation” imposed by articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and the independence of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>He argued that Mrs Smyth’s sister and Mr McGuigan were entitled to “effective, independent investigation” and told judges that the Police Service of Northern Ireland lacked the “requisite independence to investigate”.</p> <p>Barrister Tony McGleenan QC, who represented the Police Service of Northern Ireland, told judges that the force did not lack the independence to investigate.</p> <p>Amnesty International has said that the “hooded men” case will be “hugely significant” to “torture victims across the world” and to the ongoing “unresolved issue of legacy of the troubles”.</p>",4
960017678,Ruhollah Zam: 27 July 1978 – 12 December 2020 - Index on Censorship,2020-12-16 20:05:59,"<p>On Saturday 12 December, the founder of the Telegram news channel Amadnews, Ruhollah Zam, was hanged in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison.</p> <p>Zam was born in Shahr-e-Rey, just outside Tehran, in 1978. He first came to prominence in 2009 after the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he was jailed for voicing his opposition.</p> <p>In 2011, after his release from prison, Zam, together with his wife and young daughter Niaz fled the country and were granted asylum in France, living initially in Paris before moving to a small town near Toulouse after he received threats.</p> <p>Two and a half years ago, Zam co-founded the Amadnews channel on Telegram, which is hugely popular in Iran – it has 50 million users there and was reported at one point to account for 60% of the country’s entire internet usage.</p> <p>Amadnews became popular for its criticism of Iran’s leaders and informed descriptions on the 2017 protests, which started as a protest against the economic policies of the government before developing into wider protests against Iran’s leaders. Twenty-five people died during the nationwide protests.</p> <p>The channel grew quickly to have a million subscribers but at the end of 2017 Telegram shut it down saying the channel had called for armed uprisings. The channel reappeared under a new same, Sedaiemardom (voice of the people), just a few months later.</p> <p>The story of how he even came to be in Iran again is mysterious.</p> <p>In 2019, it is believed that he was lured to Iraq from his exile in France to meet the grand Ayatollah Sistani, the spiritual leader of the Iraqi Shia Muslims. While there, he was captured by agents of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps which issued a statement saying he had been detained “in a complicated operation”.</p> <p>The statement said: “Despite being under the guidance of the French intelligence service and the support of the US and Zionist intelligence services…, and being guarded round the clock by various means and covers, he fell into a trap laid by… the IRGC’s Intelligence Organization.”</p> <p>He was thrown into Evin prison and tortured for months and forced to make televised confessions of his ‘crimes’.</p> <p>In June this year, Zam was tried in front of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran, presided over by Judge Abolqasem Salav and convicted on 13 counts of “spreading corruption on earth”. He was sentenced to death.</p> <p>Despite going to appeal, on 8 December, the supreme court announced it had upheld the death sentence.</p> <p>Zam’s father, the moderate cleric Mohammad Ali Zam, has revealed on Instagram what happened after the sentence was confirmed.</p> <p>Last Friday, he was telephoned by an Iranian intelligence agent who said he could come and visit his son in the notorious Evin prison but not to tell him that the sentence for execution had been confirmed. His father reports that during the visit the family started to cry and the agent was afraid that Ruhollah might find out why and told him.</p> <p>“Don’t worry Ruhollah. These are happy tears from visiting you. Even if the execution is confirmed, the process would take a while to be carried out and we will inform you of the whole process.”</p> <p>On Saturday 12 December at 8am French time, his eldest daughter Niaz received a WhatsApp call from a number she didn’t recognise. It was her father.</p> <p>They talked about her studies and getting her diploma but after five minutes the call had to end and her father said goodbye. There was a finality in his tone and Niaz knew this would be the last time they would speak.</p> <p>آخرین تماس، حجت قیامت شنبه ساعت ١ بامداد در فرانسه و ٣:٣٠</p> <p>بامداد به وقت ايران.</p> <p>يه تماسي با من ميشه تو واتس آپ از شماره اي كه نميشناسم چون اين شماره با ٤٤+ شروع ميشد.</p> <p>اولين بار جواب ندادم قطع كردم</p> <p>گوشيم دوباره زنگ خورد و جواب دادم. ادامه در کامنت اول.. pic.twitter.com/S7cGxuBIKA — niaz zam (@niaz670) December 17, 2020</p> <p>Just a few hours later, Zam was paraded in front of television cameras and hanged.</p> <p>There has been widespread condemnation of his execution.</p> <p>United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement, “The international community must continue to hold the regime accountable for its unconscionable actions…The Iranian people deserve a free and diverse media, not censorship, arrests, and the execution of journalists.”</p> <p>The European Union said it “condemns this act in the strongest terms and recalls once again its irrevocable opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances. It is also imperative for the Iranian authorities to uphold the due process rights of accused individuals and to cease the practice of using televised confessions to establish and promote their guilt.”</p> <p>Masih Alinejad, author of The Wind in My Hair: My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran and who had campaigned to prevent the execution of young Iranian wrestler Navid Afkari, told Index, “By killing Zam, the Islamic Republic has shown that it is not interested in diplomacy. It is ironic that Zam was named after Rohallah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, an evil system that is not willing to tolerate dissent from journalists. Zam was a media pioneer who created the most influential news channel in recent memory.”</p> <p>Javaid Rehman, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Agnes Callamard, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said: “The conviction and execution of Mr Zam are unconscionable. The reports of his arrest, his treatment in detention, and the process of his trial, as well as the reasons for his targeting by the Iranian authorities, are a serious violation of Iran’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to life.</p> <p>“It is clear that Ruhollah Zam was executed for expressing opinions and providing information on AmadNews that dissented from the official views of the Iranian Government.”</p> <p>Index on Censorship’s CEO Ruth Smeeth has written a letter to the UN Secretary General condemning Zam’s murder.</p> <p>She wrote: “Press freedom is a pillar of democracy. When journalists are targeted, all of society pays the price. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the right to freedom of opinion and expression to all…As a journalist, as a human rights activist, as a global citizen Ruhollah Zam should have been protected by the state of his birth, not murdered by them.”</p> <p>Ruhollah Zam is survived by his wife Mahsa Razani and their two daughters.</p>",4
907507995,The Dark Web of Child Porn,2020-03-02 00:00:00,"<p>Last October, Prajwala, a Hyderabad-based NGO that rescues and rehabilitates sex trafficking survivors, came across some disturbing footage of child pornography on the internet. When Sunitha Krishnan, co-founder of Prajwala, went to meet a child featured in it, she expected a scared, silent, suspicious person. Instead, she found a cherubic 12-year-old girl, bursting with enthusiasm. Praniti (name changed) was no problem child. She attended school, was polite and never begged for chips or soda. She would chat with a close friend online, someone her parents assumed was from school. Nothing prepared them for the discovery that the person was a stranger and that sexually explicit photographs of their daughter were all over the internet. Praniti's reaction was different. There was only denial. ""She was adamant this person was her friend, that she had done nothing wrong,"" says Krishnan. The biggest threat in children being 'groomed' through the internet is the complete transfer of trust from the prey to the predator. It destroys the construct of victimhood in a child's mind. ""The child doesn't know he or she is being exploited. Imagine a childhood spent grappling with the notion of betrayal and abuse,"" says Krishnan.</p> <p>Cyber grooming of the very young, like Praniti, is the newest threat in a booming online child pornography market that has reached alarming proportions in India (see Perverse Patterns). According to the US-based National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), India now accounts for the maximum number of online child sexual abuse imagery in the world, followed by Thailand. NCMEC estimates that Indian users have uploaded 25,000 images or videos in just the past five months. Delhi tops the list for the maximum uploads of child porn, followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. ""Innovation and the internet come with their own set of challenges, some of which are alarming as in child pornography,"" says Dr Gulshan Rai, chief information security officer in the prime minister's office. ""The IT Act bans the viewing, creation and distribution of child pornography in the country, but it still happens. Moreover, intermediaries like social networks are not removing such content fast enough. They are not owning up to their responsibility towards society, focusing instead on revenue and maximum visibility.""</p> <p>Indian users have uploaded 25,000 images or videos in just the past five months. Delhi tops the list.</p> <p>Anyonea family member, criminal racket or cyber strangercan create child porn. They need not be paedophiles. ""We are seeing an increase in self-generated child porn,"" says Sidd-harth Pillai, co-founder of Aarambh, which runs a helpline for reporting child porn. Government figures also show that circulation of child porn is on the rise. Last year, 377 websites were blocked in India for posting child porn content. According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, 781 cases of creating or storing child porn were recorded in 2018. In 2017, it had been 331 cases. Odisha had the maximum number of such cases (333) in 2018, as opposed to only eight in 2017. ""Much of child abuse footage is filmed inside homes by known relatives or family friends. This could happen anywhereurban, rural, poor, rich. There would also be an offline apparatus where victims of sex trafficking could be filmed,"" says Pillai.</p> <p>Source: The latest transparency reports of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram</p> <p>Reports show that approximately 100 people have been arrested or summoned for viewing and distributing child porn across the country since November 2019. Additionally, Gujarat's Crime Investigation Department received names of 62 paedophiles in the same month. In October 2019, the CBI filed cases against seven Indians involved in an international child sex racket. What is not mentioned is whether these same people also create content. According to the NCRB, one child is sexually abused every 15 minutes in India. While there is no single figure for how much of this happens within homes, those working with victims and several independent studies estimate that 70-90 per cent of all child abuse is perpetrated by people known to the child. ""Often couples or child abusers film their acts, and this content gets leaked. There is also grave concern over children being groomed to participate in sexual activities through social media friends,"" says Pillai. Child sex abuse is not just traumatic in a person's formative years, it creates a cycle of abuse. According to a 2008 study in the International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 'pathological family atmosphere with precocious exposures to sexual behaviours and sexual acts, traumatic sexual experiences in childhood, sexual interests and exploration, deprivation and failure in romantic relationships, and young boys who have been coerced into homosexual acts, are at increased risk of becoming young sexual offenders.'</p> <p>There are also reports of an offline, unorganised child porn industry, perhaps a subset of the larger organised porn industry in India. ""Sexual abuse also exists where trafficking does,"" says Krishnan. One can assume child sexual imagery could be beginning in areas that are hubs of trafficking-West Bengal, Rajasthan, Maharasthra being the top three, shows NCRB data.</p> <p>Alarmed by the reports, Rajya Sabha chairman and vice-president Venkaiah Naidu set up a committee under the leadership of the Congress's Jairam Ramesh in December 2019. The 14-member committee met with social media firms and representatives from the women and child development, electronics & IT and home affairs ministries to discuss two key issues: children accessing pornographic material and the circulation of child porn. Around 40 recommendations were submitted in the final report last month. At present, instances of child porn are not reported to a governing body or recorded and made public by social media companies, a practice the same firms follow in the US. The US also has cyber crime teams that monitor and track down child porn creators based on these reports. The Rajya Sabha report has recommended that a central body be set up to whom online platforms can report IP addresses of those searching for child porn. While the panel did consider several legislative, technological and institutional measures for those viewing and promoting child porn, it did not include how content creators or those advocating sexual activities to children online will be tracked. The menace is largely to be dealt with on visible circulation channels. And while digital safety education was recommended, nothing was mentioned on sex education for children to be more aware of their bodies and rights. The report's impact on lawmakers and subsequent implementation of the recommendations remains to be seen.</p> <p>While the electronics & IT ministry had earlier recommended that automated tools weed out terrorism and child porn, it is likely that the final draft of the guidelines for IT intermediaries will mandate only child porn be monitored and removed. The final call on revised guidelines is expected in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Among the people the committee consulted and who also helped draft the final report was Amol Deshmukh of research outfit Herd Foundation. ""Online exploitation of children is a major concern,"" he says. ""We have recommended that cyber grooming, advocating or counselling sexual activities with a person under 18, be made an offence under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. We also discussed setting up a cyber-crime investigative agency in India, especially to monitor the dark web, where a major chunk of child porn is viewed."" However, monitoring of online criminal marketplaces, like the dark web, did not make it to the final Rajya Sabha report.</p> <p>The dark web</p> <p>Social media giants are beginning to act against child pornography in India. In February 2019, the company website stated that 'over the last three months, WhatsApp has banned approximately 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery'. YouTube removed 851,441 videos citing child safety concerns between July and September 2019. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, too, removed millions of such images and videos last year. However, this is just the trackable surface web. What is available on the dark web can never be fully documented. Playpen, a dark website the FBI shut down in 2015, had 215,000 users and 23,000 sexually explicit images of children, even toddlers.</p> <p>India is currently among the top 10 countries logging on to the dark web, according to metrics released by the TOR Project, an open-source software for enabling anonymous communication (50,000 Indians logged on daily as of January 2020). Figures can fluctuate depending on how people access the network, and how they cover their tracks. In 2014, the figure was over 200,000 a day for India. According to Hyderabad-based ethical hacker Bharat Rao, ""It is now very simple for people to hide their location, thanks to online tutorials and virtual private networks. This makes it harder to track actual user numbers. I don't think the figures since 2014 have reduced, people are just accessing the dark web differently and more covertly.""</p> <p>Tracking a single user on the dark web can take 3-4 months. For websites, much more.</p> <p>Unlike the surface web, where websites are indexed on search engines, the dark web helps sites achieve total anonymity. Software like TOR directs internet traffic through hundreds of virtual tunnels. These tunnels are created between nodes (or relays). Each time data is transmitted, a random route is picked between these nodes. TOR also goes a step further and deploys the 'onion routing' of data. Imagine driving from Delhi to Jaipur-instead of taking the direct NH-48, you drive through a number of other towns and cities to reach it. None of the cities will know which other city you visited except the one before and after it. And each time you go, you take a different route. This is essentially how a user connects to the deep web; the convoluted, hidden route maintains blanket secrecy.</p> <p>A user can access the dark web very simply. All one has to do is download a TOR browser (available as an app on smartphones and downloadable on desktops), and connect. On the deep web, there is no Google. Instead, you have search engines like The Hidden Wiki, Duck Duck Go and TOR Links. These will not show you any results for child porn, which is 'officially' banned just as on the surface web, complying with the guidelines of the offline world. However, logging on to specialised encrypted search engines like Onion Land and Onion Dir takes you to a different world. On Onion Land alone, a search for 'child porn' throws up over 130 website links, and a search for 'child porn India' around 50. There are websites which sell children as slaves, host videos of child torture, images of children with aggressive animals and of children taking nude selfies. A search for 'nude child Indian' on Onion Land reveals 42 links, and one listed images by caste, state, colour, gender and age.</p> <p>Rather than names, websites on the dark web are a random alphanumeric sequence strung together with the domain name '.onion'. For example, a link describing 'india child stripping to bra' was 'jnsbixyz32lsex82nm.onion'. Transactions to access such content are made in Bitcoin. On jnsbixyz32lsex82nm.onion, the price to view five images was about Rs 6,000 in Bitcoin. To gauge the popularity and cost-effectiveness of these links, you only have to visit the various crowdfunding platforms for child porn. One website-uh3xkebozq5n6ygv.onion (listed on a Reddit forum)-lets you view images and videos only after 500 users have paid around Rs 800 in Bitcoin.</p> <p>The centre has banned child porn, but is yet to set up a dedicated agency to investigate cases.</p> <p>Content is also sold on the hundreds of marketplaces of the deep web. Popular ones include Empire, Berlusconi, Cave to R, Black Mart, Dream and Elite. Most of the products on sale here are drugs or weapons. All marketplaces have the disclaimer that selling child porn is banned. And it is indeed not a product for transaction, until you start a chat. Encrypted, chats are where cyber groomers peddle content. On Elite, a buyer for static images quoted the following rates: 'Child Front: Rs 4,000/ Child Back: Rs 6,000' (rupee equivalents of Bitcoin). More can be offered for videos, children with objects, children with other children, or children with adults. These chat rooms are heavily monitored-even something as inconspicuous as taking a screenshot of a conversation can trigger off an alert, and instant blocking out.</p> <p>Currently, India does not have the resources to crack down on such operations. ""The dark web cannot be regulated and it will require a full-fledged investigative agency to even try. At present, we don't even have one for the surface web,"" says Mukesh Choudhary, a cyber crime expert who has trained close to 5,000 armed forces officials and police in India on cyber crime investigations. ""Hunting for users through the dark web is very hard,"" he adds. ""Websites change links, people hide locations, routes of data transfer are hidden and different each time."" Rai makes a similar point: ""The dark web is extremely time-consuming to regulate. At times, it can be impossible."" Tracking a single user on the dark web can take 3-4 months; tracking a website even more. A US-South Korea crackdown on a child porn dark website called Welcome to Video took over two years. Transactions in cryptocurrency, onion routing, encrypted chats and Protonmail (which also cannot be tracked) are the biggest hurdles for dark web investigators.</p> <p>The road ahead</p> <p>Various stakeholders are involved in child protection, each playing a different role. Social media platforms are clear there is zero tolerance for any kind of child abuse. A Twitter India spokesperson says, ""We have been at the forefront of responding to the challenge of preventing the exploitation of children on the internet and will continue to fight online child sexual abuse and invest in essential technology and tools."" What these tools are, the company is unwilling to divulge.</p> <p>ShareChat, however, is open to sharing that they use artificial intelligence (AI) to detect child porn. ""AI tools usually detect skin or movement. Some videos have only audio, or the bottom half will be cut off to trick the AI,"" admits Berges Malu, public policy head at ShareChat. A similar problem with AI has been detected on Facebook too. Krishnan tried to report a group called Kochu Sundarikal (Little Pretty One), an English-Malayalam community of 3,000 paedophiles openly discussing child abuse. The AI could not spot a 'community guideline violation' because it was in a vernacular language. Similarly, Ankit Mitra (name changed), 31, a cyber hacker from Ahmedabad, says he recently helped bust a WhatsApp group called Bhabiji ghar pe hai, where 150 paedophiles shared images and links to child porn on the dark web. Despite consultations with social media companies, the government has not mandated accountability or punitive measures for failure to remove or report content.</p> <p>The government has banned child porn but is yet to set up a dedicated agency to investigate cases of those who view, distribute and create it. There is a general consensus on the ineffectiveness of moral bans. ""Generally, harm reduction is a more successful approach because even if pornography is banned, people are likely to continue watching (as they have for centuries). Typically, a ban does not stop use, it just moves use into the shadows and stigmatises the behaviour, which is antithetical to the goal of decreasing negative health effects,"" says Kimberly M. Nelson, professor, Boston University, and co-author of the study, 'Pornography is not a public health crisis'. Public shaming or humiliation is often used as a deterrent for crime in China and some American states. Psychiatrists, behaviouralists and even judges are divided on whether this is an effective form of discipline, though it's viewed as a stronger message than moral policing. The justice system, however, needs to be speedy and robust for such punishments to have an impact.</p> <p>Experts recommend sex education, so that children know their bodies-and their rights.</p> <p>A blind eye is being turned towards sexual education, even though academics argue for its benefits in deterring child abuse. ""Children need to be educated about sex. If they know about their bodies, they knows about their rights,"" says S.K. Khandelwal, head of psychiatry, AIIMS, Delhi. Chennai-based sexologist Prakash Kothari, who has been practising for 48 years, thinks likewise. ""I have seen the age of puberty speed up from 14 years to 11 now. This is largely because of exposure to sexual content through movies, news, songs, social media, chatrooms etc. However, the mind still matures at age 21. This is why it is imperative for schools to educate children about their bodies, to help them understand exploitation,"" says Kothari.</p> <p>Arun Kapur, director of Delhi's Vasant Valley School, says, ""Parents need to be parents, not friends. Discipline and awareness about digital safety begins at home. There is only so much schools can do. Most children today are on phones even before they start school,"" says Kapur. Indeed, parents are the first responders here. In the UK, Papaya Parents, a collective of concerned parents who wish to battle phone, porn and internet addiction among their kids, advises being involved with children, having open discussions and clear guidelines on usage. Many also access their kids' social media accounts, and will monitor it till they turn 18. India has no such support group.</p> <p>Despite media scrutiny and suggestions for stricter legal measures, creation of, and access to, child pornography has never been simpler. In 1991, when Freddy Peats was arrested for sexually exploiting children at his Goa orphanage, the police discovered 2,305 porn photographs of minor boys engaged in sexual acts with white men and 135 film negatives of child porn in his possession. What took Peats 20 years to achieve can now be done in a few weeks. A search on a dark website reveals 300,000 images of children being forced to engage in sexual acts with other children, children being tortured by adults, being bitten by animals and nude selfies of young schoolgirls and boys. This is the threat of the internet, where the hunter and the hunted exist on the same platform with nothing to distinguish one from the other. With close to 66 million children from India scouring the web every day (according to a 2019 study by the Internet and Mobile Association of India), each one is at risk of becoming a silent victim in an advancing pornography market.</p> <p>Perverse patterns</p> <p>Child predators often spend weeks building connections with their victims, normalising the watching of porn before manipulating them into making such material themselves</p> <p>The cyber grooming of children by predators-the befriending of children online with the explicit intention of later sexual exploitation-is spreading with alarming rapidity in India. And what often goes largely unreported in India is the evolving modus operandi of such predators.</p> <p>""The victims are those who are 'struggling' in some way,"" says Shelja Sen, child psychologist and family therapist. ""They could be lonely, failing in academics, dealing with parental strife, born with a disability, isolated from others their age... these are the kids who are singled out and approached."" Through a process that involves stalking their victims on social media and spinning a compelling narrative as bait, cyber groomers appear to rely heavily on gaming forums and chatrooms to develop emotional connections with their victims. ""They don't care if the child is rich or poor, urban or rural, male or female. They will look for signs [of vulnerability], such as posts about loneliness or weight issues or health conditions-anything that suggests the child is alienated and craves social connection,"" explains Sunitha Krishnan, co-founder of Prajwala.</p> <p>70 per cent of boys in Grade 9 watched 6 porn videos a week on average, according to one estimate.</p> <p>This was clearly visible in the case of 14-year-old Heena (name changed). Heena, a student from Lucknow, had often disclosed to other players on Fortnite (an online video game that has a chat window where players can text each other) how miserable she was because her parents were getting a divorce. It was here that an online predator-'Mudita'-found her.</p> <p>Illustration by Nilanjan Das</p> <p>Mudita later approached Heena on Facebook, and over the weeks that followed, manipulated her into believing they had a great deal in common. Mudita would post about her own parents getting a divorce, and after she found out that Heena enjoyed street food, also began posting photos of chhole bhature, golgappas and kebabs. She was so successful in the deception that it was Heena who messaged her, offering words of comfort. Later, when Mudita introduced her to pornography, Heena accepted it as normal because 'her friend' had shown it to her-a trust that remained unbroken even when Mudita asked Heena to film herself naked. It was only when Heena's mother chanced upon the messages that the dangerous 'friendship' came to light.</p> <p>It was Mudita's Facebook account that gave Manoj Sharma-psychiatrist and founder of NIMHANS's social media de-addiction centre in Bengaluru-a look at how much deliberation predators put into their efforts. ""Of the 8-10 children we see per week, invariably, several have been led to watch porn online,"" says Sharma. ""Typically, they are conditioned to porn from an early age-they find nudity to be no big deal. So it doesn't feel exploitative to them [if they were to be] filmed in the same manner,"" says Sharma. ""Everything is available online and can also easily be hidden. This is a big advantage for predators: they hide behind the cloak of their own profile, and behind what children don't share with their parents.""</p>",4
956453284,South Korea ‘sextortion’ mastermind coerced young women into sharing graphic images,2020-11-25 00:00:00,"<p>Trolling behind the anonymity afforded by an encrypted chat app, the man who called himself “Baksa” pretended he was many things: a no-holds-barred loan shark, a private eye for hire and a fortysomething Korean with a prosthetic leg living outside the law’s reach in Cambodia.</p> <p>In reality he was an out-of-work recent college grad who’d been bedridden for a year after a limb-lengthening surgery to overcome insecurities about his height.</p> <p>From his bedroom, Cho Ju-bin, 25, spun illusions and masterminded one of the most notorious sex crime schemes to shake South Korea in years. He blackmailed dozens of young women into providing sexually compromising images and videos, which he sold to tens of thousands of his users. Authorities say he and his collaborators, including a 16-year-old boy, ran the operation through secretive chatrooms on the app Telegram. They hunted for prey through social media and reaped their profits through the cryptocurrency bitcoin.</p> <p>The case has ignited a fierce debate in South Korea about justice and how to exact punishment for digital sex crimes. The wide-reaching scandal has again exposed an underlying culture of cavalier consumption of material depicting sexual abuse. Among the hundreds being investigated as having joined the chatrooms are police officers and elementary school teachers.</p> <p>“Because of the level of abuse and the number of victims, collaborators and participants, there was a collective shock to our society,” said Lee Hyo-rin, an activist and victim counselor with the support group Korea Cyber Sexual Violence Response Center.</p> <p>The scheme is the latest in a series of headlines that have roiled South Korea in recent years involving illicit sex videos or spy cam recordings that have put the country’s women on edge and raised questions about the dark side of the nation’s much-touted internet and smartphone infrastructure and technological adaptation. In 2019, some of the country’s most popular K-pop stars were investigated and convicted of crimes related to the sharing of illegally recorded sexual material, some involving women who were drugged and raped.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Cho — who also called himself “CEO Park” — was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Thursday. Prosecutors had sought a life term. Others accused of conspiring with him to recruit and threaten the victims, advertise the chatrooms and monetize the profits received sentences ranging from seven to 15 years.</p> <p>South Korean women rally in support of the #MeToo movement to mark International Women’s Day in 2018. (Ahn Young-joon / Associated Press)</p> <p>Police say more than 70 women, many of them minors, were lured into providing personal information under the guise of a potential high-paying liaison with an older man and then blackmailed into providing sexually explicit material to Cho and others who would threaten to tell family and friends or post on social media.</p> <p>Those videos and images were then fed into chatrooms that operated like a multi-level marketing scheme, where members had to post their own pornographic images or pay fees up to $1,300 for access to more exclusive chatrooms. When some of the operators were arrested in late 2019, others stepped up to take their place and new chatrooms cropped up.</p> <p>Cho mimicked chatrooms he’d seen on Telegram. But he styled himself as a ruthless purveyor with access to a cache of more extreme videos to attract paying users, he said in court testimony.</p> <p>“My aim was, how can I be even more extreme, and get more attention?” he testified this week at a co-conspirator’s trial, speaking with the composure of an entrepreneur discussing a start-up venture. He has appalled the country as a man who appears as both an average college student and a criminal who intimidated his victims into torture or self-mutilation and urged his cronies to commit rape. At a previous hearing for his sentencing, he tearfully apologized and said he accepted responsibility for his crimes.</p> <p>One of the victims wrote an anonymous letter to perpetrators published in the newspaper Hankyoreh, recounting how fearful she felt being threatened by invisible abusers blackmailing her from beyond computer and smartphone screens.</p> <p>“When I saw your faces being unmasked one by one, it truly hit me that my life had been destroyed,” she wrote. “Behind your online veil, you seemed like fictional figures. I wished it was all fiction and my reality was a passing dream.”</p> <p>The encrypted messaging app Telegram is displayed on a smartphone in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2017. In South Korea, a ring of young men allegedly used the app to blackmail women for sexually explicit material and distributed them for profit. (Associated Press)</p> <p>Attorneys for the victims argued in court that the young women live with the anxiety that the videos and images they were coerced into creating would be reproduced and live indefinitely on the web.</p> <p>“I hope their punishment is never-ending, the way my pain will never end,” one victim wrote in a letter read out in court by an attorney. “Did they even think there were human beings just like them on the other end of the videos?” wrote another woman, who said she keeps her hair long and wears heavy makeup to shield her face, out of fear that she might get recognized from the images.</p> <p>Outrage over the case, which earlier this year eclipsed the COVID-19 pandemic in news cycles and conversations in South Korea, led to the passage of a law increasing punishments for those who possess or view illegally created sexual material. The law will also hold some websites liable for hosting such content, even though the app Telegram remains out of reach because it is based overseas.</p> <p>Shin Jin-hee, a publicly appointed attorney representing many of the victims, has dealt with similar crimes in recent years but said Cho’s operation was on another level. In addition to charges of distributing child pornography and illegal material, prosecutors have also charged the defendants with running a criminal syndicate, a move Shin said was unprecedented and reflected the magnitude of the case in the public’s eye.</p> <p>“The rapid distribution, the systematic organization was to another degree of severity,” she said. “The technology is developing so fast ... and the policies and institutions can’t keep up.”</p> <p>South Koreans attend a rally in support of the #MeToo movement to mark International Women’s Day in Seoul in 2018. (Associated Press)</p> <p>An attorney for the 16-year-old defendant, who was in high school at the time of his alleged crimes, also blamed technology for leading her young client astray. His name has not been made public.</p> <p>“He was a kid who was good at computers,” the attorney said in final arguments in court. “The fault may be with adults who allowed children to use smartphones and the internet without proper restrictions and created this illegal content.”</p> <p>Lee, the activist and counselor, said that as the digital native generation who grew up with smartphones and high-speed internet comes of age, many of its members are likely exposed to abusive, criminal material at a young age and become inured to it. Some online harassment cases her group was consulted on involved elementary school students, she said.</p> <p>“When it comes to online sex crimes, both the victims and perpetrators are getting younger and younger,” she said. “If you’re well versed in the web platforms, anyone can do it, and there is the solid demand to support it.”</p> <p>She said because South Korea is at the technological forefront, the recent scandals were leading the country to wrestle with the right legal protections and prevention measures for the types of new digital sex crimes other countries will inevitably be dealing with as well.</p> <p>“We know it’s unacceptable in the real world, but those universal standards don’t seem to apply in this online space,” she said. “We need to change that.”</p>",4

According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), security forces may have coordinated with unidentifiable gunmen during an overnight 6 December attack in Baghdad’s al-Khilani Square that left dozens killed and more injured. Witnesses report Iraqi security forces abandoned the area shortly before the attack and returned minutes after it ended, cutting off electricity for at least an hour, immersing demonstrators in darkness during the onslaught.</p> <p>“All we could see was light coming from the bullets,” said one protester describing the 4am attack.</p> <p>Palestine: Generational repression of civil rights</p> <p>A new report from HRW detailed how for more than 50 years, Israel has employed draconian military orders to suppress Palestinian nonviolent activity and decimate their basic civil rights, including freedom of expression and assembly.</p> <p>For instance, the 1967 military order 101 continues to criminalize participation in a gathering of more than ten people without a permit on an issue, which the army considers to be a political gathering punishable of up to ten years. The order also prohibits the publication of political materials or the display of flags or political symbols without army approval. Meanwhile, 2010’s military order 1651 imposes a ten-year sentence on anyone who attempts to – orally or otherwise – influence public opinion in the West Bank in a manner that “may harm public peace or public order” or “publishes words of praise, sympathy or support for a hostile organization, its actions or objectives,” which the army defines as “incitement.” The vaguely worded order also states that “offenses against authorities” can carry a sentence of life imprisonment.</p> <p>The real-life consequences of these orders have been disastrous for civil society and non-violent actions in the West Bank. According to the report, between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2019, a total of 4,590 Palestinians were prosecuted for entering a “closed military zone” – a designation the Israeli army imposes on protest sites in real-time – while 1,704 were prosecuted for “membership and activity in an unlawful association”, and 358 for “incitement.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, in digital rights</p> <p>To mark last month’s 16-days of activism against gender-based violence, the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media (7amleh) launched a campaign addressing the phenomenon of violence, harassment and extortion of Palestinian women online. The campaign saw social media influencers in the West Bank push the conversation online through infographics and multimedia, drawing on 7amleh’s research on the issue, which revealed one-third of young, Palestinian women are subjected to violence or sexual harassment online.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia: a ‘mockery of justice’ for Jamal Khashoggi’s murder</p> <p>It has been over a year since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into a Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul, never to be seen again. Late last month, the official investigation into his death came to a predictable end after the kingdom’s public prosecutor office announced it had sentenced five people to death and handed out jail terms for three others allegedly complicit in his murder, calling the crime “spontaneous” and not premeditated.</p> <p>The Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) condemned the verdicts, noting the trial lacked the minimum standards of a fair trial and due process. The rights organization also called on international bodies to ensure top Saudi officials involved in the killing do not evade justice – a call reiterated by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).</p> <p>“Conducting a sham trial for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and sentencing five people to death shows that the Saudi government under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is committed to an ongoing mockery of justice,” said CPJ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator, Sherif Mansour. “The international community, including the U.S., must not allow Saudi Arabia to keep evading justice in the Khashoggi case.”</p> <p>Dr. Agnès Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, who investigated the killing and published her findings back in June 2019, called the verdict “the antithesis of justice”. Callamard’s UN report highlighted the extensive planning of the murder, and included audio from Turkish authorities in which a team of Saudi agents, while waiting for Khashoggi to arrive at the embassy to pick up necessary papers for his planned nuptials, can be overheard discussing how they would carry the body out of the building.</p> <p>Bottom line: the hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death. The masterminds not only walk free. They have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial. That is the antithesis of Justice. It is a mockery. — Agnes Callamard (@AgnesCallamard) December 23, 2019</p> <p>While Callamard’s report concluded that the killing “was overseen, planned and endorsed by high-level officials,” the recent verdict in Saudi Arabia has provided total immunity for those very officials in the chain of command, while scapegoating those tasked with carrying out the murder.</p> <p>The end-result sends a chilling message to dissidents from the region living in exile: that their safety abroad is far from secure.</p> <p>“This is not just about the justice Jamal deserves, or even closure for his friends and family. This is also about deterrence; so another critic is not killed in London’s Hyde Park, abducted from a Toronto suburb or assaulted in a D.C. bar,” said Egyptian human rights advocate Mohamed Soltan in a Washington Post Op Ed. “When we seek justice and accountability, we are not seeking to avenge Jamal’s murder. We are attempting to secure an immediate future where we can live without constant fear of assassination and dismemberment.”</p> <p>Egypt: “Silence and collusion are not our choices”</p> <p>https://www.facebook.com/gamal.eid.90</p> <p>In Egypt, IFEX member and director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), Gamal Eid was attacked on a street near his Cairo home while waiting for a taxi. Eid was thrown to the ground and beaten by at least a dozen men who were waiting for him in three parked cars. With pistols drawn, the group doused Eid in red paint while warning him to “behave himself”.</p> <p>This is the fourth attack on the prominent activist since October 2019, prompting a call from GCHR on international bodies like the UN to step in and protect Eid. Posting photos of the aftermath on Facebook, Eid said he believes these escalating attacks are orchestrated by security forces in such a manner as to avoid a public scandal like that of Giulio Regeni, the Italian Cambridge University graduate who was kidnapped and brutally tortured to death in Egypt in 2016.</p> <p>Regeni’s death continues to receive attention, with Italian prosecutors naming five senior security officials last year as suspects in the death, and more recently, accusing Egyptian officials of fabricating contradictory stories to deliberately mislead the investigation.</p> <p>“They resorted to attacking me one time after another, to punish me, silence me and stop me from doing human rights work and my frequent criticism of the gruesome human rights violations,” said Eid. “But again, silence and collusion are not our choices.”</p> <p>With Egypt continuing to face an on-going violent crackdown against civil society organizations and human rights defenders, the repeated failure of Egyptian authorities to prevent these attacks and hold the perpetrators accountable is likely indicative of their complicity.</p> <p>“This latest assault on Gamal Eid has the fingerprints of Egyptian security forces all over it,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW. “Repeated attacks against one of Egypt’s leading rights activists raises grave concerns about the possible involvement of Egypt’s leadership.”</p> <p>In Brief</p> <p>Morocco</p> <p>The arrest of journalist Omar Radi sparked outrage after he was summoned to a police station, detained, and put on trial on the same day over a six-month old tweet where Radi criticized a judge’s verdict of imposing sentences on 42 people for participating in the “hirak” protests in northern Morocco’s Rif region. “These shameless officials should be neither forgotten nor forgiven,” wrote Radi in the 5 April tweet, calling the judge an “executioner”.</p> <p>Radi has since been released until his next trial session in March, and could face up to one year in prison under article 263 of Morocco’s criminal code, that punishes anyone “with the intention of damaging their honor, their delicacy or the respect due to their authority, shows contempt to … a magistrate.”</p> <p>In recent weeks, Morocco has also sentenced prominent YouTube vloggers to four years in prison, as well as rapper Gnawi to one year in prison for supposedly criticizing the police, but more likely over his track “Long Live the People” in which he criticized the regime. A high school student subsequently received a three-year sentence for posting lyrics to Gnawi’s viral track on social media.</p> <p>Moroccan rapper Gnawi has been charged with “offending” public officials in an Instagram live. His arrest comes just two days after he released a video indirectly insulting the king of Morocco pic.twitter.com/LfBbk0pa26 — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) November 15, 2019</p> <p>Syria</p> <p>Six years have passed since masked gunmen abducted Syrian human rights defenders, Razan Zaitouneh and her husband Wael Hamada, and their colleagues Samira Al-Khalil and Nazim Hammadi from their offices at the Violations Documentation Center (VDC) in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Last month, rights groups issued a joint statement calling on authorities to release the prominent activists, now known as the Douma Four, who were investigating war crimes committed by Syrian authorities at the time of their kidnapping. While rebel group Jaysh Al-Islam is widely believed to be behind their abduction, they remain among some 98,000 Syrians forcibly disappeared since March 2011 whose fate remains unknown.</p> <p>Meanwhile, digital activists have pushed back on Twitter’s recent announcement that it would be deleting inactive accounts, which would include those of forcibly disappeared activists like Razan Zaitouneh and those killed, such as slain radio host Raed Fares. “Deleting their accounts could deal a significant blow to the Syrian memory as well as deprive us of vital evidence for use in justice and accountability processes,” said Syrian Archive’s co-founder, Hadi Al-Khatib in a recent interview.</p> <p>UAE</p> <p>The security apparatus has targeted dozens of relatives of Emirati dissidents who are either currently detained or living abroad. According to HRW, relatives of eight dissidents have seen their citizenships revoked, have been arbitrarily denied access to services, and have faced restrictions placed on their ability to access jobs and higher education. Relatives have also been subject to state surveillance, threats, and regular questioning by security officials who are empowered by a 2003 federal law granting the security apparatus a wide mandate to curb political activity, by force if necessary.</p> <p>Documenting the region</p> <p>Finally, in its annual global survey, CPJ says the number of imprisoned journalists in the region has risen, with Egypt and Saudi Arabia now ranked as the third worst jailers in the world after China. Meanwhile, although the number of journalists killed has fallen globally, Syria remains the deadliest country, with seven journalists killed in 2019.</p> <p>If you enjoyed this, check out all the December regional roundups!</p> <p>Africa</p> <p>Americas</p> <p>Asia & Pacific</p> <p>Europe</p>",4

The panel had found Magopeni guilty of misconduct, after an episode of a television programme which had been blocked by a court interdict was still aired. “This pattern needs to be condemned because it makes a mockery of labour laws and associated processes.

881792780,Blinkered Malice: Evil In The Films Of Taika Waititi,2019-10-23 00:00:00,"<p>Jojo Rabbit is almost here. Get your tickets now!</p> <p>Taika Waititi’s films take place in worlds where the heightened and the everyday are one and the same. In What We Do in the Shadows, Vampires (as well as werewolves and other varieties of supernatural folk) exist. They’re as likely to quarrel over whose turn it is to do dishes as they are to brawl over one of their number cluelessly alerting an amateur vampire hunter. In Hunt for the Wilderpeople, a would-be-tough teenager and his surly adoptive uncle flee into the New Zealand bush to escape from the government. The development of their relationship is as important to their survival as is evading their increasingly relentless pursuers. In Thor: Ragnarok, the Norse god of thunder’s long-lost sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) returns from exile, vowing to conquer existence. Thor coming to terms with his late father Odin (Anthony Hopkins)’s failings and his own doubts is vital to stopping her – even more than learning to wield his powers to their fullest extent. The worlds Waititi spins and the tales he tells are gloriously zonked and frequently hilarious. Simultaneously they’re insightful, thoughtful studies of humanity. Furthermore, Waititi depicts evil as something intensely dweeby. Waititi’s villains, even Blanchett’s fairly stern Hela, are lost in their own worlds. They’re clueless and more than a bit absurd. It’s funny. And, once the laughter subsides, a fairly astute observation on the nature of wickedness.</p> <p>What We Do in the Shadows’ vampire flatmates are the picture’s protagonists but, lovable though they are, they’re all at least a little bit evil. They kill casually – one memorable argument between Waititi’s Viago and Jemaine Clement’s Vladislav turns on the latter ruining the former’s antique couch by getting blood all over it. Viago is far more upset about his furniture than he is some poor schmuck getting gnawed on. Yes, drinking blood comes with the vampire package, but the disregard with which they treat their victims stands out given that they can and do care about people – charmingly milquetoast software developer Stu (Stu Rutherford) for instance, or Viago’s beloved Katherine (Ethel Robinson). But, when it comes time for a snack someone they don’t care about might as well be a sandwich – ideally a sandwich that no one has had sex with. Beyond their frequent murders, the flatmates can be impressively oblivious to anyone’s needs other than their own. Case in point, Vladislav describes his infamous history as a torturer as a sign that “I was in a bad place.”</p> <p>Hunt for the Wilderpeople’s overzealous child services worker Paula (Rachel House) does not murder people willy-nilly. But her contempt for a boy she’s supposed to be protecting and her obsession with being an action hero reveal her morality to be severely warped all the same. Wilderpeople’s young hero Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) has had a rough go. He’s built up a hard-edged shell to protect himself and done his fair share of acting out. Paula sees Ricky only as “a real bad egg.” She speaks of his assorted misdemeanors as though they were the crimes of a master criminal. And when Ricky takes off into the bush rather than return to the foster system after his adoptive Aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata)’s death, Paula goes to war. She continually escalates her conflict with Ricky until she’s riding an armored personnel carrier and commanding a fleet of police and hunters in pursuit of the boy and his adoptive Uncle Hec (Sam Neill). As Wilderpeople progresses, Paula comes to view her pursuit of Ricky and Hec as a grand battle, one in which she’s the crusading hero:</p> <p>Never mind that Paula’s supposed to be the one advocating for Ricky. Never mind that New Zealand child services are in no way equivalent to the movie version of American police. Never mind that the level of force she ultimately brings to bear in her hunt for Ricky is so disproportionate that it crosses into the realm of the absurd. Paula’s the hero. At best, Ricky is an object to be retrieved. At worst, he’s her villain.</p> <p>Thor: Ragnarok’s two primary villains – Blanchett’s Hela and Jeff Goldblum’s Grandmaster, operate at both macro and micro levels of wickedness. Hela’s grand speeches and plots of universal conquest coexist alongside her pettily abusive behavior to her younger brothers Thor and Loki. The Grandmaster’s thinly painted-on affability and oozing sleaze coexist alongside his breathtaking cruelty and masterminding of a culture that has put him on top of everyone else. While their motivations and personalities are starkly different from one another, both Hela and the Grandmaster display an unsettling, almost childish drive to be the most important person in the world. Grandmaster constantly needs to burnish his own self-image – whether through emphasizing that the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is his gladiatorial champion or trying to claim credit for the revolution that rose up to overthrow him. Hela is less openly needy in her pursuit of power and recognition. But her confrontations with Loki and Thor consistently see her try to belittle and bully them. She conflates their very existence with Odin’s decision to erase her (and Asgard’s time as an actively imperial power) from history – one of many moral failures on his part, but one his sons are in no way responsible for. It is not enough for Hela to overthrow her brothers and return Asgard to its warmongering days. No, she aims to repay her father’s insult by breaking his other children – as if by maiming and mocking Thor she will affirm her own might. It’s telling that, during their climactic battle, Hela aims to humiliate Thor first and kill him second – still trying to make the same point to him she had already made when she shattered Mjolnir.</p> <p>Evil, in Taika Waititi’s films, is both fundamentally ridiculous and fundamentally blinkered. His heroes may be eccentric goofballs themselves, but they possess an awareness of the world and an emotional intelligence that enables them to grow and change. Ricky Baker, Hec, Thor and even What We Do in the Shadows’ evil-but-capable-of-empathy vampires are changed by their experiences. Paula, Grandmaster and Hela remain static – too caught up in their obsessions and foibles to do anything but charge forwards and demand the world change to suit their desires. They pay no mind to other people because other people aren’t a part of their worlds beyond the most superficial level. They’re hilarious. They’re dreadful. They’re malignant dweebs. And, when setting aside the heightened nature of their actions, they’re a sharp study of how pathetic that sort of cruelty and viciousness truly is.</p>",4
1028817656,How Netherlands systematically used extreme violence in Indonesia and hushed this up afterwards,2022-02-17 14:24:14,"<p>Dutch troops, judges and politicians collectively tolerated and hushed up the systematic use of extreme violence during the Indonesian War of Independence. Historians have now shown how this could happen. ‘It was scandal management rather than prevention,’ says Leiden historian and research leader Gert Oostindie.</p> <p>In their publication Over de grens (Over the Border) the 17 authors have presented their main conclusions: Dutch troops used extreme violence such as executions, torture and torching villages more often than was thought. The violence was systematic and went unchecked. The reason: the war against the Republic of Indonesia had to be won and the Netherlands wanted to be in charge of the decolonisation process, say the researchers.</p> <p>Gert Oostindie, Professor of Colonial and Postcolonial History, is the first author of the book. As former director of KITLV/Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, he initiated the programme together with the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (NIOD) and the Netherlands Institute of Military History (NIMH). Various Leiden historians worked on the programme (see below) and a total of 14 books will be published. In an interview, Oostindie explains how they approached the research.</p> <p>Intimidation and violence against Indonesian citizens. NIMH collection.</p> <p>In recent years several studies have been published on this topic. What was missing?</p> <p>‘This decolonisation war was the Netherlands’ biggest 20th-century war. There are libraries full of books about what the Germans did to us, but until recently we could barely fill a bookshelf on this war. This is why we called for a major study in 2012. There were hardly any studies at the time, but more have appeared recently. At the end of the 1960s, there were revelations about extreme violence. In 1969, the government took the stance that there had been excesses, but that the armed forces had behaved correctly as a whole. Thanks in part to the dissertation by Rémy Limpach, who was on this research team, and also because of other studies such as my book ‘Soldaat in Indonesië’ [Soldier in Indonesia, ed.] there were more and more signs that the Dutch armed forces were guilty of systematically using extreme violence, but by no means everything had been properly investigated. We have now reconstructed attitudes to violence in the whole chain: from the armed forces and especially the commanding officers to lawyers and politicians.’</p> <p>‘Some wrote that the violence was unacceptable whereas others wrote that nothing happened or that such violence was unavoidable.’</p> <p>How could the cover-up culture be so persistent?</p> <p>‘There was clear evidence of scandal management, as the study of the dynamics during the war shows. Reports of extreme violence by Dutch soldiers were minimised and covered up. We based our information on archive material such as from the intelligence services and security services and the minutes of the Council of Ministers. And a book is now being published about the post-war trend: people didn’t want to hear it. What played an increasingly important role after the war was that at all levels people wanted to take account of the feelings of the veterans and the Indonesian community in Dutch society.’</p> <p>What else came to light?</p> <p>‘A number of matters had never been properly investigated, such as how and why artillery and bombardments were used. This showed that the armed forces deliberately took risks and took little or no account of civilian casualties. The number of Indonesian dead is often estimated at over 100,000, compared to a few thousand Dutch war dead. This also points to extreme violence. Our research has also given a better impression of the work of the security services and how the military justice system worked. We’ve gained a broader, more in-depth picture and this also adds more nuance to the story. For instance, that there was a lot of fighting in certain parts of the archipelago, but not in others.’</p> <p>Was a lot of new source material studied?</p> <p>‘Yes, this involved on the one hand more thorough research of known Dutch government archives and on the other a lot of new archive material, such as documents from the Dutch secret service, who confiscated texts and photos, for instance, when they arrested Indonesians. These documents say more about the Indonesian side of the story. They ended up in the National Archive and some are also in the KITLV collections at the University Library in Leiden. We also show this in the online exhibition Images of the Indonesian War of Independence at the University Library.</p> <p>The Dutch intelligence service at work.</p> <p>‘The publicity surrounding this research has meant that new sources from private individuals have also surfaced, such as grandad’s letters or diaries from the attic. These kinds of personal stories are an important addition to the official sources, which are incomplete because little was allowed to be reported. They show how diverse people’s views were: some reflect frankly on the violence and write how they thought it was unacceptable. Others write that nothing happened or that such violence is unavoidable in a war.’</p> <p>When did the political tide start to turn?</p> <p>‘An important political turning point was in 2005, sixty years after Soekarno declared Indonesian independence, when Minister of Foreign Affairs Ben Bot said in Jakarta: we were on the wrong side of history. We shouldn’t have waged that war. But at the time nothing was said about how that war was waged. We wanted to research this further and the government earmarked over four million euros for this in 2017, as co-funding but not commissioning party.’</p> <p>A few years ago the Indonesian government wasn’t keen on this research taking place.</p> <p>‘The government did indeed indicate that didn’t think it necessary because they wanted to look ahead. For Indonesia, it was clear: you had no right to occupy us and we kicked you out during the war. But this research is first and foremost about finding the truth about Dutch history. To face up to the fact that we as a nation have a rosy self-image that is often at odds with how the Netherlands behaved. Incidentally, there is a difference between the position of the Indonesian government and the interest in society there and among historians. They are also looking for nuance in the official story, which was rather monolithic, when there was just as much division in society there in 1945-1949.’</p> <p>How was the collaboration with Indonesian historians?</p> <p>‘They provided new insights, in the use of terminology alone. The research programme is now called Onafhankelijkheid, Dekolonisatie, Geweld en Oorlog (Independence, Decolonisation, Violence and War). The term independence wasn’t included initially. That’s not surprising because in an international academic work the term “decolonisation war” is customary and we used it very deliberately in response to the framing as police action. But Indonesian historians asked: why does the title begin with decolonisation? We were already decolonised on 17 August 1945 because that was when we became independent.’</p> <p>‘For Indonesia, it was clear: you had no right to occupy us and we kicked you out during the war.’</p> <p>King Willem Alexander apologised in 2020 for the Dutch actions in Indonesia. What will Prime Minister Rutte do now?</p> <p>‘It’s crystal clear that the government position from 1969 is incompatible with what we know now. So I think it’s obvious that he’ll say something, but what that is I don’t know. That really is a political matter.’</p> <p>You recently retired. How has the discussion about the colonial past changed in recent decades?</p> <p>‘There’s a much more critical view of the colonial past, also in countries like France and England. I started out researching Latin America and the Caribbean. There, but here too, there was no doubt that the colonial period was incredibly violent and racist – take the decimation of the indigenous population and the introduction of African slavery, for example. But people in the Netherlands looked at Indonesia in a different, more nostalgic way and it was harder to come to terms with this violent past. It’s good that we’ve reached that point and people will hopefully see the power of this research. But we’re not there yet. Much more Dutch than Indonesian material has been studied and ideally Dutch and Indonesian historians will continue this together. Most insights come about when researchers look at the same sources from different perspectives.’</p> <p>Several historians from Leiden worked on this national research programme, from the KITLV and the University, such as NIMH director Ben Schoenmaker, a professor by special appointment in Leiden. Bart Luttikhuis and Thijs Brocades-Zaalberg compared other decolonisation wars in the period 1945-1962 with the Dutch one, Esther Swinkels is doing PhD research in Leiden and many Leiden students contributed over the years, for instance analysing soldiers’ letters and diaries.</p> <p>Text: Linda van Putten</p> <p>Photo above article: Netherlands Institute for Military History collection</p>",4

1024486541,10 Notorious Dictators Who Wrote Literary Works,2022-01-22 00:00:00,"<p>WhatsApp Pin Share Email 3 Shares</p> <p>The men on this list were cruel dictators. At their orders, if not by their own hands, thousands or, in some cases, even millions, of victims were killed, often after being tortured. These dictators’ names are deservedly infamous. So vicious and villainous were they that it is almost impossible to believe that any of them would care to read, let alone to write, novels or poetry, but all 10 of the notorious dictators on this list did just that.</p> <p>While the literary quality of some of their works has been acclaimed, some of their writings have been dismissed as “unsuccessful.” One dictator’s novel was even carefully scrutinized by a U.S. government translator, U.S. officials, and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Whatever one makes of the efforts of these poets and novelists, it seems clear that the grimness of their rule as despised dictators will forever overshadow their literary works.</p> <p>Related: 10 Good Things Done By Evil Dictators</p> <p>10 Julius Caesar</p> <p>Julius Caesar’s Commentaries on the Gallic War – Book 1</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>Today, Julius Caesar (100 BC–4 BC) is generally regarded as a Roman emperor, mostly, perhaps, because it is forgotten that he himself claimed the title of dictator a year before he was assassinated. Politically savvy Caesar used his military triumphs as a general and his political alliances to advance his career, serving first as the governor of Spain—at the time, a province of Rome—and then as the governor of Gaul, the region of Europe that today includes France and Belgium. As the governor of Gaul, he enriched himself, using his wealth to support his army when he crossed the Rubicon River, initiating a civil war with the Roman general Pompey, whom Caesar defeated. Caesar’s triumph was followed by his proclamation that he was now the dictator of Rome.</p> <p>Caesar was also a man of letters whose oratorical mastery led the famous teacher and rhetorician Quintilian to hold him in high regard. As The Conquest of Gaul points out, Caesar’s “elegance of language” put him nearly on par with Rome’s greatest orator, Cicero. Caesar’s Commentaries on the Gallic War and the Civil War, although non-fiction, are described as “so elegantly and lucidly written that they compel…admiration even without the addition of further ornament.”</p> <p>Gifted both in public speaking and writing, Caesar brought his immense writing talent to bear on poetry as well, writing The Journey, allegedly while traveling to Spain. Unfortunately, only half a dozen lines of the poem—a bit of literary criticism—have survived, hexameters expressing Caesar’s disappointment in the playwright Terence’s “lack of ‘comic force’…but [praising the dramatist]…as a lover of ‘pure speech.’”[1]</p> <p>9 Giuseppe Garibaldi</p> <p>Giuseppe Garibaldi: One of the Greatest Generals of Modern Times</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>The Warfare History Network’s biographical sketch of Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882) captures the spirit of the man and the struggle he waged to reunite his beloved Italy: “Determined to end the divisions within his nation, [the] Italian soldier of fortune [who had become the dictator of Sicily]…landed in Sicily in May 1860 at the head of 1,000 revolutionaries, the Redshirts. The unification of Italy had begun.”</p> <p>After intense fighting and the losses of thousands of soldiers culminated in victory at the Battle of Volturno River in south-central Italy, King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, arriving with the main forces of the Piedmont Army, ordered Garibaldi and his troops to stand down. The king’s men, not Garibaldi’s, would capture the city of Capua. Garibaldi obeyed the king’s decree, surrendered his dictatorial powers, and returned to Caprera, slighted and humiliated by the king, who arrived with his army just in time to end the war that Garibaldi and his loyal men had waged for months.</p> <p>As Jesse White Mario observes in his 1889 supplement to the autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the dictator wrote several novels, including Clelia, Il Volontario (The Volunteer), and I Mille (The Thousand), hoping to earn enough money from their sales to support himself and his family. But the books were “failures from a literary or even a historical point of view.” Indeed, Garibaldi himself replied to critics of his efforts that he himself was aware as much as anyone else of how worthless they were.</p> <p>Citing the hostility of Garibaldi’s critics, Lucy Riall, author of Garibaldi: Invention of a Hero, agrees that the dictator’s novels were not especially successful, noting that only Clelia “was published widely in translation.” He struggled to find an Italian publisher for I Mille; his fourth novel, Manlio, was not published until 1982, long after the author’s death.[2]</p> <p>8 Ludwik Mieroslawski</p> <p>January uprising of 1863 an armed struggle that shaped several generations of Poles (4)</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>According to Ohio University, Ludwik Mieroslawski (1814–1878) was twice a failure. Described as a “Polish general, revolutionary activist, commander of revolutionary movements, and political writer,” he left Poland for France after participating in the November Uprising of 1830–1831. There, his attempt to organize a Young France failed. He next tried his hand at writing, publishing “several poems, historical dramas, and a novel,” but these literary efforts proved unsuccessful.</p> <p>Returning to both Poland and politics, he supported a revolution in his homeland but was arrested by Prussian authorities, tried, and sentenced to death. He was released, however, when the Berlin revolution began. An additional arrest and release occurred, as did more failures to win against his military adversaries. Mieroslawski finally became a dictator during the 1863 January Uprising in Poland. He left Europe to go abroad, reestablishing the Polish Democratic Society and serving as its president until his “dictatorial” ways and the scandals he evoked led to his removal from office. Also, he was later ousted from the organization altogether. He died in “poverty and isolation.”</p> <p>George J. Lerski’s Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945, is kinder in its assessment of Mieroslawski’s literary work than his critics’ appraisals. The dictator’s 1822 debut collection of poems, Ballads and Romances, “constituted a literary breakthrough [opening] the era of Romanticism in Poland,” Lerski says, adding that Mieroslawski’s literary interests encompassed a variety of themes and genres. These included, among others, “Forefathers’ Eve” (Dziady), “a drama in verse” based on Lithuanian folklore; his mystical Books of the Polish Nation and of the Polish Pilgrims, which constitutes “a moral interpretation of the Polish history written in biblical prose”; and his supreme accomplishment, Master Thaddeus (Pan Tadeusz), a sentimental “novel in verse” completed in mid-1834.[3]</p> <p>7 Emperor Meiji</p> <p>History Summarized: The Meiji Restoration</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>Emperor Meiji (1814–1878) became the King of Japan at age sixteen. Through astute political, diplomatic, and cultural actions, he ushered in “the most glorious and prosperous period of Japan’s history” to date. A child prodigy when it came to poetry, he penned his first verse at age eight. Over his lifetime, he wrote between 90,000 and 100,000 thirty-one-syllable waka poems, which alternate lines of five and seven morae (short syllables) and contain a final line of seven morae known as the poem’s tanka.</p> <p>The topics of the emperor’s poems are often conveyed by their titles; many celebrate nature. “Pine” reads, “In a world of storms/ Let there be no wavering/ Of our human hearts;/ Remain as the pine tree/ With root sunk deep in ston[e].” “Universal Brotherhood” ends with a question: “It is our hope/ That all the world’s oceans/ Be joined in peace,/ So why do the winds and waves/ Now rise up in angry rage?”[4]</p> <p>6 Joseph Stalin</p> <p>The Private Life of Joseph Stalin (full documentary)</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>The name of Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) is not one that many would associate with the writing of poetry. Still, the Russian dictator was a poet during his days as a student at the Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis, Georgia. For a time, he even aspired to become a professional poet. Then, as Robert Service recounts in Stalin: A Biography, after becoming “alienated from the authorities,” he seemed to lose interest in poetry, as he had in his academic studies. He chose not to join the Georgian cultural elite, preferring, instead, to pursue “his studies of socialism, politics, and economics.” His participation in the Tbilisi literary scene in 1895-6 was fleeting, and he no longer contributed his works, despite his “pleasing style.”</p> <p>His interest in poetry is all the more surprising, considering how he treated a celebrated Russian poet after coming to power. Unable to stomach the abuses of Stalinist oppression, Osip Emilievich Mandelstam penned but did not publish “a derogatory poem about Stalin in 1933.” It quickly spread through “word of mouth,” writes Helen Rappaport in Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion. A couple of lines made it clear how the poet felt about the dictator: Stalin, “the Kremlin’s mountaineer,” hammered out laws that were “flung/ Like horseshoes at the head, the eye, or the groin.”</p> <p>When Stalin learned of the unflattering poem, he had Mandelstam arrested; soon, the poet was exiled for three years. He was fortunate, Rappaport suggests: Stalin had not ordered him executed, perhaps because the dictator suspected that having the poet shot might be seen as “an act of petulant retaliation for a mere poem.” Although Mandelstam later wrote an ode in praise of Stalin, “perhaps not so much to save himself as to protect his wife,” it seems that the poet had not learned his lesson, as he was arrested again after his exile ended. He returned to Moscow, where he commenced his anti-Soviet activities again. This time, he was sentenced to “one of the harshest camps of the Gulag,” where, in poor mental and physical health, he died within two months of his arrival.[5]</p> <p>5 Benito Mussolini</p> <p>Mussolini – Father of Fascism Documentary</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>An ally of Adolph Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (1883–1945) is most remembered as Italy’s feared and hated fascist leader during World War II. The stony-faced, square-jawed tyrant, whose features, in some official portraits, seem carved of concrete, looks cold and unfeeling. At the time of his death by firing squad, Mussolini was so detested, even by his fellow Italians, that, after his execution, his body was hung upside down on a hook, alongside that of his slain mistress Clara Petacci. While El Duce (The Leader) hung by his heels, his remains were spat upon as the dictator was cursed, and an armed woman stepped forward from the crowd, firing five bullets into Mussolini’s corpse, announcing that her deed was an act of vengeance “for my five dead sons.” The New York Times expressed the judgment shared by millions throughout the world: the dictator’s death was “a fitting end to a wretched life.”</p> <p>It is surprising, if not incredible, that a man such as Mussolini wrote a novel, an act usually considered to require not only some literary talent but also a measure of humanity and sensitivity. Of course, his 1910 Claudia Particella, l’amante del Cardinale (The Cardinal’s Mistress), was a far cry from most fictional narratives. As Mussolini 1883–1915: Triumph and Transformation of a Revolutionary Socialist, edited by Spencer M. Di Scalia and Emilito Gentile, observes, the dictator’s volume was, by its author’s own admission, a nasty book that he judged to be “fit for seamstresses and scandal.” Serialized before its publication in book form, the novel tells the story of two lovers in a “story of violence and shameful acts.” Described as written in the “style of [Alexander] Dumas,” it was a huge success, not only in Italy but also throughout much of the world, “being translated into at least ten languages.”</p> <p>Although Mussolini served as Italy’s prime minister from 1922–1943 and would not become El Duce until 1943, it may have been that, when he wrote his novel, he had not yet fully developed into the hated monster he would become as his nation’s dictator. Perhaps he yet retained at least a modicum of the humanity and sensitivity needed to write a tawdry novel that would beguile people by delivering scandal, despite the growing inhumanity and brutality of the fascist wartime dictator.[6]</p> <p>4 Francisco Franco</p> <p>Franco – Spain’s Nationalist Dictator Documentary</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>Jaime de Andrade’s 1942 novel Raz (Spirit of a Race) glorified “the principles of the Franco regime,” writes Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow in their La Historia del Español (The History of Spanish). At the same time, the book depicted its opponents as losers. Despite the heavy-handed censorship of literary works in Franco’s Spain, the book encountered no obstacles to its publication and easily obtained funds for a film adaptation. However, this turn of events is not as surprising as it might seem: Jaime de Andrade was the pen name of brutal Spanish dictator Francisco Franco (1892–1975), the true author of Raz.</p> <p>As Paul Preston points out in The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, as of 2012, “General Franco and his regime [continued] to enjoy a relatively good press [due to]…persistent myths about the benefits of his rule.” In reality, the author declares, both as a general and as Spain’s dictator, Franco was a cruel leader who, in his war diary of 1922, lovingly described “Moroccan villages destroyed and defenders decapitated.” Extreme violence was used repeatedly to suppress free thought, freedom of speech, and armed resistance before, during, and long after the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).</p> <p>According to Preston, Franco’s tactics included carrying bloody heads as trophies, fixing decapitated heads to bayonets, leaving a “Column of Death” from Seville to Madrid, implementing mass murder, using kangaroo courts; and conducting “cleansing and punishment operations.” Although deaths were often unregistered, it is estimated that Franco’s campaign of terror resulted in between 130,199 and 150,000 fatalities. This was the true state of affairs in Franco’s Spain, a truth never mentioned in the dictator’s novel.[7]</p> <p>3 Mao Zedong</p> <p>Mao Zedong in 10 MINUTES</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>Chinese dictator Mao Zedong (1883–1976) did not write novels. He wrote poetry. In most of his poems, the verses feature images from the natural world or allusions to autobiographical and historical events, which are often military in nature. “Yellow Crane Tower” (1927) exemplifies the general technique of Zedong’s poems. According to Jeremy Ingalls’s Dragon in Ambush: The Art of War in the Poems of Mao Zedong, Zedong’s poem employs “wordplay associated with the theme of imperial rule.”</p> <p>The poem reads, “Through far and wide the nine streams branch across the Middle Kingdom,/ Far deeper now one track that runs from south to north is threading./ But under gray-green murk of rain-damp grime,/ Tortoise and Snake still trap the major stream./ The Yellow Crane perhaps still knows the route?/ Here still survives a traveler’s resting site./ The wine I seize to pledge the torrent’s roaring,/ In my heart’s tide that mounts, its own waves soaring.”</p> <p>According to Dragon in Ambush’s interpretation of Zedong’s poem, the nine streams created by the emperor Yu are contrasted with the even deeper track to the north that Zedong intends to cut as he and his army travel toward the Yangtze River, “the major stream” that must be “crossed” so that his forces can gain control of China.</p> <p>The question that the speaker of the poem (Zedong himself) asks about the Yellow Crane expresses his confidence that he will not only cross the river and conquer China but that he shall also enjoy immortality as a conquering godlike figure, thanks to “the leverage provided by the crane, the supernatural bird commemorated at the site of the Yellow Crane Tower.” To many, this vision may seem odd. Still, it accords with Zedong’s own world view that the successful “dominant world-commander…who [can]…manipulate the…processes of nature and human nature” achieves an apotheosis of sorts, becoming “himself the ‘Heaven’ to which all human beings…are regarded as inevitable subjects.”[8]</p> <p>2 Mohammad Raza Pahlavi</p> <p>Last Persian Shah – Full Movie</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>Mohammad Raza Pahlavi (1919-1980) was the Shah of Iran from 1941 to 1979, when the monarchy was abolished, and Ayatollah Khomeini (1900-1989) became the supreme leader for the next decade. As Abbas Milani points out in The Shah, his biography of Pahlavi, the future head of state was introduced to poetry by his constant companion, Ernest Perron, whom Pahlavi met as a student at Institut Le Rosey, a Swiss boarding school. Although Pahlavi never published any poetry, author Jon Ingvar Kjaran states that the young shah wrote some verses of his own while visiting with Perron, with whom Pahlavi also discussed poetry.</p> <p>As an article in The Guardian points out, despite Pahlavi’s early fondness for poetry, the future Shah of Iran became a dictator who ran a brutally repressive regime, “enforced by the notorious Savak secret police.” His brutality and the corruption of his autocratic rule did not sit well with the Iranian people. When Pahlavi came into political conflict with his nation’s prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq, and “was forced to flee the country,” Pahlavi relocated several times, moving to Mexico, the United States, Panama, and Egypt, where he died in July 1980.[9]</p> <p>1 Saddam Hussein</p> <p>CIA Interrogator: At Time of U.S. Invasion, Saddam Hussein Was Focused on Writing Novel, Not WMDs</p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube</p> <p>As the president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein (1937–2006) was a brutal dictator. His cruelty is evident in the sites of mass graves across the country that he ruled with an iron fist. The Iraqi people themselves testified to the atrocities to which their relatives were subjected. According to The White House website, Iraqi citizens were beaten, tortured, executed by dynamite, gassed, raped, shocked, attacked by dogs and lions, and subjected to medical experiments. In one case, an infant’s eye was gouged out before her skull was crushed by her being thrown against a wall. At Hussein’s son Uday’s direction, Olympic athletes were humiliated by being “smeared with feces and jailed or placed inside [sarcophagi] with nails pointed inward so they would be punctured and suffocated.”</p> <p>The same barbaric dictator wrote both poetry and four novels, including Zabibah and the King, an allegorical love story. In fact, a U.S. government translator not only read but also studied Hussein’s book. As a result, the CIA concluded that, although Hussein himself probably didn’t actually pen the novel’s words, he had “carefully supervised its production and suffused it with his own words and ideas.” The U.S. government’s summary of the novel states that “Saddam’s style, sentence structure, and expressions are clearly present in the novel.” In other words, it seems that, although Zabibah and the King was largely ghost-written, it contains a good deal of Hussein’s own personal input. Writing for The New York Times, Elaine Sciolino states that, amid the volume’s “rambling, overheated prose,” U.S. officials found “an intriguing window into Mr. Hussein’s thinking.”</p> <p>Set in the ancient world, the narrative is a love story featuring a powerful king (a stand-in for Hussein himself) and Zabibah, a beautiful villager who represents the people of Iraq. The king tells his beloved that he is a great leader who must be both obeyed and loved. In the process of the lengthy exchanges of dialogue between the lovers, the king shares his views on “God, politics, love, family, loyalty, betrayal and the will of the people” as well as his own “insecurities.”</p> <p>The otherwise tender romance also includes a scene in which Zabibah is raped, “an obvious reference to the United States invasion of Iraq at the end of the Persian Gulf war,” Sciolino remarks, although U.S. officials interpreted the scene as Hussein’s take on what he saw as “Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.” The novel ends with the deaths of both Zabibah and the king on January 17th, the same day that the United States-led coalition began bombing Baghdad as part of the war to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. The lovers’ bodies are buried side by side “so that the people can throw stones on his grave to desecrate it on the anniversary of his death.”</p> <p>In addition to Zabibah and the King, Hussein wrote The Fortified Castle (2001), Men and the City (2002), and Bygone Demons (2006).[10]</p> <p>fact checked by Darci Heikkinen</p>",4

They were asked about voter lists as well. It seems the reason they took other senior people is to discuss issues with ballot papers.”</p> <p>They added: “All election commission officials are in big trouble. The military is the one who made the fraud accusations, seized power, and is now doing investigations to confirm their claims.”</p> <p>“So even if all UEC staff cooperate fully in the investigation process, the result and decision will be set by the military – so the UEC cannot protect our democratic integrity and the truth,” they said.</p> <p>“And we can’t protest or tell the people what’s going on because we’d be charged, too.”</p> <p>The Guardian has verified the identity of the senior UEC official and their position within the organisation.</p> <p>A number of apparent arrests of UEC officials have been captured in livestream videos over the past two days, accompanied by calls from family members for their relatives to be released.</p> <p>A family member of a detained UEC officer, who asked not to be named for safety reasons, said his relative had been treated well in detention and “not suffered any force yet”. But he was concerned his relative might be endangered if they did not comply with the military investigation.</p> <p>The presence of so many livestreamed arrests was no coincidence, he added. As news of the detentions spread, many UEC officers and their families coordinated plans to document and publicise new arrests.</p> <p>“We citizens made a plan,” he said. “If there’s … someone in front of the house despite curfew, you automatically know what’s their business.”</p> <p>Concerns about the detentions are featuring in the nationwide protest movement that has emerged since the coup, with some on Thursday carrying signs calling for a stop to “kidnappings”.</p> <p>A woman in Matupi township in Chin state posted on Facebook on Wednesday night that “military officers from a nearby base” were calling to interrogate her husband, who served on the district election subcommission.

Reuters previously confirmed he was Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Iran has called the alleged plot ""baseless.""</p> <p>In a statement on the sanctions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States ""remains aware of ongoing Iranian interest in targeting other American citizens, including current and former U.S. officials.""</p> <p>He gave no further details.</p> <p>""The Iranian government's kidnapping plot is another example of its continued attempt to silence critical voices, wherever they may be,"" said Andrea Gacki, head of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""Targeting dissidents abroad demonstrates that the government's repression extends far beyond Iran's borders.""</p> <p>The sanctions block all property of the four Iranians in the United States or in U.S. control, and prohibits any transactions between them and U.S. citizens. Other non-Americans who conduct certain transactions with the four could also be subjected to U.S. sanctions, the department added.</p> <p>Those sanctioned include senior Iran-based intelligence official Alireza Shahvaroghi Farahani as well as Iranian intelligence operatives Mahmoud Khazein, Kiya Sadeghi and Omid Noori, Treasury said.</p>",4
910699632,New kidnapping arrests as senators asking what benefits POGOs bring,2020-03-06 00:00:00,"<p>On March 5, Cebu police announced that they had arrested two Chinese nationals working at a Philippines Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) on suspicion of kidnapping three fellow Chinese nationals.</p> <p>The two were arrested in a house in the Techwood Subdivision, Lapu Lapu City’s Soong Village. During the arrest, the three victims were rescued.</p> <p>Sadly, this isn’t the first time the POGO industry has been caught up in kidnapping stories. In January, five Chinese nationals were arrested for kidnapping a female POGO worker of Taiwanese descent. In the same month, two Vietnamese women were rescued after being abducted by Chinese nationals in Las Pinas City.</p> <p>Increasingly violent crime, even if unrelated to POGO operations themselves, is becoming a common topic in the news. On February 27, a POGO worker was murdered, shot dead and his companion wounded during an apparent money exchange deal gone awry. When police arrested the suspects involved in the incident, they discovered that the two were holding fake IDs.</p> <p>Although POGOs contribute to the local economy, some legislators are now asking whether the taxes earned are sufficient enough reason to overlook the stories coming out about the industry.</p> <p>Senators Richard Gordon and Franklin Drilon questioned members of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) about the benefits of POGO operations. They pointed out that POGOs generate a total net inflow of P7 billion ($140 million) but this revenue translates to a “negligible” 0.04% of the Philippines’ total domestic economy.</p> <p>Drilon was outraged when Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) regulators, the agency responsible for supervising the POGO, claimed that offshore gambling was still beneficial to the country.</p> <p>“I am disappointed at the statement of PAGCOR saying [they] are in favor of POGO continuing in our shores because of the income we earn — such a short-ranged statement,” Sen. Drilon explained during a heated point in the hearing where he called the mentality of PAGCOR representatives “stupid.”</p> <p>“The social problems they have brought in our country are not worth the regulation fees that you earn,” he added. “Why are we so in love with POGOs?”</p> <p>Several senators, including Joel Villanueva and Risa Hontiveros, have demanded a more thorough investigation of the POGO operations, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has suggested he’d be willing to shut down the operations altogether if the industry’s problems continue. However, he’d prefer to consider it on a business by business basis and not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>",4
1025199421,They Were Convicted Of Murder. Now The Men Who Killed Ahmaud Arbery Face Hate Crime Charges.,2022-01-26 20:23:11,"<p>In November, Ahmaud Arbery’s family saw a glimpse of justice. Three men — Travis and Gregory McMichael, a father and son, and William Bryan — were all convicted for murdering the 25-year-old man in February 2020.</p> <p>But their quest is not over. The McMichaels and Bryan will face a hate crime trial in federal court on Feb. 7, when jury selection begins. The Department of Justice filed the charges last February, saying the McMichaels, who are white, targeted Arbery, a Black man, “because of his race and color.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>They face possible life sentences. The McMichaels already received life sentences without the possibility of parole for the murder, while Bryan was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.</p> <p>“This case is a litmus test as to where our judicial system is,” Lee Merritt, the attorney for Arbery’s family, told HuffPost. “We will have a chance to see the grisly facts and images the nation has become intimately familiar with, reconciled with the hate and ideology that motivated those actions.”</p> <p>The trial will be a stark difference from the state trial, where prosecutors hinted at a racial motive but never presented evidence to that effect — even though some was available, including the alleged use of racial slurs during the murder. While Glynn County prosecutors stuck strictly to the mechanical facts of whether the three men unjustly took a life, federal prosecutors will seek a more profound judgment: one that says crimes motivated by prejudice should be considered a crime against the whole country.</p> <p>Arbery’s death — and the subsequent long delay before charges were filed — did spark a wide conversation about how cheap Black life can be in America. “There is something so simple and tragic about a young man not even being able to run and jog in public in America,” Brian Levin, a hate crime expert and attorney, said. “It is not only the tragedy and the loss of Arbery, it was mounting to the beginnings of a lynch mob.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>A Different Legal Standard</p> <p>In Glynn County, the prosecution focused heavily on the legal standard of murder and Travis McMichael’s claim that he was simply executing a citizen’s arrest.</p> <p>Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, at times, made arguments that contained a slight — but never explicit — nod to racial animus on the part of the McMichaels and Bryan.</p> <p>“We are here because of assumptions and driveway decisions. All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions. Not on facts, not on evidence. On assumptions,” she said during opening statements.</p> <p>But the prosecution never introduced evidence, for example, that Bryan told law enforcement officials that Travis McMichael shouted out a racial slur toward Arbery after gunning him down, uttering, “f***ing n****r” after the shooting over Arbery’s body. Defense lawyers asked prosecutors not to ask about it in court because Bryan was the only witness of the alleged incident.</p> <p>The judge presiding over the case heard arguments from lawyers on Friday about racist text messages and whether they should be admitted as evidence. The content of the messages is not clear, but Bryan’s lawyer concedes they are “highly inflammatory.” He argued that disclosing the texts in court would unfairly sway Black jurors.</p> <p>Demonstrators march near the Glynn County Courthouse after the adjournment of daily court proceedings in the trial for the killers of Ahmaud Arbery on Nov. 18, 2021, in Brunswick, Georgia. Sean Rayford via Getty Images</p> <p>In May 2020, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requested a federal probe from the U.S. Department of Justice into Arbery’s death.</p> <p>In the federal indictment, the McMichaels and Bryan are all charged with attempting to “forcibly hold and detain Arbery against his will,” which resulted in the young Black man’s death. The three, also charged with kidnapping, are alleged to have restricted Arbery of his “free movement” and “corral and detain him against his will, and prevent his escape.”</p> <p>The hate crime charges focus on the motivations of the three men when they were chasing Arbery in broad daylight.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The day Arbery was murdered was not the first time he was being chased, Merritt said. It was a reoccurring “hunt” that resulted in the death of a young Black man. This was evident in the murder trial, as the McMichaels made 911 calls about a Black male walking in and out of a construction site months before Arbery was murdered.</p> <p>The legal system in Georgia will also face scrutiny. Merritt said the jury on the federal trial will hear “revealing things” about what Waycross Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill “felt about Black people.” Barnhill recused himself from Arbery’s case, but not before he wrote a letter to Glynn County police arguing that the three men shouldn’t be arrested. He argued that the McMichaels were lawfully following a burglary suspect “with solid first hand probable cause.”</p> <p>Barnhill was the second prosecutor to touch the case of Arbery’s murder after former Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson recused herself from the case because she knew Gregory McMichael.</p> <p>“We already had the criminality of their actions adjudicated before the court of law. The federal charges are going after the terroristic aspect of their actions and the implications they had for Black people of this country,” Merritt said.</p> <p>“What is on trial now is not their behavior, but their reasoning for the behavior. This is an issue that has not been taken up yet, it is an issue of first impression.”</p> <p>Shifting Laws Around Hate Crimes</p> <p>Before Arbery’s murder, Georgia was one of four states without hate crime laws on the books. But that eventually changed.</p> <p>Georgia enacted a hate crime statute in June 2020, months after Arbery’s death, and later repealed its citizen’s arrest statute. The legislation imposes penalties for crimes that are motivated by a person’s race, religion, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender or disability — but the McMichaels and Bryan could not be charged under it, since the law was not in place at the time of Arbery’s murder.</p> <p>Forty-seven states now have hate crime statutes on the books. But bias motivations in hate crime statutes vary statewide. South Carolina, Wyoming and Arkansas are the only remaining states without hate crime laws.</p> <p>There are five federal hate crime statutes that federal prosecutors use when determining if a person should be charged with a hate crime.</p> <p>“There is a bigger picture here, which is the history of this country with Black people being killed for racist motives.” - Heidi Beirich, chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism</p> <p>The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which was introduced under the administration of former President Barack Obama, makes it a crime for someone to be injured or assaulted with a dangerous weapon due to their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected categories.</p> <p>The case of James Byrd Jr. dates back to 1998. Like Arbery, Byrd had been murdered by three white men.</p> <p>Byrd accepted a ride from Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer and John King, all of whom were white supremacists, in Jasper, Texas. Instead of taking Byrd home during the ride, they severely beat him and chained him by his ankles, dragging him with a pickup truck.</p> <p>After Byrd’s lynching, Texas enacted its own hate crime law.</p> <p>Experts view the murder of Byrd and the enactment of the act as a pivotal moment in American history and also something that was long overdue.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“I think it is noteworthy under the Shepard Byrd act, which were two other cases that captured the soul of good America at a time when we are looking at increases of racial violence,” Levin said.</p> <p>Arbery’s family rejected a plea deal in the federal hate crime charges on Jan. 7, even after the men were convicted of murder in Glynn County.</p> <p>His mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the media that the three men need to stand trial again for their brutal actions.</p> <p>A Climate Of Hate</p> <p>Hate crimes against Black people jumped nearly 40% from 2019 to 2020. And 2020, the year Arbery was murdered, saw the most hate crimes in the country since 2001, according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</p> <p>The year Arbery was killed, protests across the country followed the murder of George Floyd by a police officer as well as the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville.</p> <p>During this time, 61% of hate crimes showed people were targeted because of their race, ethnicity or ancestry, according to statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. White people comprised 55% of the perpetrators who committed hateful acts.</p> <p>From 2010 to 2019, hate crime numbers recorded by law enforcement increased by 10%. From 2015 to 2019, nearly half of hate crimes were motivated by anti-Black or anti-African American bias.</p> <p>The Department of Justice says Attorney General Merrick Garland has made confronting hate crimes a “top priority” and said it is rooted in the department’s “foundational history” of combating racial violence and protecting civil rights, according to department spokesperson Areyele Bradford.</p> <p>“Hate crimes impact not only specifically targeted victims, but they also instill fear across communities at large — regardless of whether they gain broader attention nationally,” Bradford said. “Consequently, the prosecution of hate crimes vindicates the rights of not only specifically targeted victims, but of larger communities as well.”</p> <p>Hate crime experts who have studied America’s racist and alt-right-adjacent groups over decades believe the trial will be critical.</p>",4
961859829,"Adventists: Miami-Based Church Leader, Daughter Released After Haiti Kidnapping",2020-12-29 00:00:00,"<p>Seventh-Day Adventist leaders say the Haitian-American director of their church's Inter-American division, and his daughter, were released Monday after being kidnapped in Haiti on Christmas Eve.</p> <p>In a statement posted Monday night on its Inter-America website, Adventist Pastor Leonard Johnson said Pastor Elie Henry and his daughter Irma were free in Port-au-Prince ""and are doing well.""</p> <p>In these uncertain times, you can rely on WLRN to keep you current on local news and information. Your support is what keeps WLRN strong. Please become a member today. Donate now. Thank you.</p> <p>Pastor Henry and his daughter were the latest victims of a ransom kidnapping wave that has paralyzed Haiti this year. According to Adventist statements, they were abducted in Port-au-Prince December 24 as they left an Adventist hospital. Haitian media report their kidnappers demanded a $5 million ransom for their release but the Adventist statement did mention a ransom amount.</p> <p>Pastor Henry was born in Haiti and is based in Miami, where he heads the Inter-American office for the Adventists, a Protestant Christian denomination. Irma Henry is a physical therapist at the Adventist Hospital in Haiti.</p> <p>In a statement over the weekend, Adventist Church administrators had said the release of Henry and his daughter was being negotiated. But Monday's statement did not indicate if a ransom had been paid. (WLRN could not reach Adventist administrators for this report.)</p> <p>The case is just the most recent in a year-long surge of kidnappings the Haitian government now admits has become a national emergency. According to Haitian human rights groups, at least four ransom abductions are reported in the country each day.</p> <p>The crisis hit a flashpoint last month when a Port-au-Prince high school student was kidnapped and killed when her ransom was not paid on time. Her corpse was left in a trash heap at the side of a road.</p> <p>Earlier this month, many medical workers in Port-au-Prince went on strike briefly to protest the government's inability to stem a rising number of kidnappings of doctors and nurses.</p> <p>Critics say authoritarian Haitian President Jovenel Moïse has lost control of the situation — and that Haitian police are often involved with kidnapping gangs. Witnesses say many kidnappers have worn police uniforms while Moïse and Haiti's police deny the charges.</p>",4
973494593,Over 300 Girls Kidnapped In Nigeria’s Zamfara State,2021-03-08 23:00:34,"<p>In the early morning of February 26, 317 girls were kidnapped in the Zamfara state of northwestern Nigeria. The girls were taken by their captors from the Government Girls Secondary School in the town of Jangebe and marched into the forest at gunpoint. The kidnappers had entered Jangebe with an explosion of gunfire, scaring off residents while conducting the abduction and killing a police officer in the process. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, are increasingly using mass kidnappings in attempts to extort ransom and are the expected culprit. A heavily armed search and rescue operation ensued, with both ground and aerial units deployed, and the kidnapped girls have since been released. This event is the latest in a string of kidnappings of schoolchildren in Nigeria.</p> <p>Among others, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres denounced the kidnapping. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari also condemned the action, calling it “inhumane,” according to the BBC. Buhari has gone on record stating that his administration will not give in to blackmail by groups that target innocent school children. Despite his repeated condemnations, however, many have criticized his government’s continued inability to prevent these incidents. Although authorities deny any negotiation with militants, a variety of armed groups have been conducting more and more mass kidnappings for ransom. That the mass abduction of children is seen as a way to secure payment is evidenced by the increased targeting of schoolchildren.</p> <p>The kidnapping in Zamfara state was Nigeria’s second mass abduction of schoolchildren in under two weeks. Nine days prior, 42 people, including 27 students, were kidnapped in Niger state in north-central Nigeria and one student was killed in the process. Only a few months ago, in December 2020, more than 300 schoolboys were kidnapped by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the northern state of Katsina. The boys were rescued by security forces and the 27 recently kidnapped students were released a day after the Zamfara abduction.</p> <p>Overall, security in northern Nigeria has been worsened by the heightened activity of armed groups, including the increased frequency of mass abductions. Kidnappings such as these have become especially common in the region, making families extremely fearful for the safety of their children in schools. Boko Haram has been widely acknowledged to carry out school kidnappings, including the example of the 276 girls abducted from Chibok in 2014, which captured worldwide attention. However, the practice has been increasingly adopted by other militant groups, conveying a worrying trend. According to Al Jazeera, in Zamfara state, abductions for ransom and village raids by gunmen are a regular occurrence.</p> <p>Not only do these attacks risk the lives of children but, even if returned, their quality of life may be forever affected. Kidnappings put children at risk of never returning to school out of fear that school is too dangerous. The three mass abductions since December are a worrying sign for the safety of schoolchildren and for the region’s security, leading to many calls on the state and federal governments to make repressing armed groups and ensuring the safety of children in schools a top priority.</p>",4
1008211644,"Chiwetalu Agu Arrested for Inciting Public, Support for IPOB, Says Nigerian Army",2021-10-08 00:00:00,"<p>The Nigerian army yesterday confirmed the arrest of veteran Nigerian actor, Chiwetala Agu for allegedly inciting the public and soliciting support for the indigenous peoples of Biafra, IPOB, in Onitsha, Anambra state.</p> <p>The Troops of the Nigerian Army arrested the veteran actor who was dressed in the Biafran flag at Upper Iweka Road, Onitsha, in Anambra state earlier.</p> <p>In a statement signed by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, the Nigerian army explained that Agu’s actions negate the peace efforts in the region given the security situation in the state that has degenerated in the past few months leading to wanton killings and kidnappings</p> <p>According to the statement, contrary to reports of brutalisation, the veteran actor was merely taken into custody for further investigation.</p> <p>He said: “Troops of the Nigerian Army (NA) have arrested one Chiwetalu Agu while inciting members of the public and soliciting for support for the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).</p> <p>“Dressed in a very well-known attire of the proscribed group, Chiwetalu Agu was picked up for questioning while inciting members of the public to join the proscribed group. Though he attempted putting up some resistance when troops made effort to take him into custody, he was not assaulted or subjected to brutalisation.”</p> <p>The Nigerian Army, however, acknowledges the rights of individuals of expression but stressed that such rights “must be done within the confines of the law, bearing in mind the imperative for peace, and national security.”</p> <p>“For the avoidance of doubt and emphasis, the IPOB remains proscribed. Therefore, any individual or group seen to be projecting and advancing the cause or activities of the group is viewed as brazenly challenging the constitutionality of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”</p> <p>“More worrisome was the fact that considering the prevailing security situation of the region, coupled with the ongoing Exercise Golden Dawn, his action could be a tacit endorsement and support for the proscribed group. We have all witnessed the activities of the group take a violent dimension in recent times.</p> <p>The Army noted that Agu was not brutalised as reported in sections of the media but was merely taken into custody for further investigation.</p> <p>“Chiwetalu Agu has clearly demonstrated an uncharitable disposition to negate peace and security in the region, hence, he is taken into custody for preliminary investigation. It is important to once again place on record that the allegation that he was brutalized is false and should be disregarded accordingly.</p> <p>“While the NA would not allow IPOB and its sponsors to hold the region captive and allow the security situation to degenerate, it is instructive to restate that national interest supersedes any parochial consideration. Individuals or groups who fan the embers of violence are warned to desist or face the consequences of their actions. The ongoing Exercises are on course and will rid the region of all forms of criminality.</p> <p>“The peace-loving and law-abiding people of the South East are enjoined to please</p> <p>go about their normal activities, as efforts are ongoing to bring perpetrators of violence to book. They are equally urged to continue to support the security agencies to restore normalcy to the region in furtherance of peace.”</p> <p>Share this: Facebook</p> <p>Reddit</p> <p>Twitter</p> <p>Print</p> <p>Pinterest</p> <p>Email</p> <p>WhatsApp</p> <p>Skype</p> <p>LinkedIn</p> <p>Tumblr</p> <p>Pocket</p> <p>Telegram</p>",4
915514418,Shadow Report to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in Response to the 6th Periodic Report of Cameroon,2020-03-30 00:00:00,"<p>Introduction</p> <p>During its 66th Ordinary Session, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR) will consider the 6th Periodic Report of Cameroon pertaining to the implementation of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the Maputo Protocol, and the Kampala Convention. Human Rights Watch welcomes the submission of this state report and in conformity with Rules 74 and 75 of the Rules of Procedure of the ACHPR, Human Rights Watch (Observer Status number 17) submits this shadow report. This report includes findings from Human Rights Watch research into the human rights situation of Cameroon. The report covers violations of the right to life (article 4); the right to equal protection under the law (article 3); arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and other ill treatments (article 5 and 6); and violations of freedom of speech and assembly (article 9, 10 & 11).</p> <p>Background: Crisis in the Anglophone Regions</p> <p>The Anglophone North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon have been embroiled in a deepening human rights and humanitarian crisis since late October 2016, when teachers, lawyers, students, and activists, who had long complained of what they perceive to be marginalization of the two regions by the central government, took to the streets to demand more recognition of their political, social, and cultural rights. Government forces have responded by violently cracking down on peaceful protests, arbitrarily arresting local activists and peaceful protesters, curtailing the activities of civil society, and blocking access to the internet. Armed separatists have also killed, tortured, and kidnapped dozens of civilians, including teachers, students, and government officials.The crisis has led to the displacement of over 679,000 people, deprived more than 600,000 children from schooling in the two Anglophone regions, and claimed more than 3,000 lives.</p> <p>On September 10, amid increasing violence and following sustained international pressure, President Biya called for a “national dialogue,” a series of nationwide discussions aimed at addressing the crisis. The dialogue ended with the adoption of a special status for the two Anglophone regions and the release of hundreds of political prisoners, including Maurice Kamto, leader of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) opposition party, and other persons arrested in connection with the unrest in the North-West and South-West regions.</p> <p>Abuses by armed separatists</p> <p>Armed separatists demanding the secession of the North-West and South-West regions from the Cameroonian state have killed, tortured, and kidnapped hundreds of civilians, including teachers, students, clergy, members and supporters of political parties, and government officials. Human Rights Watch has documented hundreds of cases of kidnapping of civilians by armed separatists. Most of the abductees were released after a ransom was paid.</p> <p>Since early 2017, separatists have consistently targeted school buildings and threatened education officials and students with violence if they did not comply with separatist demands to boycott schools. They have also used schools as bases, deploying fighters and weapons in and near them, including in Koppin village (Mezam division), Tenkha village (Ngoketunjia division), and Mbuluf (Bui division), Bali (Mezam division).</p> <p>In one case, on February 16, a group of armed separatists abducted 170 students, mostly girls under 18, a teacher, and two guards from a boarding school in Kumbo, North-West region. They were all released the following day amid rumors of ransoms being paid..</p> <p>On June 18, separatists kidnapped at least 40 people, including women and children, beat and robbed them in Bafut, North-West region. They were released the following day.</p> <p>On June 28, armed separatists beat and kidnapped John Fru Ndi, a well-known Cameroonian politician, from his home in Bamenda, North-West region. Three days before, armed separatists abducted and released another high-profile figure, Cornelius Fontem Esua, the archbishop of Bamenda.</p> <p>In November, members of the Restoration Forces armed separatist group kidnapped 20 candidates for the February 9, 2020 municipal elections in the town of Jakiri, North-West region. The officials were held in a small house near a separatist camp in Vekovi village. They were released on December 8, after ransom payments believed to range between the amounts of 250,000 and 500,000 CFA ($419-$838) were paid for each abductee.</p> <p>On January 5, 2020, armed separatists from the Restoration Forces group led by a commander known as “General Man Pass Man” kidnapped the mayor of Babessi, North-West region, along with four council members in Babessi. The Restoration Forces released them on January 22, following a ransom payment of 1,000,000 CFA (US$1,678). The separatists had also kidnapped and tortured the Babessi mayor in June 2019.</p> <p>Violations of Freedom of Assembly and Arbitrary Arrest and Detention of Opposition Members and Supporters (Articles 9, 10 &11)</p> <p>Throughout 2019 Cameroonian authorities and security forces arrested hundreds of members and supporters of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) opposition party and violently dispersed peaceful protests.</p> <p>In late January 2019, CRM leader Maurice Kamto was arbitrarily arrested along with over 200 members and supporters of his party, including his closest advisors. Security forces fired teargas into the crowd and rubber bullets from close range to disperse protesters.</p> <p>Kamto and other CRM leaders were unable to meet their lawyers for several days and were later charged before a military court with a number of offenses including hostility against the homeland, threats to public order and rebellion. Those charges appeared to be politically motivated.</p> <p>In June 2019, at least 350 CRM members and supporters were arbitrarily arrested after they attempted to hold demonstrations across the country.</p> <p>Almost all CRM members and supporters, including Kamto, were released on October 5, following a Presidential decree. Sixteen of them, however, including Mamadou Yacouba, CRM Vice President, remain in detention as of February 2020.</p> <p>Issues not addressed in the 6th Periodic Report:</p> <p>Cameroon’s 6th Periodic Report (the Report) does not mention the arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition members or of the violent dispersal of demonstrators by members of the security forces. It also does not describe any measures taken by the Government of Cameroon to mitigate violations of freedom of assembly and public demonstration. The Report states instead that “freedom of assembly and public demonstration is guaranteed by Law No. 90/55.” However, the government of Cameroon failed to uphold those freedoms for opposition members arrested during and following peaceful demonstrations, as documented by Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>The arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds of opposition members and supporters and the subsequent impediment of their access to legal assistance is contrary to Cameroon’s own laws pertaining to freedom of assembly and its obligations as a state party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. It also reflects a climate of rapidly shrinking political and civic space.</p> <p>Suggested questions for the ACHPR to pose to the delegation from the government of Cameroon:</p> <p>Could you please provide a response to allegations of torture documented in an August 2019 report by Human Rights Watch including the incommunicado detention and torture in detention of more than 100 detainees in the State Defense Secretariat (SED) between July 23 -August 4, 2019 in Yaoundé? Has the government initiated any investigations into allegations of abuse and torture in detention by security forces, including the following: The enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention of 26 individuals between January 2018 and January 2019 in the SED detention site The torture of 14 individuals between January 2018 and January 2019 in the SED detention site. The alleged systematic use of torture to extract confessions from detainees in the SED detention site. Has the government initiated any investigations into allegations of abuses by security forces in the context of counter-insurgency operations in the North-West and South-West regions, including: The destruction of property in the North-West and South-West regions between November 2018 and January 2020, including the burning of more than 60 homes in Abuh village in November 2018. Alleged unlawful killings of civilians by security forces in the North-West and South-West regions since November 2018. Have there been any prosecutions, convictions or disciplinary actions taken against officials or security force members involved in the human rights violations described in the August 2019 Human Rights Watch report? If so, could you provide detailed information about the number of cases, the nature of the crimes, the actions taken, and the status of the cases? Has the government taken any concrete measures to mitigate further abuses by security forces? If so, could you please provide any details and documentation of these measures?</p> <p>Recommendations:</p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:</p> <p>Immediately end the practice of arbitrary arrests and detention of civilians, including opposition members and supporters, for exercising their freedom of expression and assembly.</p> <p>Immediately put an end to the use of military courts to try civilians.</p> <p>Ensure that security forces deployed to protests with the purpose of protecting public order are trained to respect human rights during their operations and refrain from using excessive force.</p> <p>Monitor failures to implement domestic laws and policies related to freedom of expression and assembly.</p> <p>Thoroughly investigate all allegations of excessive use of force by members of the security forces during protests, regardless of victims’ political affiliation, and ensure that those implicated in abuses are adequately disciplined.</p> <p>Human Rights Violations by Government Forces</p> <p>Human Rights Watch’s research shows how human rights violations by government forces have been rife since the crisis in the Anglophone regions began in late 2016. Security forces have killed civilians, burned dozens of villages, and arbitrarily arrested and tortured hundreds of alleged armed separatists.</p> <p>Destruction of property (article 14)</p> <p>In one case, security forces burned down more than 60 homes in Abuh village, North-West region, in a three-day security operation carried out in November 2018. Human Rights Watch has confirmed the burning through satellite imagery.</p> <p>On November 22, 2018 gendarmes burned at least 13 houses in Bali village, North-West region.</p> <p>Between December 3 and 6, 2018, following clashes between the military and armed separatists, security forces burned over 55 houses in areas of Kumbo known as SAC Junction and Romajay, as well as in Meluf, Kikaikom, and Nyaro, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning of houses through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses’ accounts.</p> <p>On May 15, 2019, following the killing of two Air Force soldiers by suspected armed separatists, security forces burned over 70 homes in Mankon, Bamenda, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses’ accounts.</p> <p>Between January 17 and 20, 2020, security forces searching for armed separatists burned down over 50 homes in Bali, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses’ accounts.</p> <p>Unlawful killings (articles 4 & 5)</p> <p>On October 21, 2018 soldiers and gendarmes attacked Rom and Nsah villages and unlawfully killed at least four civilians, including a young man with a physical disability.</p> <p>On December 5, 2018 the army unlawfully killed seven people in Meluf village, North-West region, including a 70-year-old man with a hearing impairment who was burned inside his neighbor’s home.</p> <p>On January 18, 2019 soldiers unlawfully killed a 28-year-old nurse who was seven months pregnant, while she was on her way to work in Kumbo, North-West region.</p> <p>On February 6, 2019 soldiers from the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) stormed the market of Bole Bakundu village, South-West region, and unlawfully killed up to 10 men. Community members said they believed that security forces were retaliating against civilians accused of collaborating with the separatists.</p> <p>On April 4, 2019, Cameroonian soldiers, gendarmes, and members of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) carried out a deadly attack on the North-West region village of Meluf. They unlawfully killed five civilian men, including one with a mental disability. Three of the bodies were later found mutilated, including one that had been decapitated.</p> <p>On May 15, 2019, following the killing of two Air Force soldiers by suspected armed separatists, security forces unlawfully killed a 41-year-old man in Alachu, Bamenda, North-West region.</p> <p>On July 10, 2019, soldiers from the Cameroonian Air Force, unlawfully killed a 20-year-old man with a mental disability, and another civilian, during security operations searching for armed separatists in Alachu neighborhood of the city of Bamenda, north-West region.</p> <p>Soldiers, including members of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), and gendarmes unlawfully killed at least 4 civilians, including two men with intellectual disabilities, in a security operation in Bali village between January 17- 20, 2020.</p> <p>Torture and incommunicado detention (articles 3, 5, & 6)</p> <p>The Government of Cameroon publicly declared in 2017 that torture does not take place in Cameroon, however Human Rights Watch continues to receive reports of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment in detention. Cameroon’s Periodic Report fails to demonstrate any progress on investigating the use of torture in detention and does not provide any evidence of cases brought before courts to hold to account security force members implicated in torture or ill-treatment in detention since 2017.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch documented 26 cases of incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance and 14 cases of torture at the State Defense Secretariat (Secretariat d’Etat a la defense, SED) in Yaoundé between January 2018 and January 2019. Between July 23 and August 4, 2019 Cameroonian authorities held more than 100 people in incommunicado detention and tortured many of them in the SED prison in Yaoundé. Former detainees described low- to mid-ranking gendarmes using methods of torture, including severe beatings and near drownings, to humiliate, punish, and extract confessions from detainees, most of whom were civilians detained for suspected ties to armed separatist groups.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch also documented that Cameroonian authorities held over 100 detainees in incommunicado detention and tortured many of them in SED, Yaoundé, from July 23 to August 4, 2019. The detainees were transferred to the facility the morning after inmates in Yaoundé’s Central Prison rioted on July 22 in protest against overcrowding, dire living conditions, and delays in their cases getting to trial. The whereabouts of the majority of the detainees was unknown for almost two weeks. On August 3, 2019 the day after official acknowledgement of the whereabouts of the detainees, some lawyers were finally able to meet with some of their clients at the SED. Human Rights Watch interviewed 14 detainees held at the SED, all of whom said they were tortured and held incommunicado during their time there, and heard credible accounts that scores more were also tortured.</p> <p>Sexual violence (articles 3 & 4, Maputo Protocol)</p> <p>Cameroon’s 6th Periodic Report states that “from 2013 to 2017, 313 elements of Defence (sic) Forces were prosecuted before the courts for different offences,” including rape and attempted rape, and notes that 30 of the 313 were convicted and sentenced. The Report however fails to provide evidence of any efforts on the part of the Government of Cameroon to prosecute those implicated in human rights violations, including sexual violence, committed in the Anglophone regions since late 2017, or any details of cases brought against security forces which were tried before courts.</p> <p>The Report states that Sections 295 and 296 of the Penal Code introduced new penalties for offences of rape and Sections 346 and 347 include punishments for “offences on minors accompanied by sexual intercourse or rape.” The Report affirms that 264 cases of rape were prosecuted in 2016 and 309 were prosecuted in 2017, however the Report fails to provide evidence of any investigations or prosecutions of cases of sexual violence. Human Rights Watch documented four cases of sexual violence by security force members. Two women and one girl from a locality in the North-West region each said that BIR soldiers raped them in January 2019. In another case in June 2019, a soldier reportedly raped a woman in Kumbo, North-West region. Human Rights Watch spoke to aid workers in the North-West and South-West regions who expressed concerns that there are many more cases of sexual violence by security forces which go unreported due to survivors’ fear of social stigma.</p> <p>Recommendations:</p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:</p> <p>Take steps, in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the Maputo Protocol, to guarantee the life, dignity, integrity and security of civilians, including specific measures to protect women and girls and to mitigate the risk of sexual violence.</p> <p>Direct local authorities, including law enforcement officials members of the security forces, to protect civilians, including women, girls, and children, in the Anglophone regions from the threat of kidnapping and hold to account authorities who fail in their duties to uphold the safety and security of all civilians, regardless of gender and ethno-linguistic identity.</p> <p>Initiate prompt, independent, and impartial investigations into allegations of rape and sexual and gender-based violence by armed separatists and security forces with the aim of bringing perpetrators to justice.</p> <p>Ensure adequate health and psychosocial services, including comprehensive post-rape medical care, are available to survivors of sexual violence by security forces.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Cameroon has submitted 6 reports in the last 18 years. Cameroon’s 6th periodic report fails to provide any comprehensive account of efforts to mitigate further abuses by security forces against civilians and to ensure that military operations are conducted with respect for human rights. The Report only claims that the International School for Security Forces (EIFORCES) offers a two-week course on human rights and protection of vulnerable persons. The course, albeit useful, can hardly address the urgent need for the government to effectively enforce respect for human rights by security forces and accountability for those who fail to do so. Human Rights Watch continues to document cases of serious abuses by Cameroonian security forces, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, the burning of hundreds of homes, torture and incommunicado detention.These abuses should be addressed by holding the perpetrators to account.</p> <p>Final Recommendations:</p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:</p>",4

1041894477,EXCLUSIVE: What I know about Umaru Dikko’s failed abduction in London – Ex-diplomat,2022-04-29 15:13:18,"<p>Haldu Hananiya, a former Nigerian ambassador to the United Kingdom, has given some insider’s insights into the failed attempt by then Muhammadu Buhari-led military regime to abduct an exiled Nigerian Second Republic minister, Umaru Dikko, in London.</p> <p>Mr Hananiya, a retired army general, now 80, shared his thoughts about the incident in his yet-to-be-released book, ‘All Eyes On Me,’ a copy of which was exclusively obtained by PREMIUM TIMES.</p> <p>The book is a memoir, reflecting on the life and career of Mr Hananiya. It gives the author’s account of Nigeria’s Civil War, the Cement Armada Scandal, the Buhari-Idiagbon regime’s Decree 4, and the failed attempt to kidnap Mr Dikko in London, the United Kingdom.</p> <p>The book comes about 38 years after the historic episode of the aborted abduction of Mr Dikko in 1984.</p> <p>Mr Buhari, then head of state, whose regime denied involvement in the abduction which caused a tit-for-tat diplomatic row between Nigeria and the UK, is Nigeria’s incumbent president.</p> <p>Mr Hananiya said the incident was nothing short of “a harrowing experience” for him as the then Nigerian High Commissioner in London.</p> <p>He said he had to lie to British authorities about the “Dikko kidnapping affair” even though he was not involved in the planning.</p> <p>“I was not put in the picture,” Mr Hananiya said, “But in all my interactions with the British authorities, I stood my ground that the federal government of Nigeria had nothing to do with the abduction of Dikko.</p> <p>“I later learned that Lt General Yakubu Danjuma, then a retired officer and Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, an intelligence officer still in service, and a few others were involved in the planning.”</p> <p>The former envoy said he was incensed by the whole incident and was under considerable pressure from the British authorities. “Despite my misgivings, Mr Hananiya said, “I had to defend my country.”</p> <p>The former high commissioner added that, throughout the period, he was in touch with Lagos, then Nigeria’s capital, and could easily access Mr Buhari and his then second-in-command, Tunde Idiagbon, “but it had been decided that I was not to be informed.”</p> <p>“When I expressed anger about not being taken into confidence on the issue, they claimed they didn’t want me to get involved because of the office I occupied.”</p> <p>The Dikko abduction saga</p> <p>An attempt to kidnap and repatriate the exiled former minister, Mr Dikko, was foiled by a vigilant British customs officer in London in 1984.</p> <p>A controversial politician, Mr Dikko was Minister of Transportation in the Shehu Shagari administration from 1979 till December 31, 1983, when the government was toppled by the military, and Mr Buhari became the head of state.</p> <p>Mr Dikko as well as some ministers in the Shagari administration fled to exile as the new military regime began to clamp down on the previous administration’s officials accused of embezzling public funds during their time in office.</p> <p>Mr Dikko, who died aged 77 in London in 2014, always denied the corruption allegations levelled against him by the Buhari regime.</p> <p>One of the most outspoken officials in the Shagari administration, Mr Dikko, who fled to London after the ouster of the Shagari regime, remained one of the main targets of the new military junta.</p> <p>The regime went after him, and in an off-the-book covert operation, the Nigerian security operatives supported by Israeli counterparts, seized him outside his house in London and bundled him into a transit van. He was driven to the Stansted airport, where he was to be flown as “diplomatic baggage” to Lagos to face charges of allegedly stealing $1 billion.</p> <p>His captors handcuffed him, drugged him, and stuffed him, in chains, into a specially made crate with a doctor by his side maintaining a tube on his throat to keep him alive.</p> <p>The plot flopped when Charles Marrow, the British Customs officer, suspected foul play, got the police to abort the trip. The Buhari junta denied any role in the failed mission, which resulted in a major diplomatic spat between Nigeria and Britain for two years.</p> <p>The then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, protested to the Federal Military Government of Nigeria over the kidnapping “which is seen as an inexcusable, if not inexplicable abuse of diplomatic status.”</p> <p>‘Difficult situation’</p> <p>Mr Hananiya, the former Nigerian High Commissioner in London, was at the centre of the storm during the abduction saga.</p> <p>He quoted an Editorial by the Telegraph, a British broadsheet newspaper, captured the difficult situation he found himself in.</p> <p>Advertisements</p> <p>Whether positive or negative, any response by the Nigerian High Commissioner to the question of waiving diplomatic immunity on the accused persons was bad for him.</p> <p>“If he refused, everyone would assume that the Nigerian government was indeed involved in the plot to kidnap Dikko….and if he agreed and Nigerian diplomats were interviewed by the police and subsequently prosecuted and convicted, “the morals of Major General Buhari’s regime will not be at a premium,” the Telegraph had opined.</p> <p>The diplomat, however, chose to “defend his country,” a decision that made him lose his job as a High Commissioner.</p> <p>Frosty diplomatic relationship with the UK</p> <p>When the abduction of Mr Dikko failed, the British police promptly detained Nigeria Airways aircraft and arrested four persons in connection to the issue. In retaliation, the Nigerian government also detained a commercial British Caledonian plane carrying 220 passengers in Lagos.</p> <p>The four men – three Israeli nationals and one Nigerian national – were charged with kidnapping – a common-law offence and with administering drugs with intent to kidnap.</p> <p>When the trials were finally concluded, Alexander Barak, an Israeli described as the leader of the kidnap group, bagged 14 years jail term. Two of his compatriots, Lew Arie Shapiro and Felix Abitbol, received 10 years each, while Mohammed Yesufu, a Nigerian, was sentenced to 12 years.</p> <p>The Nigerian and Israeli governments have always denied involvement in the kidnapping.</p> <p>The British government also implicated two members of the Nigerian High Commission diplomatic staff members, Peter Oyedele, and Okon Edet, as having engaged in activities “incompatible with their status.” They requested Messrs Oyedele and Edet to leave the United Kingdom within one week.</p> <p>Nigeria responded similarly by asking that two persons from the British High Commission also leave Nigeria within the same period. Nigeria further asked the British High Commissioner to Nigeria to return to London while Mr Hananiya was recalled and reassigned to another post.</p> <p>The Book – ‘All Eyes On Me’</p> <p>PREMIUM TIMES earlier reported a part of the book where Mr Hananiya explained why the then Buhari regime hurriedly promulgated the infamous Public Officers Protection Against False Accusation law, popularly known as ‘Decree 4’ in 1984.</p> <p>It was under the stringent law that Nduka Irabor and Tunde Thompson – two reporters with The Guardian – “were tried and jailed for refusing to divulge the source of a story published by the newspaper.”</p> <p>Mr Buhari had planned to appoint Mr Hananiya and seven other top military officers for posting as ambassadors. But, in their exclusive report, The Guardian reported the regime’s plan to replace Mr Hananiya’s name with that of another General, IBM Haruna.</p> <p>Angered by this exclusive report, Mr Buhari applied the law under Decree Four to try and subsequently jail the two journalists.</p> <p>In the book, ‘All Eyes on Me,’ Mr Hananiya has confirmed that “There was indeed an attempt to replace my name with Haruna’s (another army General) as the High Commissioner to the UK.”</p> <p>He added that: “The Guardian story was indeed accurate and that the journalists were punished not for any professional infraction but rather for the embarrassment the information leakage caused the duo of Buhari and his then deputy, the late Major General Tunde Idiagbon.”</p> <p>In another section of the book, Mr Hananiya wrote about the “critical role that military engineers played during the civil war when they led in opening new routes, dismantling mines, and constructing bridges so that the fighting troops could move without any hindrance.”</p> <p>Overall, while ‘All Eyes On Me’ may be the story of one man, Olusegun Adeniyi, who wrote the foreword to the book, noted: “It is also, in several respects, the story of Nigeria and some of the choices that have led us to where we are today.”</p> <p>Mr Adeniyi, a former spokesperson to the late President Umar Yar’adua and chairman of Thisday Newspaper’s editorial board, describes Mr Hananiya’s book as “highly revealing.”</p>",4

Tales and promises about planned rescues have since deteriorated into mere whispers.”</p> <p>He continued, “Every day, we hear of failure of intelligence, yet, those experts who provide intelligence claim that they have always done their duty diligently and efficiently. Does the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria not believe that he owes parents and citizens answers as to where our children are and when they are coming home?”</p> <p>The bishop warned that Nigeria is “fully in the grip of evil, adding: “Today, a feeling of vindication only saddens me as I have watched the north break into a cacophony of quarrelsome blame games over our tragic situation.”</p> <p>The People’s Gazette reports that the State Security Service is a “federal secret police” that holds a reputation for intimidating and arresting government critics.</p> <p>The Southern Kaduna People’s Union, which has spoken out against insecurity in the Kaduna state, has urged Bishop Kukah not to accept the agency’s invitation for questioning, arguing that other critics who have been called in for questioning have been silenced.</p> <p>SOKAPU National Youth Leader Issac John Sirjay argued in a statement Monday that the government has “extended invitations to some people who had at one time or the other accepted invitations, particularly persons considered to be critical of the nepotistic and clandestine leadership style of the Buhari administration.”</p> <p>“We mourned the sudden demise of Dr. Obadiah Mailafia of blessed memory who until his death was a dogged critic of this administration and a regular visitor at one of the DSS facilities,” Sirjay’s statement reads, according to the United States-based outlet Sahara Reporters.</p> <p>“Without ruling out any possibility of harm, we consider the invitation of Bishop Kukah by the DSS as one of such ploy designed to silence him at all cost.”</p> <p>“In light of the above, it suffices to state boldly that the DSS has unarguably deviated from its core mandate of protecting national security and has become a willing tool for the suppression of free speech,” the statement added.</p> <p>Last November, a Nigerian journalist and Roman Catholic, Luka Binniyat, was detained allegedly for his reporting about attacks against predominantly Christian communities and the government’s response.</p> <p>Binniyat, a father who writes for the anti-communist newspaper Epoch Times, was arrested and arraigned at the Barnawa Magistrate’s Court in Kaduna state. He was charged with cyberstalking — a charge critics say is often used in the African country to silence the media.</p> <p>He was arrested after writing an Oct. 29 article titled “In Nigeria, Police Decry Massacres as ‘Wicked’ But Make No Arrests.”</p> <p>The article is part of The Epoch Times’ coverage of the deadly attacks targeting the predominantly-Christian farming communities in the West African country’s Middle Belt.</p> <p>Binniyat pushed back against government official's characterization of an attack on Christian farmers in the state as a “clash.” The Nigerian government has long claimed that violence in Nigeria’s Middle Belt results from decades-old farmer-herder clashes that have been exacerbated in recent years by more herders migrating south due to desertification and climate change.</p> <p>Critics have warned that the Nigerian government’s lack of action in the Middle Belt could result in a religious “genocide.” But the Nigerian government has pushed back on such assertions.</p> <p>According to a recent study from the Anambra-based International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, at least 60,000 Christians have been killed in the past two decades in Nigeria. The organization, which is run by Christian criminologist Emeka Umeagbalasi, reports that hundreds of churches have been threatened, attacked, closed, destroyed or burned in 2021.</p> <p>In the northern parts of Nigeria, criminal groups and terrorists have conducted several large-scale abductions of school children in recent years. In 2014, about 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped from a school in Chibok in the northeast Borno state by the Islamic radical group Boko Haram. As many as 112 of those girls remain missing.</p> <p>In February 2021, armed militants kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls from the Government Girls Science Secondary School in Jangebe, Zamfara state. The children were released weeks later.</p> <p>Watchdog group Open Doors USA, which monitors persecution in over 60 countries, ranks Nigeria as the ninth-worst country when it comes to Christian persecution.</p>",4
925298509,"Animal rights activist is accused of staging dog abuse, torture",2020-05-24 00:00:00,"<p>The videos are horrifying. In one, a black dog hangs by its neck, crying and convulsing as it is blowtorched alive. In another, a white dog dangles from a wooden beam, writhing in pain and terror.</p> <p>The footage came from a 2016 trip to Asia by Marc Ching, a Los Angeles resident who spent nearly a decade in prison for a violent crime before transforming himself into a prominent leader in the local, national and international animal rights communities.</p> <p>Ching has told supporters that those videos and others were recorded to document the torture and slaughter of dogs at meat markets in Indonesia, Cambodia and other countries in Asia with a limited but enduring trade in butchering the animals for human food.</p> <p>The gruesome images appear on social media and in an emotional public service announcement that features a roster of celebrities, including Matt Damon, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara, and promotes a charitable foundation that Ching started. The Animal Hope & Wellness Foundation has raised millions of dollars for the purpose of rescuing dogs and cats from Asian slaughterhouses.</p> <p>“It shows you why this has to end,” Ching said after screening the videos at a House briefing in 2016 on Capitol Hill. As he showed the torture scenes, audience members gasped and averted their eyes. “How can you do that to an animal?” Ching asked.</p> <p>But a Times investigation has found evidence that contradicts Ching’s claims about the authenticity of some of the most shocking videos and raises questions about his rescue efforts overseas.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ching, shown at a 2015 fundraiser, garnered celebrity support from the likes of Matt Damon, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara. (Angela Weiss / Getty Images)</p> <p>Butchers in Indonesia have told The Times that Ching paid them to hang the black dog and burn it to death — a method of killing more cruel than any they say they normally employ — so he could stage the scene for the camera.</p> <p>In appeals to the public and foundation supporters, Ching has presented videos of that incident and others as candid portrayals of the day-to-day routine at the slaughterhouses he documented mostly while “undercover,” posing as a dog meat buyer. But local animal rights activists in Indonesia, Cambodia and elsewhere in Asia say they have never heard of dogs being regularly tortured or killed in some of the ways depicted by Ching.</p> <p>And raw footage of Ching’s recordings obtained by The Times casts doubt on whether all of the videos show how butchers typically torture and kill the dogs.</p> <p>One of the unedited clips captures the dog being burned alive. In a sworn court declaration filed in August 2017, Ching wrote that he happened to be investigating the dog meat trade at a market in Tomohon, Indonesia, when he and his interpreter “stumbled upon” the burning.</p> <p>Ching wrote that it “was taking place in broad daylight while passersby ignored the dog’s screams. My translator filmed the gruesome act only to use as evidence of the cruelty happening in Indonesia.”</p> <p>But nearly seven minutes of the raw footage shows the dog being pulled from a cage with a noose and carried through the market by a butcher while Ching’s camera follows him from behind. The camera continues to roll as the animal is strung up by its neck and slowly torched to death. As the dog burns, the butcher looks toward the camera and gives a thumbs up.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Marthen Wondang, a butcher at the Tomohon market, said Ching in 2016 bought four dogs at an inflated price and asked that they be killed in particular ways, including torching one alive, while he recorded video. (Ronny Adolof Buol / For The Times)</p> <p>Ching, 41, denied orchestrating that scene or any other and said he never instructed butchers on how to maim or kill dogs.</p> <p>“If the question is if I pay people to torture dogs — no, I don’t,” Ching said.</p> <p>In an interview and a subsequent email to The Times, Ching said the allegations against him were motivated in part by rivalries among animal rescuers. Ching accused two activists of conspiring to bribe a butcher in Indonesia to say Ching paid to stage the burning of living dogs.</p> <p>“Groups slander each other constantly based on the fact that they believe or feel they know better,” he said in the email.</p> <p>“If the question is if I pay people to torture dogs — no, I don’t.” — Marc Ching</p> <p>The animal rights activists deny bribing any butchers, and The Times found no evidence of a conspiracy to falsely accuse Ching of wrongdoing.</p> <p>::</p> <p>Ching’s foundation held a gala fundraiser in 2017 at the W Hotel in Hollywood, drawing the likes of No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal, who told an interviewer at the event that Ching was a “superhero.” Others in attendance referred to him as an “Earth angel.”</p> <p>California Animal rescue charity with star-studded support has ‘troubling’ financial practices, experts say A whistleblower and watchdogs raise concerns over cash withdrawals, allegedly deceptive solicitations and other financial practices at the Animal Hope & Wellness Foundation. The charity denies misleading donors or misusing money.</p> <p>In March 2019, musician Moby and actresses Alicia Silverstone and Shannen Doherty attended a Culver City fundraiser for the foundation that was hosted by comedian Whitney Cummings. Doherty, who once sat on his charity board, told an interviewer at the event that Ching had “the greatest spirit and always the best of intentions.”</p> <p>As the star power elevated Ching’s profile, the foundation helped secure a federal law that effectively banned the human consumption of dog and cat meat and a California prohibition on new fur products. Donations continued to roll in.</p> <p>The Times’ investigation also found that Ching’s charity has engaged in financial practices that nonprofit experts say are troubling. Foundation records show that more than $350,000 in cash was withdrawn from the charity in a period of 27 months and that Ching has billed the foundation for at least $59,000 in food and other products from his for-profit pet nutrition business, the Petstaurant.</p> <p>In emails to The Times, and through statements by the foundation’s attorneys, the organization said Ching never misused funds and had contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars in goods, services and cash to the charity since 2014.</p> <p>Last month, the Federal Trade Commission accused Ching of making false or deceptive claims that an herbal supplement he was selling could treat COVID-19 and that some of his other products could treat cancer. Ching denied wrongdoing and said he was cooperating with the commission.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Board members who oversee Ching’s foundation initially declined to meet with The Times, and the organization at one point suggested the newspaper had tried to persuade people to lie about Ching and the charity.</p> <p>Dr. Barbara Gitlitz, a Los Angeles oncologist who chaired the charity’s board at the time, eventually sat for an interview in January in the Wilshire Boulevard offices of the foundation’s attorneys. She said she had no reason to doubt Ching’s accounts of the dog torture and that she questioned the credibility of the butchers who accused him of paying them to stage abuse.</p> <p>“It just goes against everything that I know about Marc and how he treats animals,” Gitlitz said.</p> <p>Two days later, she emailed The Times to say the board was launching an independent investigation. She and a foundation attorney did not respond to follow-up questions about the investigation, including a query on who conducted it. The foundation also did not respond to questions of whether any recent changes had been made in the board membership, including the chair position.</p> <p>In a recent email, the attorney, Russell M. Selmont, said the charity had found no evidence that Ching “ever staged the burning of any dogs (at Tomohon market or otherwise) or ever knowingly or intentionally contributed to the harm of any animals.”</p> <p>He called the butchers’ accounts unreliable and said Ching’s videos threatened “to expose their inhumanity and shut down their livelihoods. The notion that Mr. Ching paid these butchers to burn and torture the dogs is sick, twisted fantasy.”</p> <p>A dog is squeezed in a narrow iron cage at the Tomohon market. (Ronny Adolof Buol / For The Times)</p> <p>::</p> <p>Ching has publicly drawn on his time in prison to explain his devotion to the plight of caged animals. At a 2017 animal rights march in Los Angeles, he delivered a tearful speech, telling demonstrators that during a long stretch in solitary confinement, a scout ant crawled into his cell and took a nibble of a little ball of bread he had saved to lure the insect. The ant left, he said, but in about an hour and a half thousands of them were in his cell.</p> <p>“It was the first time in so long that I had the contact of anybody or anything,” he told the crowd, his voice catching.</p> <p>But Ching, who was born in Hawaii and attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has revealed little about what landed him behind bars.</p> <p>In what authorities called a “heinous” and “sophisticated” crime, Ching and several accomplices abducted a man who had stolen $60,000 in a drug deal, bound his hands and drove him to a hotel, where they removed his pants and beat him at length, court records show.</p> <p>Corrections officials said he served nine years and seven months in prison for kidnapping and causing great bodily injury. Valarie Ianniello, former executive director of the foundation, said Ching told her he spent 11 months in solitary confinement. A California prisons spokeswoman said there was no record he was ever placed in any type of solitary housing.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ching did not dispute the lack of such a record, but he said in an email to The Times: “My experience is my experience. And because your definition of confinement differs from mine, that does not make my experience not true.”</p> <p>Two years after his release in 2010, Ching registered his pet food business and the Animal Hope & Wellness Foundation with the state. He describes himself as a fourth-generation herbalist and nutritionist. He also opened the Petstaurant store on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. In 2015, Ching began making regular trips to Asia and posting disturbing images on social media.</p> <p>“In Asia once I watched them crucify dogs….

(Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)</p> <p>The segment has been viewed more than 3.9 million times. Viewers praised him online as a hero. Contributions to his foundation surged — from about $110,000 in 2015 to nearly $2 million the next year, according to the charity’s tax records.</p> <p>“I think he recognized that he could be worshiped by this stuff,” Ianniello said. “The money came in, and it helped build his business up.”</p> <p>Ching has opened a second Petstaurant on the Westside.</p> <p>::</p> <p>There is no dispute that dogs and cats are killed for food in countries across Asia, especially outside the major cities. Local activists in those countries have long fought to end the practice, often working in league with Westerners.</p> <p>Foreign and U.S. activists interviewed by The Times said the methods used by butchers to round up and kill the animals — packing them into cages, drowning them, clubbing them on the head and, in some cases, hanging them — are uniformly inhumane.</p> <p>They said there had been instances when animal abusers burned dogs alive or brutalized them in other ways, and images of the cruelty are posted online. And there have been many times when butchers, after striking a dog’s skull to kill it, burn the animal to de-fur it, even though it is still alive.</p> <p>But all of the activists, including seven who do work in Asia, said their efforts had found no evidence to support the notion that the dogs are routinely and deliberately burned or boiled alive, or tortured with beatings and mutilations on a regular basis as Ching has described.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“We’ve never seen animals boiled alive, never seen animals beaten or paws cut or anything,” said Lee Fox-Smith, an author who co-founded the Campaign to End the Dog Meat Trade in Cambodia. Since 2017, Fox-Smith said, he has visited more than 200 slaughterhouses and restaurants that serve dog meat.</p> <p>He said he initially was afraid to investigate the meat trade because he had heard Ching’s tales of danger. But when he started visiting slaughterhouses, he said, he found that they were the “complete opposite” of Ching’s portrayals.</p> <p>“People aren’t chasing you with machetes and guns,” Fox-Smith said.</p> <p>He said he first contacted Ching through Facebook in 2018 and offered to help Ching’s foundation shelter dogs rescued in Cambodia. They met twice in that country, Fox-Smith said, and he questioned Ching during the second meeting about Ching’s claim that dogs were boiled alive in Cambodia.</p> <p>Fox-Smith said Ching told him, “They don’t really torture the dogs in Cambodia.”</p> <p>“He’s basically taking the most vulnerable animals in our society and exploiting them … and it’s disgusting,” Fox-Smith said.</p> <p>He said Ching was cagey in answering other questions and declined to disclose the locations of slaughterhouses he had visited, making it impossible for Fox-Smith to verify Ching’s claims.</p> <p>A still from the video shows butcher Marthen Wondang flashing a thumbs up toward the camera. “This is exactly what you want, right?” he is heard asking in a local language as a dog is torched.

Ching denied doing so, and his foundation questioned the butchers’ credibility, saying his work threatened their livelihoods.</p> <p>The market has earned a grisly reputation thanks to social media and animal welfare campaigns.</p> <p>In one section under brightly colored tarpaulins, vendors hawk local favorites such as smoked skipjack tuna, spiky golden pineapples and tropical jeruk manis oranges that turn green when ripened.</p> <p>The center of the bazaar features rats impaled on bamboo sticks, listless reticulated pythons coiled into mounds and charred bats, mouths agape and showing off rows of fangs and thick, pointy tongues.

Wondang said Ching bought four dogs at an inflated price and asked that they be killed in particular ways, including torching one alive, while he recorded video.</p> <p>Ching “was smiling and laughing throughout the process … like he was happy.” — Marthen Wondang, butcher</p> <p>Wondang and the other butchers said they typically killed dogs by beating them on the head. Burning dogs to death, they said, would be too costly in terms of kerosene and more likely to result in the butchers getting bitten or scratched.</p> <p>Strangely, Wondang said, Ching left the dog meat behind after he finished recording.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“He was smiling and laughing throughout the process,” he said of Ching. “Like he was happy.”</p> <p>Ching did not respond to a question about that claim. He said one of the butchers, whom he did not identify, told him in 2016 that they burned 50 dogs to death a day at the market.</p> <p>In interviews with The Times, animal welfare activists based in Europe and Asia said some of the butchers had given them the same account of Ching paying to have the dog burned alive on camera. They said the butchers told them this separately at various times between late 2017 and spring 2018, well before The Times began its investigation.</p> <p>Lola Webber, Bali-based co-founder and director of the Change for Animals Foundation, a charity registered in England, told The Times she visited the Tomohon market around Christmas 2017. She said “maybe three” butchers, including one she recognized from Ching’s videos, together approached her group asking whether they were with Ching. Webber said she told them no.</p> <p>A dog lies inside a cage at the Tomohon market. (Ronny Adolof Buol / For The Times)</p> <p>The butchers related that Ching had paid them to torture the dogs on camera in certain ways — one hanged, another torched alive, Webber said.</p> <p>She said she had a similar experience when she visited a meat market in nearby Langowan. About five butchers walked up to her group and asked whether they were associated with Ching, she said.</p> <p>“We said, ‘No, we have nothing to do with Marc Ching,’” Webber added. “They said, ‘Do you want to pay us?’”</p> <p>Webber said Ching’s actions undermined the work of activists devoted to ending the dog meat trade, which kills dogs in ways that are cruel enough. “It’s totally shameful,” she said.</p> <p>Frank Manus manages Animal Friends Manado Indonesia, which operates a shelter in Tomohon. He said that during a brief meeting in 2016, Ching showed him photos of a dog being burned alive at the Tomohon market. Manus said he immediately doubted the photos.</p> <p>Frank Manus, who manages an Indonesian animal rescue organization, said he immediately doubted the photos Ching showed him of a dog being burned alive in Tomohon: “I go to the market every day, and no such thing happens.” (Ronny Adolof Buol / For The Times)</p> <p>“I go to the market every day, and no such thing happens,” Manus said.</p> <p>Other activists have questioned Ching’s videos. He sued one of them: Deborah Hall, a volunteer who posted on Facebook that Ching “paid to have dogs torched and legs cut off,” according to the suit. A judge tossed the part of the lawsuit concerning that statement. Hall declined to comment on the suit, which the parties eventually settled.</p> <p>Sebastian Margenfeld, a German activist, said he first learned of Ching in 2016 when he stumbled upon a YouTube video on Ching’s rescues in Asia. He said it moved him so much that he reached out to Ching’s charity with the goal of producing a public service announcement, or PSA, in German similar to the foundation’s, using the same footage.</p> <p>Soon after, Margenfeld said, he started his own foundation with a name that echoes that of Ching’s charity when translated into English. Margenfeld said the early web postings of his foundation focused on Ching’s work. He added that his foundation later contributed more than $50,000 in funds and services to Ching’s efforts, including the cost of flying American veterinarians to China.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>In the meantime, he said, Ching’s foundation put him in touch with the production company that created its PSA, Sugar Studios LA, which sent Margenfeld a zip file in November 2016 with Ching’s raw footage.</p> <p>Margenfeld said he watched it all. He offered to join Ching on rescue missions, but Ching always refused the help.</p> <p>It wasn’t until he visited Indonesian slaughterhouses in April 2018 to shoot his own footage that he began to question Ching’s footage, Margenfeld said.</p> <p>“Because I had never been to Asian slaughterhouses, I thought it was real,” he said of the torture. “I went to Tomohon and it was so different from Ching’s video.”</p> <p>Margenfeld, who is a physical therapist in the town of Freiburg in southwest Germany, said he told the foundation board members of his suspicions about Ching in a May 2018 conference call. The board members stood by Ching, Margenfeld said.</p> <p>Times investigations Stories like this don’t happen without your support.</p> <p>Subscribe today</p> <p>In 2016, Ching traveled to Cambodia with a professional cameraman to film more slaughterhouses. Raw footage from the trip features long monologues during bumpy car rides in which Ching chokes up as he reflects on what he says he witnessed.</p> <p>“The people that really hurt these animals, they’re going to hurt children,” he says during one ride. “They’re going to molest kids, kidnap people, they’re gonna beat them up.”</p> <p>In one scene, Ching is kneeling beside a brick cage of dogs describing the meat trade for the camera.</p> <p>“How many dogs you want?” his interpreter is heard asking him shortly after.</p> <p>Ching cuts him off by saying “whoa” several times and “time out,” while making a gesture to direct the cameraman to stop shooting. The cameraman points the camera down but keeps it rolling.</p> <p>Dressed in a black T-shirt lettered #CompassionProject with the foundation’s web address, Ching says to the cameraman, “You know going undercover, they show us, just because as a dog meat buyer, usually, this guy is gonna tie one up, he’s gonna hang one over here, and beat him.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“You know, we’re gonna cut him down so he doesn’t kill the dog and stuff,” he continues on the footage. “So are you OK documenting that stuff?”</p> <p>Someone says, “Yeah.” And Ching replies, “I’ll just do one then.”</p> <p>After a few moments, the cameraman asks, “Do you feel like this is necessary?”</p> <p>“It’s up to you,” Ching replied. “I’d rather not document it…. When I go undercover, I don’t know, I like it better, because, like, it’s just natural, you know. They’re doing it already.”</p> <p>A person familiar with the incident said Ching had arranged to have the slaughterhouse hang and beat the dog for the purpose of filming it. The person, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation by Ching, said the hanging and beating ultimately did not occur.</p> <p>× A person familiar with the incident captured on this video clip said Ching had arranged to have the Cambodian slaughterhouse hang and beat the dog for the purpose of filming it. The person said the hanging and beating ultimately did not occur. Ching denied making any arrangement to harm a dog. An attorney for his foundation described the clip as a discussion about filming a “dramatic reenactment” of a previous hanging at the slaughterhouse, without harming the dog.</p> <p>Ching and two Los Angeles attorneys for his foundation offered a series of descriptions of the clip.</p> <p>Jeremy Gray, one of the lawyers, said in an email to The Times that the video from Cambodia “appears to be a misleadingly doctored clip that is removed from its appropriate context.”</p> <p>The Times engaged an audio-visual forensics expert in Michigan, Ed Primeau, to analyze the Cambodia footage. Primeau said he found no evidence that it had been altered.</p> <p>“These video recordings are authentic and represent the events as they occurred,” he said.</p> <p>Ching later said in an email to The Times, “It is likely that the clip recorded a discussion about organizing the filming and that may have included some payment to enter the slaughterhouse.” He said that there was no plan to mistreat a dog and that no animal was hurt.</p> <p>Selmont, the other attorney for the foundation, described the clip as a discussion about filming a “dramatic reenactment” of a previous hanging at the slaughterhouse without harming the dog.</p> <p>“Mr. Ching and the foundation ultimately decided against including anything like that in the documentary and the videographer himself has confirmed that no such event ever occurred,” Selmont said in an email.</p> <p>Selmont said the earlier hanging occurred several months before the discussion on the clip: “Mr. Ching posted an iPhone video of him cutting down a dog that he saw in real time being hung at a dog butcher. Mr. Ching, at that exact moment, paid for the dog and filmed himself in real time cutting down that dog who otherwise [would] have been slaughtered for meat.”</p> <p>The foundation’s PSA includes a shot of Ching cutting a hanging dog free.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>In another clip from Cambodia, a young man in board shorts drops a live dog into a vat of scalding water. As the dog thrashes about, the man quickly jumps back to avoid getting splashed. Moments later, the vat falls over as the dog tries to escape.</p> <p>Activists told The Times that dogs are not normally boiled alive in Cambodia, if only because the butchers could be scalded in the attempt. They said those vats were often used instead to de-fur dead dogs in boiling water. In the background of the Cambodia clip, a second young worker is seen removing the fur from what appears to be a dead dog in a similar tub of steaming water.</p> <p>On numerous occasions, Ching claimed that his life was in danger in Asia. When first asked for details by The Times, Ching responded with written descriptions of two car crashes, getting into altercations in Cambodia and China, being punched in the face in Korea, various encounters with butchers who threatened but did not injure him, and being pushed off a “small cliff” in Taiji, Japan.</p> <p>The Times then presented Ching with information from media interviews and social media posts in which he is quoted as saying that, in addition to several assaults, he was shot at, had a machine gun stuck in his mouth and almost died four times. Ching responded that he had tried to suppress his memories of those incidents — which he has said occurred in recent years — because of their traumatic nature.</p> <p>“Those things happened to me,” Ching said in an email. “Over the years both intentionally and I believe subconsciously I have tried to forget the worst of these experiences as it is best for my mental health.”</p> <p>Ianniello, the foundation’s former executive director, said Ching told her of an incident in which he was pushed to the ground at a slaughterhouse, where he swallowed feces and blood. Ching said that as a result he contracted flesh-eating bacteria that required surgery to eliminate, according to Ianniello and another former foundation employee, Kiana Kang.</p> <p>Ching did not respond to a Times query about the incident. He would not provide The Times with any documentation or other means of verifying the more serious episodes, such as medical records or the names of any witnesses.

987223548,Armed Teacher Thwarts Kidnapping At Utah Elementary School,2021-05-27 00:00:00,"<p>Since 2003, Utah has allowed school staffers with concealed carry licenses to lawfully carry on the job, and while we don’t really have any idea of how many teachers and staff across the state exercise their right to carry a firearm in defense of their students and themselves, we know that there’s at least one teacher in the town of Ogden who’s carrying while on campus, because on Tuesday afternoon they prevented a kidnapping from a school playground.</p> <p>Ira Cox-Berry, 41, approached and grabbed a student, an 11-year-old girl, who was playing on the playground, police said. Cox-Berry allegedly pulled the girl away as if he was trying to leave with her, but a school employee approached Cox-Berry and demanded that he leave the school. Cox-Berry briefly let go of the girl, and the employee was able to get the children who were also nearby into a classroom, according to a police affidavit. Police say there were 19 other children nearby at the time. Cox-Berry then approached the building and started punching a window in an apparent attempt to get inside, police said. The employee then produced a firearm and held off the man while calling 911.</p> <p>Critics of armed school staffers often claim that there’s no way educators could have enough training to actually protect students, that the presence of lawfully-carried guns only increases the risks of others being accidentally injured, and trigger-happy teachers could turn their campus into a Wild West war zone. Of course they don’t have any evidence for any of their arguments, because the reality is that none of the scary predictions from the opponents of armed school staffers have ever come to pass.</p> <p>In this case, the staffer acted completely rationally and professionally. They didn’t even display their firearm until the potential kidnapping situation had escalated into violence. Far from the “shoot first, ask questions later” mentality that anti-gun activists claim is inherent among those of us who exercise our right to carry, this staffer demonstrated restraint and caution; shepherding the students under their care into a classroom while keeping an eye out on the stranger. Only when the suspect tried to gain entrance to the school did the staffer pull out their firearm, and even then, the trigger was never pulled.</p> <p>Lt. Brian Eynon with the Ogden Police Department praised the school employee after the suspect was taken into custody.</p> <p>“This employee is protected under the Second Amendment. He followed all policy and procedure at the school, and in this particular case, did everything that he should have done to protect the innocent lives of the children at the school,” says the Lieutenant. “And in this case, it is likely that a life was saved or injury to a life was prevented due to the actions of this heroic employee.”</p> <p>School officials were quick to hail the quick thinking of the staffer as well.</p> <p>“A teacher intervened when there was a situation that threatened students safety. This teacher, this school employee, is a hero. We don’t disagree with that at all,” Ogden School District’s Jer Bates tells us. “Yes, it was a very scary situation, something we take very seriously, but it came out with a good ending, meaning no students were physically harmed, no adults were physically harmed, that this was an incident where out emergency response protocols were acted out.”</p> <p>While police and the school district are praising the teacher, don’t expect the Utah chapter of Moms Demand Action to do the same. The anti-gun group hates the idea of allowing trained school staff to carry in defense of students and employees, claiming that laws like the one in Utah places “children at risk of unintentional shootings and escalating conflict without decreasing the risk of an active shooter.”</p> <p>I’m not aware of a single unintentional shooting from a legally armed school staffer anywhere in the coutnry, but we’ve got proof that armed school employees can and have protected the lives of the students in their care. Kudos to the Ogden teacher for thwarting this kidnapping, even if gun control activists like Shannon Watts would like to pretend it never happened.</p>",4

Natividad “Naty” Castro, said the doctor was arrested by the San Juan City Police in their home around 9:30 in the morning. The office of San Juan City Police chief Police Colonel Elpidio Ramirez confirmed Castro’s arrest.</p> <p>In a statement on Friday, the Philippine National Police (PNP) also confirmed Dr. Castro’s arrest and tagged her as an alleged central committee member of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA). The PNP also said Dr. Castro was the alleged head of the CPP-NPA’s National Health Bureau.</p> <p>However, her brother told Rappler that Dr. Castro worked in Mindanao to provide medical services and human rights assistance. The arrested doctor also went home to San Juan City in 2020 to take care of their mother.</p> <p>Jun told Rappler that the cases filed against his sister were all related to the doctor’s work as a human rights and development worker. In the warrant of arrest obtained by Rappler, Castro was among the many respondents in the kidnapping and serious illegal detention cases filed in Agusan del Sur.</p> <p>The warrant of arrest against Castro and others was issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch 7 in Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur. The warrant for the non-bailable cases was issued as early as January 2020.</p> <p>In a statement on Saturday, February 19, the PNP said that Castro was brought to and detained in Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur, where the court that issued the arrest warrant is located.</p> <p>The PNP said that her alleged “membership” in the local communist movement is not the basis of the arrest “but her alleged criminal actions that constitute participation in a case of kidnapping with serious illegal detention.”</p> <p>The police said that the CHR has already been informed about Castro’s status, but the statement was silent on her right to counsel and if due process was violated. Castro’s lawyers earlier said they were denied information and documents related to her case.</p> <p>Prior to her arrest, Castro had been red-tagged for her human rights advocacy, according to her brother. She served as secretary general of rights group Karapatan in Caraga region.</p> <p>Before the pandemic hit the country in 2020, Castro started several health programs in Mindanao. She also brought a member of the Lumad community to the United Nations in Geneva to seek help against harassment in Lumad areas.</p> <p>Play Video</p> <p>Castro was the high school valedictorian of St. Scholastica’s Manila batch 1986 and was among the 100 most outstanding students of the educational institution in the last century. She graduated cum laude with a degree in Zoology at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, then later on at the UP College of Medicine in 1995.</p> <p>Castro is the latest rights and development worker arrested since the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte intensified its crackdown against progressive individuals. – Rappler.com</p>",4

They received phone calls from people in Chicago and Minneapolis informing them the FBI was raiding their homes. Burke thought the FBI might raid his house. He decided his daughter needed to get to kindergarten before the FBI entered his home. He left with his daughter.</p> <p>The next thing Burke did was write a press release. He took his computer, got in his car to go find a “web cafe.” New to Grand Rapids, Michigan, he had little idea where to drive. He took two left turns and noticed a car behind him took two left turns too. It didn’t seem right to Burke. He took another left turn, and the car behind him also took a left turn too.</p> <p>Burke decided the FBI was following them. He called his wife, and they agreed he should drive to the parking garage at her work. As Burke reached the parking garage, the car that had followed him sped off. An SUV sped into the road right behind him and followed him into the garage. Burke was served with a subpoena to appear before a grand jury. His wife was later served with a subpoena too.</p> <p>“An agent said you’re being investigated for ‘material support to a terrorist organization’ and specifically it said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),” recalled Burke. “Myself, I’ve been the spokesman for the National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, where we protested outside the trial in Washington, D.C., of a Colombian revolutionary and one of dozens of FARC leaders who was put on trial. We don’t think he should have been put on trial in this country at all. We think they are angry at us for doing political organizing and exercising our right to free speech.”</p> <p>Burke told the story of Ricardo Palmera saying he was a professor born into a wealthy family in Colombia. He attended the naval academy. In the 1960s, just before graduation, he decided to become a professor. Palmera chose to become a social activist and work to change Colombia so peasants in his country would no longer be violently exploited and oppressed. Soon friends were being tortured.</p> <p>The following decade Palmera “found that almost all his friends except for one of the founders of a group called Citizen Action, [a woman], were dead.” Military and death squads killed them in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Palmera thought he had a choice between becoming a refugee and joining the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia. He fought as a member of the Patriotic Union.</p> <p>Palmera was captured by the Colombian government, seized in Ecuadorm and extradited to the U.S. in 2004. The U.S. government put him on trial. The first trial, according to Burke, was a “terrorist trial that led to a hung jury.” During the second one, “Federal Judge Hogan was found cheating with a U.S. prosecutor and had to step down.”</p> <p>The jury could not find Palmera guilty of “terrorism,” but they did find him guilty of “belonging to the FARC” and so he was charged, mostly because he was found to have been involved in the kidnapping of three U.S. military contractors.</p> <p>“That charge should have carried only a 7-year maximum sentence, but the judge gave him sixty years,” explained Burke. He is now in solitary confinement in a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, “being held as a political prisoner.”</p> <p>The FARC are, according to the National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, an “independent peasants’ movement.” A description of the FARC on the Committee’s website claims “one third” of FARC fighters are women.</p> <p>But the U.S., which has forces intervening in the conflict in Colombia, considers the FARC to be terrorists, not a recognized military force at war with the military force backed by the Colombian government. This means the capturing of U.S. contractors, while FARC argues this was simply an act of taking prisoners of war, was regarded as something “against the law of all civilized nations.”</p> <p>According to his profile on the Committee to Stop FBI Repression’s website, Burke has most recently been “a stay home dad of a five-year old daughter. Tom grew up in the blue-collar suburbs of Chicago and received degrees from both the University of Illinois-Champaign-Urbana and the University of Illinois-Chicago. He then worked as a school custodian and building engineer in the Oak Park schools for 14 years, where he won an Illinois State award for service. Tom Burke was a union steward, union organizer, and elected to the Executive Board of Local 73, Service Employees International Union with 23,000 members.”</p> <p>Burke shared how he and his wife have been active since the days when college students protested apartheid. He notes President Obama was part of that movement and supported Nelson Mandela, “who until three years ago was still on the U.S. terrorist list.”</p> <p>“We’re proud that we were part of that successful movement to end apartheid. And we continue to be active around international solidarity. And so when were subpoenaed, we were shocked,” said Burke. “We don’t think the U.S. should have political police with the FBI, who are serving an agenda of building a U.S. empire. Activists like ourselves have a right to organize, a right to free speech, to speak out, to not have our houses searched, to not have our government demand our computers, our cell phones. We also think we have a right to not speak at a secret trial.”</p> <p>A grand jury is not like trials most Americans have seen play out. Burke addressed how a grand jury works.</p> <p>“As an activist or any citizen, your called to face a grand jury where there’s no judge in the proceedings. There’s only the U.S. prosecutor. It’s like a preemptive trial. So, the US prosecutor gets to pick the twenty-three jurors. There’s no one from your side in the room.” [For more info, read this post put together by a blogger at Firedoglake.]</p> <p>The U.S. prosecutor guides the twenty-three through the process. Those jurors tend to want to help and identify with the prosecutor. When you enter the room, your lawyer is not allowed to be with you. You have to excuse yourself and go to the hallway to talk to your lawyer. The media is not allowed to watch it and you can’t have your family or friends in the room to support you either. All of that, and more, is why Burke and his wife decided to never cooperate with the grand jury.</p> <p>Finally, Burke emphasized, “We’ve been doing solidarity work with people in other countries who get killed for doing what they do. When I went to Colombia in 2003, a labor union delegation my union local SEIU, at that time three Colombian trade unionists were being killed every single week. And that was the scariest week of my life.”</p> <p>Burke was with the human rights director of the oil workers union, and all week he had to have armed security and know who was with the group and whether they were in a safe place.</p> <p>“Every week, a Colombian trade unionist gets killed,” Burke declared.</p>",4

1005763993,"Evil, Crazy, or Just Plain Stupid? Top 10 Quotes from Middle East Studies Professors",2021-09-23 00:00:00,"<p>It is (dis)comforting to know that as college students return to classes this fall, after a tumultuous year filled with uncertainty, some familiar qualities of academe remain: skyrocketing tuition, meddlesome administrators, and deranged pontifications by professors of Middle East studies.</p> <p>Since its founding in 2002, Campus Watch, which critiques Middle East studies at North America universities, has posted 275 outrageous public statements by Middle East studies professors under the rubric ""Howler of the Month.""</p> <p>Picking the worst of them is arduous, given the quantity of vitriolic, conspiracy-mongering nonsense. Still, we embrace this job with great good humor or, when required, grim resolve.</p> <p>For the complete listing, see our frequently updated archives.</p> <p>Rabab Abdulhadi (left) praised Palestinian hijacker Leila Khaled as ""somebody who actually stands up for herself, speaks for herself, actually goes to a plane and hijacks it.""</p> <p>The selections below were chosen on their individual merits, so to speak. Some are blatantly vile, others unintentionally comical, but all illustrate the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of Middle East studies in North America. Each speaker should recoil in shame when confronted with his own words, but we aren't so naïve as to expect it.</p> <p>Wading through the archives was rather like reading Dante's Inferno or C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters, but with an obvious difference of authorial intent. Whereas the poet and the apologist seek to persuade their readers to pursue virtue by illustrating vice, our professors spew vice while masquerading as purveyors of virtue.</p> <p>Below we expose some of their most infamous statements – and have a little fun while we're at it. The winners follow, with brief commentary, in chronological order:</p> <p>1. ""We really idolize somebody like Leila Khaled, somebody who actually stands up for herself, speaks for herself, actually goes to a plane and hijacks it."" Rabab Abdulhadi, professor in Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas/Race and Resistance Studies at San Francisco State University. Goldengate Express, September 22, 2020.</p> <p>Who doesn't get misty-eyed recalling the grand old days of Palestinian airline hijackings? What better way to preserve that glorious legacy than teaching students to idolize the Queen of Terror at 30,000 Feet, Leila Khaled? Back in 1970, Khaled helped hijack an El Al flight but failed to blow it up when her grenade didn't explode. A role model for the ages.</p> <p>Jonathan Brown: ""I don't think it's morally evil to own somebody.""</p> <p>2. ""I don't think you can talk about slavery in Islam until you realize that there is no such thing as slavery. . . . Slavery cannot just be treated as a moral evil in and of itself. I don't think it's morally evil to own somebody because we own lots of people all around us. And we're owned by people."" Jonathan Brown, Alwaleed bin Talal Chair of Islamic Civilization at Georgetown University. From a lecture at the Islamist-run International Institute of Islamic Thought, in IPT News, February 13, 2017.</p> <p>Most of us yokels, when asked our opinion on slavery, would condemn it in the strongest possible terms. But most of us don't shoulder the heavy burdens of Jonathan Brown, who lives the double life of university professor and Islamist. How to speak publicly on slavery in Islam, then, while fulfilling dueling identities? Try to muddy the waters so that decent people aren't appalled, but slavery-supporting Islamists won't think you're a sell-out. But Brown blew it by failing to grasp that contemporary slavery isn't a terribly ambiguous issue for normal people. This episode tells us all we need to know about both Brown's common decency and his common sense.</p> <p>3. ""Compared to the scale of death and destruction that the U.S. has unleashed on major cities in Afghanistan and Iraq, and later Bashar al-Assad and his nemesis have visited upon Syria, the destruction of those two [World Trade Center] towers now appears as entirely negligible, even remembering them perhaps an insult to the memories of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings maimed and murdered and turned into hopeless refugees in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya or Syria."" Hamid Dabashi, Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. Published in Al-Jazeera on the fifteenth anniversary of 9/11, September 11, 2016.</p> <p>Hamid Dabashi would be cringe-worthy as a second-rate literary villain. As a chaired professor, he's testimony to academe's moral and intellectual depravity. Unabashedly anti-Semitic, spiteful toward his adopted country, less a revolutionary than shallow narcissist, Dabashi's writings insult the memories of those slaughtered on 9/11.</p> <p>4. ""Israeli complaints that Gaza is controlled by the party-militia, Hamas, freely elected in 2006, and that Hamas fires (mostly small, home-made and ineffectual) rockets into Israel, are irrelevant to the requirement that civilian noncombatants in Gaza be provided with basic staples by the occupying authority."" Juan Cole, Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan, in the Nation, February 3, 2016.</p> <p>You have to have a soft spot in your heart for those upstanding Hamas terrorists. Here they are minding their own business, just trying to kill and terrorize as many Jews as possible by raining thousands of rockets down on civilian populations. But those damned little rockets! Why, they're hardly bigger than roman candles, and it seems no matter how many they launch, they never kill all the Israelis! Thank goodness for truthtellers like Juan Cole!</p> <p>Joseph Massad makes the list with a 114-word sentence inscrutable to any sane homo sapien.</p> <p>5. ""The imperial complicity of the Gay International, including its Arab members, lies in their calling upon all Arabs who refuse the imperial hegemony of the hetero-homo binary to unlearn and unthink the way they desire, and that they learn and think their desires along the lines of the hetero-homo binary, indeed that the way they exist and the way they are, their very ontology, is a form of false consciousness, which they must shed, as the truth of who they are, according to this logic, lies in their adoption of the imperial hetero-homo binary through which they must apprehend themselves and their desires, which will lead, according to the Gay International, to their emancipation."" Joseph Massad, associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University. From an interview in Jadaliyya, March 5, 2013.</p> <p>We don't know what the hell this means, but Massad seems to decry ""the hetero-homo binary"" as hegemonic, especially in its imperial form, and believes that emancipation requires this very ontology. Or something.</p> <p>Juan Cole's fecund imagination runs from ""giant James Bond villains"" to Newt Gingrich with whips and chains.</p> <p>6. ""It wasn't the 21-year-old Michael Enright who drunkenly slashed his New York city cab driver after asking 'Are you Muslim?' It was the Republican National Committee. . . . Newt Gingrich and Rick Lazio may as well have kept Enright in their basements in chains and whipped him into a frenzy as to spew their hatred on the airwaves."" Juan Cole, Richard P. Mitchell Professor of History at the University of Michigan. At his blog Informed Comment, August 25, 2010.</p> <p>Most folks would settle for alien abductions, but back in 2010 Cole couldn't shake imagining violent kidnappings. We're not a shrink, so we won't speculate why, but that March he wrote that being a Middle East expert who is ignored in the public arena is like being an MLB player ready for the World Series who's ""kidnapped,"" taken to a ""secret fight club,"" and made to face a ""giant James Bond villain."" By August, he was fantasizing that Newt and Lazio were into whips and chains. Projection or the heat of summer? You judge.</p> <p>7. ""If Jews can get reparations from Germany, then Palestinians should get reparations from Israel. After all, what the Germans supposedly did to the Jews is what Israel is doing to the people of Palestine."" Susan Slyomovics, professor of anthropology and former director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies (CNES) at UCLA. Spoken during a break at a UCLA conference, via FrontPage Magazine, April 16, 2010.</p> <p>Such a sly Susan! We don't mean her pedestrian analogy that Israelis = Nazis, Palestinians = Holocaust victims. Yawn. Every self-respecting Israel hater knows that. But see how she surreptitiously sneaks in ""supposedly"" just when you didn't expect it? It's a two-fer: casting doubt on the veracity of the Holocaust while smearing Jews as the new Nazis. It's a calculated convolution!</p> <p>Ebrahim Moosa: ""Wahabism is like the Baptists.""</p> <p>8. ""Wahabism is like the Baptists; it's kind of a denomination of sorts that started out in Saudi Arabia."" Ebrahim Moosa, then at Duke University, now Mirza Family Professor of Islamic Thought & Muslim Societies at the University of Note Dame. As reported in the Charlotte Observer, February 25, 2010.</p> <p>The rank disingenuousness of Moosa's claim is seen in a quote from the great historian Bernard Lewis. In illustrating the power that Wahhabi Islam gained during the twentieth century, Lewis said: ""Imagine that the Ku Klux Klan gets total control of the state of Texas. And the Ku Klux Klan has at its disposal all the oil rigs in Texas. And they use this money to set up a well-endowed network of colleges and schools throughout Christendom, peddling their peculiar brand of Christianity. You would then have an approximate equivalent of what has happened in the modern Muslim world.""</p> <p>9. ""I do not find any evidence that makes me agree that Osama bin Laden was behind the attack on the twin trade towers. All we have heard from him was simply a praise and commendation of those who had carried out the operation."" Natana DeLong-Bas, then a lecturer at Boston College and Brandeis University, now associate professor of theology at BC. From a December 21 2006 interview in Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, translated by MEMRI, January 2, 2007.</p> <p>Careful scholars are hesitant to pass judgment on people or events before they've sifted all the evidence, and by late 2006 our intrepid professor hadn't finished her primary source research on the events of over half a decade before. We would love to know what other hypotheses she's studied: was it the Bilderbergers, the Masons, or the Mossad? Hopefully, the long wait for an answer from DeLong-Bas will end soon. Enlighten us, professor!</p> <p>Former PLO spokesman Rashid Khalidi: ""For American Likudniks and their Israeli counterparts ... September 11 was a godsend.""</p> <p>10. ""[The neoconservatives] are convinced that the Middle East is irremediably hostile to both the United States and Israel; and they firmly hold the racist view that Middle Easterners understand only force. For these American Likudniks and their Israeli counterparts, sad to say, the tragedy of September 11 was a godsend: It enabled them to draft the United States to help fight Israel's enemies."" Rashid Khalidi, Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies and then-director of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University. From In These Times, January 27, 2003.</p> <p>Listen, as a former PLO spokesman in the 1980s, Khalidi's job was to be on top of all the intel, so when he says that Likudniks were happy about 9/11, we take him at his word.</p>",4
939414580,SC reprimands Islamabad IG over report on Matiullah Jan kidnapping,2020-08-07 05:39:38,"<p>The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed displeasure at the performance of the Islamabad police and lambasted the capital city police chief for a report his department submitted regarding the abduction of senior journalist Matiullah Jan last month.</p> <p>A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed had taken up the police report as it resumed hearing a contempt of court case against Jan, who was abducted last month and released the same day by men in police uniforms from outside a school in Islamabad.</p> <p>The abduction on July 22 had come just a day before the journalist was supposed to appear before the Supreme Court after it had taken suo motu notice of “contemptuous” tweets against the superior judiciary posted by Jan on his Twitter account.</p> <p>The capital police in its report had conceded that they were still waiting for replies from different departments, the assistance of which they had sought to unearth the journalist’s kidnapping.</p> <p>“But efforts are underway to trace the culprits involved in the incident and in this regard the reports of various departments [are] awaited to carry out further investigations,” stated the 52-page report furnished before the top court on Wednesday by the deputy inspector general (operations) on behalf of Islamabad Inspector General Amir Zulfikar Khan.</p> <p>As IG Khan appeared on the rostrum during the hearing on Thursday, CJP Ahmed inquired why the police had failed to gather information in the case.</p> <p>“What kind of report has been submitted?” the top judge asked while addressing the capital police chief. “IG sahib, what age are you living in [that] you are writing letters like a police babu (clerk)?”</p> <p>CJP Ahmed stressed that time is of crucial importance during an investigation and evidence can be destroyed even if 10 minutes have lapsed after an incident.</p> <p>He told IG Khan that he was apparently “unaware” of how investigations work. “Officers are not there to [only] warm their chairs.”</p> <p>Also expressing dissatisfaction with the performance of the DIG operations, the CJP directed him to “go sit in the department from which you want information”.</p> <p>“You can no longer just write letters. Officers have to move actively,” the top judge said, ordering police to submit a detailed report regarding the abduction.</p> <p>The hearing of the case was adjourned for four weeks.</p> <p>In its last order issued on July 22, the three-judge SC bench had ordered recording by the relevant police station of the statement of Matiullah Jan about the kidnapping incident.</p> <p>Jan was kidnapped from Islamabad in broad daylight on July 21 – a day ahead of his appearance before the Supreme Court in the contempt of court case – but was released around midnight after a hue and cry was raised by journalists, civil society members, human rights organisations and various political parties.</p> <p>In its report, the Islamabad police stated that a five-member special investigation team (SIT) headed by the superintendent police (investigations) was probing the abduction incident, adding that police had soon after the kidnapping of the journalist approached the Ministry of Defence with a request to ascertain his whereabouts from the Intelligence Bureau, Military Intelligence and Inter-Services Intelligence so that the investigation could be concluded on merits.</p> <p>Besides detailing the police communication with various police stations and hospitals to gather information, the report explained that a written request was sent to the director of the Safe City Project for provision of CCTV footage of the place of occurrence, which was still under process.</p> <p>It said the CCTV footage of the alleged kidnappers was also sent to the National Database and Registration Authority on July 24 for matching of the suspects or their particulars, which was still under process. It said verbal directives as well as written orders had also been issued to the SIT members to peruse the FIR and case file to ensure apprehension of the culprits involved in the crime without further delay.</p> <p>The report stated that the police department and SIT members were in close contact with the victim and other relevant departments and every effort would be made to take the case to its logical end.</p>",4

Nnadi, 18, and the wife of a doctor were “arbitrarily separated from the group and killed. The Rector identified the corpse this afternoon,” Kukah said.</p> <p>The bishop said that he had to delay the announcement of Nnadi’s death until his mother could be informed.</p> <p>“We have broken the news to her, and I will be with her,” Kukah said.</p> <p>“The Lord knows best.

He was found by motorists on the side of the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria Express Way, apparently beaten, and was taken to a hospital where he was treated.</p> <p>Nearly 270 seminarians study at Good Shepherd. On the evening of January 8, gunmen, disguised in military camouflage, broke through the fence surrounding the living quarters and began shooting sporadically. They stole laptops and phones before kidnapping the four young men, who are first-year philosophy students, CNA said, citing a report by the Catholic news agency ACI Africa.</p> <p>The seminarians are Pius Kanwai, 19; Peter Umenukor, 23; Stephen Amos, 23; and Michael Nnadi, 18. The report does not say which one is still being held.</p> <p>CNA said Good Shepherd Seminary is located just off the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria Express Way. According to French news agency AFP, the area is “notorious for criminal gangs kidnapping travelers for ransom.”</p> <p>Thomas Heine-Geldern, executive president of ACN International, called the security situation in Nigeria “appalling,” and noted, “Criminal gangs are further exploiting the chaotic situation and making matters still worse.”</p> <p>According to CNA, he compared the situation in Nigeria to that of Iraq prior to the Islamic State’s invasion: “Already at that stage, Christians were being abducted, robbed and murdered because there was no protection by the state. This must not be allowed to happen to the Christians of Nigeria. The government must act now, before it is too late.”</p>",4
