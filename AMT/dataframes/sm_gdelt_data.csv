HISTORY: In the early 1800's a courageous palawa women dived into the freezing sea to rescue a man who had enslaved her as his wife. How was her bravery repaid when she needed a hero?

Warning: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised this article contains images and names of deceased people.

Aboriginal women and girls in lutruwita (Tasmania or Van Diemen’s Land) were superb swimmers and divers.

For eons, the palawa women of lutruwita had productive relationships with the sea and were expert hunters. Scant knowledge remains of these women, yet we can find fleeting glimpses of their aquatic skills.

Wauba Debar of Oyster Bay’s Paredarerme tribe was stolen as a teenager to become, according to Edward Cotton (a Quaker who settled on Tasmania’s East Coast), “a sealer’s slave and paramour”.

Servitude and rescue

Foreign sealers arrived on the Tasmanian coastlines in the late 18th century. The ensuing fur trade nearly destroyed the seal populations of Tasmania in a matter of two decades.

At the same time, life became extremely difficult for the female palawa population.

Slavery was still legal in the British Empire, and so the profitability of the sealing industry was underpinned by the servitude of palawa women.

Sporadic raids known as “gin-raiding” by sealers rendered the coastlines a place of constant danger for female palawa.

Little is known of Wauba Debar other than tales of a daring rescue at sea. Though variations to her story can be found, it most frequently details her long swim and lifesaving efforts in stormy conditions. As one version tells it:

""The boat went under; the two men were poor swimmers, and looked set to drown beneath the mountainous grey waves. Wauba could have left them to drown, and swim ashore on her own. But she didn’t.

First, she pulled her husband under her arm — the man who had first captured her — and dragged him back to shore, more than a kilometre away. Wauba next swam back out to the other man, and brought him in as well. The two sealers coughed and spluttered on the Bicheno beach, but they did not die. Wauba had saved them.""

Death at sea

Sadly, no one was there to rescue Wauba when she needed it. Her demise during a sealing trip, was at the hands of Europeans.

According to a sailor’s account to Cotton, Wauba was one of the “gins” captured to take along on a whaleboat sailing from Hobart to the Straits Islands (Furneaux Group) as “expert hunters, fishers, and divers, as in most barbarous tribes, the slaves of the men”.

The sailing party camped at Wineglass Bay but woke to find the women and dogs had vanished. A group set off to pursue those who’d taken them. In his 1893 account, Cotton speculated in The Mercury newspaper on the likely cause of her death:

Wauba Debar had, I suppose, been captured in like manner … and possibly died of injuries sustained in the capture, which no doubt was not done very tenderly.

The crew interred Wauba at Bicheno, and marked her grave by a slab of wood with details inscribed.

Accounts differ as to when this actually took place. In 1893, elderly Bicheno residents said Wauba was buried 10 years before the date on the headstone, placing her death around 1822.

However, in his diary entry on 24 January 1816, Captain James Kelly described how he hauled up in Waub’s Boat Harbour due to the heavy afternoon swell. Considering the area was already named after her, it can be concluded that Wauba was likely buried before 1816.

Cotton’s report imagined her burial:

""Wauba Debar did not live to be a mother of the tribe of half-bred sealers of the Straits, which became a sort of city or refuge of for bushrangers in aftertime … But she, poor soul was buried decently, perchance reverently, and I suppose other of the captured sisters would be present by the graveside on the shores of that silent nook near the beached boat.""

Here lies Wauba

Rio de Janeiro: Federal prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged American journalist Glenn Greenwald with cybercrimes for his role in bringing to light cellphone messages that have embarrassed prosecutors and tarnished the image of an anti-corruption task force.

In a criminal complaint made public Tuesday, prosecutors in the capital, Brasília, accused Greenwald of being part of a “criminal organisation” that hacked into the cellphones of several prosecutors and other public officials last year.

Greenwald, an ardent critic of Brazil’s far right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is a deeply polarising figure in Brazil, where his work is lionised by leftists and condemned as partisan and heavy-handed by officials in the Bolsonaro administration.

The news organisation Greenwald co-founded, The Intercept Brasil, published articles last year based on the leaked cellphone messages that raised questions about the integrity and the motives of key members of Brazil’s justice system.

The articles cast doubt on the impartiality of a former judge, Sérgio Moro, and of some of the prosecutors who worked on a corruption investigation that landed several powerful political and business figures in prison.

Among those charged in connection with the corruption investigation was a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular leftist whose conviction paved the way for the election of Bolsonaro. Moro was the judge who handled that case, and he is now Bolsonaro’s minister of justice.

The case raises concerns among journalists and advocates for a free press because journalists often rely on confidential or leaked information, sometimes obtained by whistleblowers or hackers.

In fact, Greenwald has been part of a team that won some of the most important prizes in journalism — the George Polk Award and the Pulitzer Prize for public service — for his role in reporting on documents describing government surveillance that were passed on to him by Edward Snowden, a former contractor with the US National Security Agency who later faced espionage charges in connection with the leak.

In a statement, Greenwald called the charges “an obvious attempt to attack a free press in retaliation for the revelations we reported about Moro and the Bolsonaro government.”

Greenwald, who has not been detained, said he intended to continue publishing and cast the case against him as a test of Brazil’s democracy.

“We will not be intimidated by these tyrannical attempts to silence journalists,” he said.

In a 95-page criminal complaint, prosecutors say that The Intercept Brasil did more than merely receive the hacked messages and oversee the publication of newsworthy information.

Citing intercepted messages between Greenwald and the hackers, prosecutors say the journalist played a “clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime.”

For instance, prosecutors contend that Greenwald encouraged the hackers to delete archives that had already been shared with The Intercept Brasil, in order to cover their tracks.

Prosecutors also say that Greenwald was communicating with the hackers while they were actively monitoring private chats on Telegram, a messaging app. The complaint charged six other individuals, including four who were detained last year in connection with the cellphone hacking.

Legal experts and leftist politicians criticized the decision to charge Greenwald, calling the evidence outlined against him thin.

Thiago Bottino, a legal expert at Fundação Getúlio Vargas University in Rio de Janeiro, said prosecutors have not described evidence that suggests Greenwald broke the law.

“There’s nothing in the complaint showing that he helped or guided” the hackers, he said.

Bottino said Brazil’s case law gives journalists broad protections. “You can’t punish a journalist for divulging a document that was obtained through criminal means,” he said.

Gleisi Hoffman, the president of the Workers’ Party, the largest Opposition party, called the charge an abuse of power.

“They want a police state, with more farces, illegalities and arbitrary acts,” she wrote in a message on Twitter.

Greenwald moved to Brazil in 2005 after meeting David Miranda, a Brazilian man he later married and who became a federal congressman ",[],[''],"{'Coronavirus Outbreak', 'Glenn Greenwald', 'Crypto', 'Fp Exclusives', 'Brazil', 'Long Reads', 'Cybercrime', 'Coronavirus', 'Corruption'}",['Updated Date'],2020-01-22 11:30:18+05:30,,,True,2.0,,Federal prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged American journalist Glenn Greenwald with cybercrimes for his role in bringing to light cellphone messages that have embarrassed prosecutors and tarnished the image of an anti-corruption task force,en,https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/favicon.ico?v=6.74,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/americas/glenn-greenwald-brazil-cybercrimes.html,<Element div at 0x7f20a25a7f90>,<Element div at 0x7f20a261de00>,<Element html at 0x7f20a261d4a0>,<Element html at 0x7f20a261ddb0>,{},b84c2848098d470271b419c81adc2a55.1652368004.5548,gdelt_events,12-05-2022,48d6e0ff-4bb0-31bd-4dc1-c88cbe4c7b97,2020_01_01-2020_02_29_gdelt_data.csv

The information was later confirmed to the channel by education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer. The time and location for the ceremony have not yet been determined. It will be organized in consultation with the victim’s family, BFMTV reported.

Reports emerged on Friday night that the teacher was decapitated in the outskirts of Paris. Police chased down and shot to death the main suspect, a Moscow-born Chechen teenager. The victim reportedly taught freedom of speech and showed caricatures depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad to his students.

France’s anti-terrorism state prosecutor, Jean-Francois Ricard, confirmed on Saturday media reports that nine people had been detained as part of the investigation into the beheading of a teacher near Paris. “As of now, nine people have been detained and taken into custody,” Ricard said.

He explained that four detainees were close relatives of the suspect. Two others showed up independently at a local precinct and reported being in contact with the suspect. The other detainees include the family — father and his wife — of a student who complained about the teacher, Ricard said. According to the prosecutor, the father was known to authorities because his half-sister joined the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia) in 2014.

A shopper, who has asked to remain anonymous, said he witnessed the events unfold in Clacton town centre before as many as 11 police officers raced to the scene.

“I was in Wilkinson’s and I then heard and saw people arguing outside before a person ran into the British Heart Foundation shop,” he said.

“Someone with a knife then tried to get into the shop and the door was kicked and smashed in but then the police turned up and made an arrest.

“I was shocked when I saw someone with a blade in the town centre and there was kids around as well.

“I do not think anyone was hurt but there must have been about three police cars and one van and 11 officers.”

Essex Police is now urging eyewitnesses who may have seen the incident at 3.15pm on Tuesday to contact its officers as soon as possible.

When police got to the scene they found a charity shop door had been smashed before two officers were allegedly assaulted while detaining a 40-year-old woman.

She was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession of a knife or bladed article in a public place, a public order offence and criminal damage.

The woman was also detained on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker but has now been released under investigation while the force continues its inquiries.

A spokesman for the force said: “A woman has been arrested in connection with a disturbance in Station Road, Clacton.

“Two officers were allegedly assaulted while detaining a 40-year-old woman from Clacton in connection with the incident.

“She was released under investigation while we continue our inquiries.

MANILA-- President Rodrigo Duterte supports a free press, Malacañang said Monday as it distanced the chief executive from the cyber libel conviction of one of his top critics, Rappler chief Maria Ressa.

Ressa on Monday was found guilty of cyber libel over a 2012 article that linked a businessman to alleged illegal activities. Former Rappler researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. was also convicted in the case.

Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said the Palace expected Duterte's critics to use Ressa's conviction against the chief executive. He said a private individual, not the Duterte administration, initiated the case.

""Naniniwala po siya sa malayang pag-iisip at pananalita at ang paninindigan niya ang taong gobyerno hindi dapat onion-skinned,"" Roque said in a Palace press briefing.

(The President believes in free thinking and speech. He believes that government workers should not be onion-skinned.)

""Suportado po ni Pangulong Duterte ang malayang pananalita at malayang pamamahayag,"" he said.

(The President supports free speech and a free press)

The President's support for freedom of the press can be proven when he backed Davao-based journalist Alexander Adonis over a libel charge and in pushing to decriminalize cyber libel, said Roque.

It can be recalled that Adonis' libel case was filed by late House Speaker Prospero Nograles, a political rival of Duterte during his time as Davao City mayor.

Ressa on Monday said the court's decision was meant to be a ""cautionary tale"" as she urged Filipinos to fight for their rights.

Rappler, which has published stories critical of the Duterte administration, has described cases and acts against it as an attack on press freedom.

""I appeal to you, the journalists in room, the Filipinos who are listening, to protect your rights. We’re meant to be a cautionary tale, we are meant to make you afraid. I appeal again, don’t be afraid,"" Ressa told reporters.

Roque said Ressa's claims had no basis. During his term as Davao City mayor, Duterte never filed a libel case against any journalist, he said.

Businessman Wilfredo Keng accused Rappler of smearing his reputation over a May 2012 article alleging that he allowed former Chief Justice Renato Corona to use an SUV. The same article cited an intelligence report alleging Keng had a shady past.

Rappler argued that the Anti-Cybercrime Law was approved months later, in September 2012. Keng denied the allegations and requested that the article be taken down, which the news website refused to do.",[],"['press freedom', 'Rodrigo Duterte', 'Rappler', 'Maria Ressa', 'journalism', 'Duterte supports free press', 'Palace says after Ressa libel conviction | ABS-CBN News']","{'Maria Ressa', 'Rappler', 'press freedom', 'journalism', 'Rodrigo Duterte'}","['Arianne Merez', 'Abs-Cbn News']",,,,True,2.0,,"President Rodrigo Duterte supports a free press, Malacañang said Monday as it distanced the chief executive from the cyber libel conviction of his top critic Rappler chief Maria Ressa.",en,https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/abs-cbnnews/abscbnmaster/newsapple-icon.png,https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/06/15/20/duterte-supports-free-press-palace-says-after-ressa-libel-conviction,<Element div at 0x7ff362c8dea0>,<Element div at 0x7ff362c9a8b0>,<Element html at 0x7ff362c8d7c0>,<Element html at 0x7ff362c8d900>,{},bcc134c60506535bfe3e3dc28c82ec52.1652273125.9854655,gdelt_events,11-05-2022,55319d7f-98fb-db9b-6128-5dbb60291295,2020_05_01-2020_06_30_gdelt_data.csv

International Press Institute (IPI) is monitoring and documenting media freedom violations committed across the world amid COVID-19 pandemic.

Underlining that ""the free flow of news and reports and information is more essential than ever,"" the IPI has urged all governments to ""recognize the crucial role of independent news media in the coronavirus pandemic and to ensure that emergency measures to tackle the disease are not used as a pretext to censor news and information on- and offline or implement regressive regulations against media freedom.""

IPI Executive Director Barbara Trionfi has also made a statement about the issue. Recognizing that the pandemic has forced governments to implement emergency measures, she has warned that ""the free flow of independent news is more essential than ever"" and added:

""In this age of disinformation, the public needs news that it can trust. It is critical at this stage that governments support the work of independent media, which are crucial allies in the fight against COVID-19.""

Accordingly, she has called on all states to ""ensure that any measures taken to tackle COVID-19 and that infringe on fundamental rights are necessary, proportionate, temporary and limited to solving the immediate health crisis.""

Media freedom violations by region and month

In this context, the IPI has been sharing media freedom violations committed around the world during the pandemic in an infographic by region, month and type of violation. As of 4.47 p.m. today (April 17), the number of media freedom violations committed around the world was as 118:

A police statement said that those arrested at a house in La Horquetta, along the east-west corridor, were also in breach of the Public Health Ordinance Regulations that limit gatherings to no more than five as the country seeks to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

The police said the people were “waiting to collect large sums of money from a pyramid scheme”.

Search

The police exercise was led by Commissioner, Gary Griffith, and in the execution of a search warrant the “police arrested nine persons for being in possession of cash in excess of the prescribed sum.

“A large quantity of money was seized and taken away. The Finance Intelligence Branch of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has been brought into the investigation.”

Griffith said that those involved in the illegal pyramid scheme that the police would seize the money in the scheme and “that would mean that people would lose their hard earned money they invested in these schemes.”

In recent months, persons have complained of being tricked into participating in illegal pyramid schemes.

In Madhya Pradesh, eight people were arrested in Seoni and two in Gwalior for posting objectionable messages on social media and bursting crackers after the Supreme Court verdict, police said. Gwalior jail warden Mahesh Awad was suspended for bursting crackers in Chhaoni area despite a ban on such post-verdict activities by district authorities.

In Ayodhya, devotees flocked to various temples to offer prayers amid tight security arrangements, especially around the disputed site, though some local Muslim leaders claimed that the traditional processions taken out on Prophet Muhammad’s birth anniversary Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi were cancelled on Sunday as a “precaution” and also due to “sadness” over the verdict.

However, authorities asserted that the processions were taken out, though they might have been scaled down.

The government continued to engage religious and spiritual leaders over the Ayodhya issue as National Security Advisor Ajit Doval held a meeting with eminent Hindu and Muslim religious leaders who pledged unstinted support to the government in all steps to maintain peace and order, according to officials.

The meeting was scheduled before the announcement of the verdict date, according to some leaders who participated.

“The leaders resolved to honour the decision of the Supreme Court and appealed to all countrymen to abide by it, emphasizing that the national interest overrides all other considerations.

“They extended their full cooperation to the government in ensuring peace, communal harmony and upholding the rule of law,” according to a joint statement issued after the four-hour meeting at Doval’s residence in Delhi.

Those attending the meeting were alive to the fact that certain anti-national and hostile elements, both within and outside the country, may attempt to exploit the situation to harm our national interest, it said.

Shia cleric Maulana Syed Kalbe Jawad said it is remarkable that the countrymen have ensured peace and tranquillity after the verdict.

“Not a single disturbance was reported from anywhere. We discussed ways to formalise this arrangement so that dialogue can continue between the two communities and differences can be sorted through discussions,” he said.

“We support such initiatives. Time has come that Hindu-Muslim issues should end and everyone contributes to building the country and improve education and eradicate poverty,” the head of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Hasan Chishti shrine, Syed Zainul Abedin Ali Khan, said.

Yoga guru Ramdev said, “Even if there are some questions we will honour the verdict of the Supreme Court to uphold the unity and integrity of the country. This was the most important resolve taken in the meeting.”

“The interaction helped to strengthen communication between top religious leaders to maintain a spirit of amity and brotherhood amongst all communities,” the statement said, adding all the participants reposed full faith in the rule of law and the Constitution.

However, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi again questioned the judgement, saying “if Babri Masjid was illegal why were L K Advani and others being tried in connection with its demolition”.

Addressing a public meeting here on Saturday night, the AIMIM president said, “",[],"['Ayodhya verdict', 'Ayodhya verdict news', 'Ayodhya judgement', 'Ayodhya verdict latest news']",set(),[],,,,True,2.0,,Home Minister Amit Shah has telephoned several chief ministers over the last two days to ensure peace in run up to and after the Supreme Court judgement in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case.,en,https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FE-favicon.png,https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/day-after-ayodhya-verdict-nearly-90-arrested-action-against-thousands-of-posts-doval-meets-religious-leaders/1760391/,<Element div at 0x7f2129ce0f90>,<Element div at 0x7f21291ac0e0>,<Element html at 0x7f2128cbcc70>,<Element html at 0x7f2128cbc0e0>,{},2a0d41111464bd209e96c8cc4a64da98.1652427431.2091937,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,ae46a49e-dee1-5a47-acc3-da78fbd8d47e,2019_11_01-2019_12_31_gdelt_data.csv

He said that one Salisu, had been rescued by his men from kidnappers’ den, bringing to 10 the number of the rescued children, who are now known as, the famous KANO 10′

‘’With the anti-crime Machine of operation ‘Puff Adder’, coupled with community policing engagements, tremendous achievements were recorded.’’

The police boss, who was recently upgraded to the rank of Assistant Inspector-General of Police, also listed his achievements within his six months stay in Kano, to include, the successful rescue of Magajin Gari Daura in Kano, arrest of four notorious cattle rustlers, as well as the recovery of over 1000 cows at the dreaded Falgore Forest, just as the Command also arrested over 500 thugs, known as ‘’Yan Daba’, leading to a peaceful and serene sallah celebrations, the first of its kind for over four decades.",[],[''],set(),[],2019-11-09 22:22:41+01:00,,,True,2.0,,"The Nation Newspaper Kano police nab 3,547 criminal suspects, honour 20 journalists",en,https://nation-media-assets.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12140214/cropped-nation-cropped-l-32x32.jpg,https://thenationonlineng.net/kano-police-nab-3547-criminal-suspects-honour-20-journalists/,<Element div at 0x7f211fc36860>,<Element div at 0x7f211ef20d60>,<Element html at 0x7f211ef205e0>,<Element html at 0x7f211ef201d0>,{},9558683592872358619750566b176812.1652427273.8963497,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,a7a0f33d-c506-1ec0-2f8c-3f59fabdcdd3,2019_11_01-2019_12_31_gdelt_data.csv

Despite big tech’s attempts to combat manipulation, companies that sell clicks, likes and followers on social media are easy to find. A new report by the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence highlights how it’s still cheap and easy to manipulate social media. ( Image source: Ali Asaei/The New York Times)

“A very #MerryChristmas to all,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust enforcer, wrote on Facebook last December. Her post attracted 144 “likes.”

A few months later, as an experiment, researchers paid a company a few dollars to attract attention to her well wishes. In 30 minutes, the post had 100 more likes. The researchers had similar results on a holiday post on Vestager’s Instagram account and on a Christmas tweet from Vera Jourova, the European Union’s justice commissioner.

Companies like Facebook and Twitter are poorly policing automated bots and other methods for manipulating social media platforms, according to a report released on Friday by researchers from the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence. With a small amount of money, the researchers found, virtually anyone can hire a company to get more likes, comments and clicks.

The group, an independent organisation that advises the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, tested the tech companies’ ability to stop paid influence campaigns by turning to 11 Russian and five European companies that sell fake social media engagement. For 300 euros ($330), the researchers bought over 3,500 comments, 25,000 likes, 20,000 views and 5,000 followers, including on posts from prominent politicians like Vestager and Jourova.

After four weeks, about 80 per cent of the fake clicks remained, the researchers said. And virtually all of the accounts that had been used to generate the clicks remained active three weeks after researchers reported them to the companies.

The report spotlights the continuing challenges for Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as they try to combat online disinformation and other forms of online manipulation. After Russia interfered in the United States’ 2016 presidential election, the companies made numerous changes to reduce the spread of online disinformation and foreign interference. In recent months, the platforms have announced takedowns of accounts in China, Saudi Arabia and, most recently, Africa, where Russia was testing new tactics.

But the report also brings renewed attention to an often overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks’ software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions.

in PA custody, with many calling for the end of President Mahmoud Abbas’s 16-year rule.

Nizar Banat, a prominent critic of the PA known for his biting videos on social media, died on Thursday after being arrested by officers in the Palestinian security services.

According to Banat’s family members, they witnessed him being viciously beaten for eight minutes straight before officers dragged him off.

“Get out, get out, Abbas. This is the vote of all the people,” protesters chanted. Green flags emblazoned with white Arabic calligraphy, often associated with the Hamas terror group, dotted the procession.

Invoking one of the best-known slogans of the 2011 Arab revolutions, demonstrators called out: “The people want to topple the regime!”

“Out, out, out, get the dogs of the PA out,” others said.

A crowd of Palestinians — appearing to number in the dozens — also gathered following Friday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem to chant anti-Abbas and pro-Hamas slogans. The site is the third holiest in Islam and it lies on the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site.

“The Palestinian Authority are [Israeli] spies, from the lowest soldier to the president,” the crowd called.

Another few dozen Palestinians gathered at al-Manara Square in downtown Ramallah to condemn the PA for Banat’s death.

Banat, 44, had a Facebook page in which he uploaded videos critical of the Palestinian Authority. He frequently assailed senior officials in Ramallah for alleged corruption and their commitment to security cooperation with Israel.

His political activity brought reprisals. In December, Banat was held for several days under the PA’s controversial 2018 Cybercrimes Law, which allows Palestinians to be charged for “slandering” officials online.

After Abbas canceled planned Palestinian elections in April, Banat, himself a legislative candidate on an independent list, gave an interview harshly critical of the PA president to a Hamas-linked television channel. A few days later, unidentified gunmen fired at his home in Dura, near Hebron.

Banat fled to a hideout in an Israeli-controlled part of Hebron. The West Bank city has been divided since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, which split the city into Palestinian and Israel-administered areas.

On Thursday morning, members of the PA security services raided the house where he was staying. According to his family, the officers stripped Banat, sprayed pepper gas in his eyes, before “viciously beating him” and dragging him away. Two hours later, his family learned that Banat was dead.

The PA has said it will conduct a full investigation with representatives from the family and human rights groups.

His death sparked widespread outrage among Palestinians, leading rare protests to break out in Ramallah on Thursday. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through the streets, calling for the end of Abbas’s 16-year rule. They were met by police wielding batons and firing tear gas canisters.

Banat’s funeral was held in southern Hebron. Thousands packed into the mosque, with many others gathered outside. Little social distancing was in evidence, even though many Palestinians in the West Bank have yet to be vaccinated.

The funeral was led by the Hamas-linked journalist Alaa al-Rimawi, who has himself been detained by both Israel and the PA security services on several occasions.

“Peace be upon you, Nizar. Peace be upon you. You are the teacher, the instructor,” al-Rimawi said, gesturing at Banat’s body.

Over the years, evidence has mounted of SARS units unlawfully arresting and detaining young people across the country. That evidence includes accounts of kidnapping, extrajudicial executions, stealing property and extorting money.

Since 2016, Amnesty International has documented at least 82 cases of torture, ill-treatment and extrajudicial executions by SARS. In a report published in June 2020, Amnesty found that:

[T]orture is a routine and systemic part of police investigation in SARS; that many SARS stations use designated ‘torture chambers’ – special interrogation rooms commonly used for torturing suspects.

In spite of all the evidence, the Nigerian government has failed to take action.

#EndSARS protests

On 8 October, young people took to the streets of Lagos to protest against SARS, injustice and police brutality. Protesters called on the Nigerian government to disband SARS, reform the country’s police force, and bring corrupt officers to justice. The protests were sparked by a graphic video of a man being shot by police in Lagos, as well as young Nigerians sharing their experiences of police brutality at the hands of SARS across social media. Following this, protesters gathered in cities across Nigeria, as well as the UK, the US and Canada.

In Nigeria, reports of police harassing, arresting and brutalising protesters came to a head when a young Nigerian, Jimoh Isiaq was shot and killed by police at an #EndSARS protest on 10 October – though officers deny the allegation. Seven others were injured.

Dissolution of SARS

On 11 October, the office of the President announced that SARS was officially dissolved with immediate effect. This was followed by a press conference with Nigeria’s inspector general of police, Mohammed Adamu.

Read on...

While the dissolution of SARS may appear to be a victory for protesters, all SARS officers will be redeployed to other units, and a “new policing arrangement” is being created to replace the unit. Many social media users expressed cynicism that corrupt SARS officers will be held to account.

Amnesty International Nigeria made a statement in response to Adamu’s announcement, saying that disbanding SARS:

falls short of demands for accountability and justice for abuses committed by the unit and the police in general. Disbanding SARS must be supported by addressing the underlying issues that has allowed impunity to thrive.

On-the-ground reports and accounts of police kidnapping and attacking young protesters with live ammunition, teargas, and water cannons in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja emerged hours after the announcement.

Peaceful protests continue across Nigeria and worldwide, calling for the release of arrested protesters, justice for the victims of police brutality, the establishment of an independent body to oversee the investigation and the prosecution of officers who have been accused of human rights violations. In addition, campaigners are pushing for psychological examinations and retraining for former SARS officers before the police force redeploys them.

While the current situation in Nigeria is unclear, one thing is for certain: the Nigerian people’s fight for justice is far from over.

Officers say the video (linked) shows 20-year-old Ter'on Forrester taking out an AR-15 pistol with a scope, and pointing it at passing cars and buses on a busy roadway Saturday (26). The safety was off. Two marked police cars were nearby at the time.

The video was captioned ""bored af"" and ""got 40 fa dey a--"" followed by the laughing with tears emoji face. The video was taken from a backyard on 15th Avenue South in St. Petersburg. The area is near the border with Gulfport, which is 49th Street South.

Wednesday, Gulfport detectives, Pinellas deputies and ATF agents arrested Forrester and also issued him a Risk Protection Order, confiscating the AR-15 and ammunition. He didn't own the pistol but it wasn't stolen either. It was purchased legally. Forrester is in the Pinellas County Jail on a $10,000 bond.

Environment Minister Neno Dimov, who was facing charges of mismanagement that resulted in the ongoing water shortage in the town of Pernik, submitted his resignation on January 10, which was accepted by Prime Minister Boiko Borissov.

The prosecutor’s office said that Dimov authorised the pumping of water from the Stoudena reservoir over a period spanning from the beginning of 2018 until November 2019, despite warnings that water levels were approaching critically low levels.

Dimov was routinely kept informed of the water levels in the reservoir, but authorised the pumping of larger quantities than requested by industrial consumers, case prosecutor Angel Kunev told reporters. The evidence collected pointed towards intentional mismanagement, he said.

“This was not a single act by the minister. The damages are enormous, with 97 000 people facing water restrictions,” he said.

Dimov was questioned at his office on the morning of January 9 by Special Prosecutor’s Office staff and Interior Ministry officers. In the early afternoon, he was taken from the building and placed in a Prosecutor’s Office van to be taken away for further questioning.

He was later detained overnight for 24 hours and faced a further 72 hours under arrest once he and his legal counsel were informed of the charges, Kunev said.

Even before prosecutors pressed charges, Dimov had submitted his resignation, with the Cabinet media office saying in a brief statement that it has been accepted.

Dimov was a nominee of the minority partner in the coalition, the ultra-nationalist United Patriots. Earlier in the day, Defence Minister Krassimir Karakachanov, one of the United Patriots co-leaders, described the events on January 9 as a “public execution”.

Karakachanov told public broadcaster Bulgarian National Television that Dimov’s arrest was “unnecessary” and said that he did not believe that the now-former minister was responsible for the Pernik water shortage.

Case prosecutor Kunev said that at the time Dimov left his office for further questioning on January 9 he was not detained and could freely speak to the media.

The previous edition of the march, in 2019, attracted around 20,000 people, according to the organizers. Despite the ever-present Covid-19 pandemic, they expected a greater presence at this year’s parade, which began at 3 p.m. local time, 10 a.m. in Brazil, due to intensified polarization politics in the country.

Over the past two years, Orbán has fostered an escalation in attacks on LGBT rights, including banning transgender people from changing their names and legally defining a family as consisting only of a male father. and a female mother.

In the latest offensive, the government, which controls more than two-thirds of the Hungarian parliament, passed a law prohibiting “the making available to minors under the age of 18 of pornography or depiction of sexuality for their own purposes, or involving any deviation from the gender identity the person was born with, or gender shift and homosexuality ”.

In March, Orbán had already sued a television station for showing an LGBT family in an advertisement. The government also banned the circulation of a fairy tale book that included same-sex relationships.

Another ingredient that helped ferment Saturday’s protest is next year’s election, in which the Tory PM is to face the candidate from a united front of the opposition, made up of six major political parties. all political horizons.

The march takes place precisely in the fields of one of the main creators of this united opposition front, the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, 46 years old. Anti-Orbán acronyms have yet to choose their candidate, but the young environmentalist is singled out as one of the favorites.

It was also because of the elections that the current Prime Minister began to raise anti-LGBT rhetoric – according to Hungarian analysts, as part of the usual populist tactic of creating a common enemy and presenting himself as the strong man capable of fighting it.

Orbán’s main target for the past decade has been immigrants, but the prime minister turned his battery against non-heterosexual minorities after the refugee crisis ended. In the case of the law passed in June, human rights activists claim that in addition to harming education and culture, the government has created a false association between homosexuality and pedophilia.

“This Hungarian law is a disgrace”, declared the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen at the end of June.

Last week, the Commission launched legal action against the measure, which has been the subject of protests from progressives in Europe and Hungary. One of the consequences of the process may be the suspension of the transfer of funds to the country, but the process usually takes several years.

For his part, the Prime Minister doubled the bet against his detractors, announcing that he will organize a referendum on the text approved in Parliament. As in other consultations already organized by the Hungarian government, the referendum contains biased questions, according to opponents.

One, for example, asks voters if “content that may affect sexual orientation should be shown to children without restrictions”.

UNDERSTANDING THE CASE

Who is the Prime Minister of Hungary?

Viktor Orbán, 58, studied English, law and political science. He became leader of the Fidesz party in 1993 and made it migrate from its liberal line to a conservative, nationalist and populist platform.

Orbán was Prime Minister for the first time from 1998 to 2002. He returned to government in 2010 and, with parliamentary scrutiny, changed electoral laws which allowed his party to gain more seats with fewer votes. . He was re-elected in 2014 and 2018.

Has Orbán’s political agenda always been anti-LGBT?

No. The conservative politician pursues the populist strategy of creating enemies against whom he presents himself as a leader with firm hands capable of defending the population.

Since his return to power in 2010, Communists, immigrants, the European Union, Jewish capitalists (notably Hungarian-American George Soros) and, for the past three years, LGBT people have already been chosen as primary targets.

Igboho said this during an interview with Saturday PUNCH on Friday, while reacting to the face-off between him and security agents around the Guru Maharaji bus stop along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.

The Yoruba rights activist, who has been in the news for serving a quit notice on Fulani herdsmen in some parts of the South-West, said he was never invited before they attempted to arrest him.

The OPC chieftain, who spoke with one of our correspondents, said he and other members of Yoruba local security and pressure groups were with the Yoruba activist on his way to see Adebanjo in Lagos when they were accosted by a security team comprising men of the Nigerian Army, police, and DSS.

Adesina said, “Although we were caught unawares, we were not unprepared for any eventuality. Sunday Igboho was to meet our father, Ayo Adebanjo, in Lagos, so we got prepared and set out. I can’t really tell the exact time.

“Our journey was smooth until we were stopped and the security men began to harass the entourage asking, ‘Where is the criminal?’ We were in disbelief. When we realised that it was Igboho Osha that they were on the lookout for, there was an exchange of words and the place turned rowdy.

“We called to question their ground for wanting to arrest him. For us, the law enforcement agents were wrong to have put on a show. On what ground would the arrest of Sunday Igboho be, while the killer herders who are wielding dangerous weapons, kidnapping, killing, maiming and extorting our fathers, mothers and sisters still walk free?

“We are happy that although there was tension at the scene, we were allowed to go without any problem. No gunshot was fired, nobody got hurt and we later proceeded on our journey.”

This was part of discussions at a two-day training workshop organized for lawyers, civil society organizations and critical stakeholders in Anambra State on the Anti-Torture Act and the draft rules that guide its implementation.

With the theme, “Building the capacity of CSOs on the Anti-Torture Act (2017)”, was organized by the Access to Justice and the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Programme (RoLAC) through International Federation of Female Lawyers (FIDA).

In a lead presentation, a resource person, a former Director, Nigerian Laws Reforms Commission, Mrs. Didi Odigie-Bedell while reviewing the domestic and international legislation which prohibits or criminalizes the use of torture, identified societal silence as a major factor driving the spate of torture.

She said a better understanding of the Anti-Torture act will not only prevent the Police and other line agencies from engaging or abetting torture but also empower the stakeholders in the criminal justice system to effectively play their roles in guaranteeing the safety of persons reporting torture.

“A major innovation in the draft implementation rules that looks at Victims Support and Witnesses Protection. This aspect ensures collaboration between the government and the CSOs to provide protection for witnesses and ensure that testifying and presentation of evidence is done in a manner that supports witness protection. The rules have also given the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the CSOs roles in this regard which include rendering legal assistance in the investigation, monitoring, and filing of complaints about persons who suffer torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatments or punishment,” she posited.

The Chairperson, Anambra State Chapter of the International Federation of Female Lawyers (FIDA), Professor Ogugua Ikpeze who dwelt on general Review of VAPP Act and the reforms it introduces, said it focuses on eradicating violence and entrenching peace in homes and not destroying homes.

According to her, “The issue of violence has been broadened under this Act to include other aspects that are not originally covered by the Criminal Justice Law. For instance, rape is no longer seen as when you have carnal knowledge of another person forcefully. Also, the initial requirements needed to substantiate a rape case has been liberalized and not only evidence of a ruptured hymen or torn underwear. This is one of the numerous aspects that the Act covers.”

The workshop also did an expose on the challenges of providing free legal services to the poor and how stakeholders can source support in pursuit of such pro bono services.

Some participants at the event including Prince Chris Azor, Chairman, Anambra Civil Society Network and Gab Okpalaeze of the Media, said with the knowledge garnered, they are now better equipped to undertake their roles in curbing incidences of torture and violence.

Police discovered a bizarre 'driving licence' when they stopped a dangerous driver.

Officers are believed to have attempted to stop the vehicle in London, before pursuing the suspect out of the capital. And according to reports, the driver only stopped when he ran out of petrol.

A pink driving licence, which states that the holder is an 'official member of the Legoland Driving School', was found in a car following a chase. Cops also found a large amount of cannabis in the vehicle and the driver was arrested, a spokesman for Kent Police's Road Policing Unit confirmed.

Sharing an image of the 'licence' and the drugs on Twitter, @KentPoliceRoads tweeted: ""No, the #LegoLand license was not the reason for the drivers dangerous driving, the large amount of cannabis was.

""The driver was pursued from #Bexley to #IsleOfSheppey & arrested for a multitude of offences last week by #RPU1, @KentPoliceSwale, @MPSRTPC & @NPASLondon.""

The National Police Air Service London helped track the suspect vehicle with a helicopter during the early hours of Monday February 28.

(AP) - A sanity hearing was delayed for a Louisiana man who told authorities God instructed him to end his life before a fiery crash that killed another driver.

Jordan was indicted on a second-degree murder charge in a 90 mph (145 kph) crash in July 2019 that killed Stephanie Payne, 51. Jordan’s arrest report stated he’d told officers God instructed him to kill himself, so he purposefully accelerated his truck to hit another vehicle.

The hearing for Jack Jordan, 19, was scheduled for Thursday, The Advocate reported. District Judge Bonnie Jackson agreed to push the court date back to April 23 because one of two doctors tasked with examining Jordan’s sanity asked for more time to complete his evaluation.

Last month, he was deemed competent to stand trial after initially being deemed incompetent, the newspaper reported.

Jordan pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.

IDLIB — Suhail Zubair, a pseudonym, is one of many journalists who have fled the city of al-Bab the northeastern countryside of Aleppo, fearing for his safety and that of his family. He was threatened by the Syrian opposition factions loyal to Turkey after he reported on prisons run by these groups in the cities of al-Rai and Afrin, where thousands of detainees are held.

Zubair told Al-Monitor that he has reported for several local and Arab satellite stations. But constant threats over his investigative journalism pushed him to flee with his family a year ago to Turkey. There, he paid some $60,000 to get them smuggled to Sweden.

“It all began in al-Bab when I obtained private information from former prisoners in al-Rai prison about the [Turkish-backed] factions detaining dozens of Kurdish women of various ethnicities from the city of Afrin. The women have been in prison since the factions took over the city in 2018. They are not even tried and are subject to gang rapes by prison officials, some even tortured to death,” Zubair said.

Zubair said, “I met with the families of 10 Kurdish female prisoners from Afrin. These families showed me pictures of the imprisoned women, some of whom were minors. The families told me that when the factions took control of Afrin, these imprisoned girls were barely 10 years old. Their fate remains unknown.”

He went on, “These women and girls were subjected to the worst treatment. I was able to speak to some of former prisoners, who told me they were kidnapped from their homes one year after the factions took control of Afrin. The factions began kidnapping Kurdish women and some were held in these prisons. The factions blackmailed their families and forced relatives to pay high ransoms, often reaching $30,000, in exchange for releasing them. These prisoners asked me not to name them in my documentary, for fear of being kidnapped again and killed by the factions.”

Zubair added, “I also spoke with sources from the Syrian armed opposition, who told me that the factions prevent international human rights organizations from entering the women’s cells or communicating with them, as they fear being held accountable and tried in international courts if the women reveal to these organizations the abusive practices and grave violations.”

Zubair said he was threatened three times by one faction leader who said he would booby trap his car and house if he continued his investigation.

“I tried to conduct an investigative report on these women and their alleged crimes,"" he said. ""I was threatened by a faction leader who said he would blow up my car, kill my family, kidnap and stab my children and rape my wife if I continued.”

“I also noticed that some days I was followed by masked people wherever I went to do my job. My journalist friends advised me to flee with my family because I was dealing with real criminals who do and will carry out their threats. My fellow journalist Hussein Khattab, who was a correspondent for the Turkish channel TRT Arabic, was assassinated in December 2020 by unknown persons on a motorcycle,” he said.

Alaa Haitham is a pseudonym for a TV journalist who once worked in the northwest Syrian city of Idlib, which is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and fled months ago with her husband and two children to France. She told Al-Monitor about the hardships female journalists face in northwest Syria.

Those in control of the area “are extremist jihadists and former fighters of the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra who threaten journalistic work, especially work that criticizes their policies,” she said.

“I received death threats because I was preparing a documentary film about the difficulties female journalists face ... as well as the imprisonment, death threats and rape at the hands of HTS,” Haitham said.

“I dedicated the introduction of my documentary to Nour al-Shilo, a journalist and activist who had been detained for months and reportedly faced execution. But she was eventually released last year. HTS threatened to kidnap and kill me, which prompted my husband to look for a smuggler we paid some $60,000 to get us to France,” she added.

Journalists from the cities of Idlib and al-Bab told Al-Monitor that every week, more media workers are fleeing Syria because of the restrictions and threats they face.

They added that the Syrian opposition factions’ prisons hold dozens of journalists and activists who have been stuck there for years.

Easton police said Travis K. Brooks, 35, of Trappe, Maryland, was arrested Tuesday on charges of second-degree rape, third- and fourth-degree sex offence, abuse of a vulnerable adult and second-degree assault.

Authorities began an investigation in April after Easton police were called to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center for a theft report, news outlets reported. Officers were told that a patient had money stolen from her wallet while having a procedure done. Investigators identified Brooks as a suspect and subsequently learned he had been taking photos of patients’ credit cards, according to police.

After executing several search warrants, detectives found a video that police say was recorded by Brooks in December 2019 and shows him sexually assaulting a patient who was unconscious. Detectives were able to identify the victim and confirm that Brooks carried out and recorded the assault, police said.

In addition to the sexual offences, Brooks is also charged with misdemeanour drug possession and several counts of theft.

Brooks, who has a long arrest record and was charged with assault in July 2019 in a separate case, was being held without bond on the sex charges pending a hearing Wednesday afternoon. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney who could comment on the charges.

Joe La Fountaine alleges violation of his right to free speech and wrongful termination

A former top administrator of Portland Public Schools is suing the district and four of its key administrators for $5.5 million for allegedly violating his right to free speech and wrongful termination.

Joe La Fountaine was the regional superintendent of high schools in the 2018-19 school year for Oregon's largest school district, which teaches about 49,000 students.

The suit claims he was fired because of his conservative social media posts.

La Fountaine's suit said that he received an email on June 15 from PPS administrator Jonathan Garcia that included copies of political quotes and memes that were posted on La Fountaine's social media page. The district objected to these posts, the suit claims.

The suit said ""These 'memes' consisted of a quote attributed to George Washington about second amendment rights, a quote attributed to JFK, and a meme expressing the sentiment that women with conservative political views are disbelieved by the media more often than women with liberal political views.""

All of the content was ""objectively inoffensive,"" reflected ""mainstream political views"" and was protected speech, the suit said. It did not impact La Fountaine's ability to do his job, the suit holds.

Administrators asked him to retire or resign. La Fountaine refused.

Then on June 17, Portland Public Schools cut off his district email and deactivated the electronic key to his office, the suit said. He was subsequently terminated.

Part of the damages, $500,000, is for wrongful termination.

When asked about the suit, a district spokesperson said via email ""PPS did not enter into a contract with Mr. La Fountaine beyond June 30, 2020. He retired from the PERS system at the end of 2019 and continued as a paid employee of PPS through the end of his contract and the end of the academic year, ending June 30, 2020.""

The district did not comment specifically on the allegations brought by La Fountaine.

The suit claims that La Fountaine's agreement with the district said he would continue in his role as regional superintendent of high schools until at least July 2020 and he was discussing with administrators about extending that through July of 2021.

La Fountaine bought a house in Portland, based on his understanding that his employment would go through July 2021, the suit says.

In June 2020, he was told his employment would only last through December 2020 and eventually was terminated in mid-June after the discussion of his social media posts, the suit said.

La Fountaine is a seasoned school administrator, with years of experience as a principal and district administrator in Oregon. From 1983 to 1992, he taught eighth grade American history and other subjects at Winston Middle School, in Winston, Ore., which is south of Roseburg.

He was principal at several schools around the state including Ontario High School and Portland's Sitton Elementary School. In 2014 he took a central office administration job in Portland Public Schools.",[],"['topics: Education', 'socialTag: Fountaine', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'Portland Public Schools', 'Internet meme', 'Oregon', 'States of the United States', 'Cities in the United States', 'Andrew Fountaine', 'entities: principal and district administrator', 'district spokesperson', 'Oregon', 'social media posts', 'Portland', 'Winston', 'Joe La Fountaine', 'school administrator', 'conservative social media posts', 'social media page', 'Winston Middle School', 'Jonathan Garcia', 'Sitton Elementary School', 'regional superintendent', 'largest school district', 'Portland Public Schools', 'administrator', 'Ontario High School', '']",set(),['Teresa Carson'],2020-10-02 01:00:00-07:00,,,True,2.0,,"Former administrator sues Portland Public Schools for \$5.5 million, Local News, Portland local News, Breaking News alerts for Portland city.",en,/images/favicon.ico,https://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/482812-389360-former-administrator-sues-portland-public-schools-for-55-million,<Element div at 0x7f40c72fd1d0>,<Element div at 0x7f40cc8e7770>,<Element html at 0x7f40bdda4770>,<Element html at 0x7f40bdda4450>,{},fddd25fba6cbc3cc4252c5cbef28750b.1652184488.5894933,gdelt_events,10-05-2022,fde1956b-d8c5-c3be-d8c5-15c86ba88ab0,2020_09_01-2020_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

freedom fighter certificates of 52 persons, including Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's fugitive killer Risaldar (suspended) Moslehuddin Khan, Minister for Liberation War Affairs AKM Mozammel Huq said on Sunday.

A gazette notification was issued on January 5 cancelling their certificates, Huq told IANS, adding that the notification is available on the ministry's website.

The Minister also said that within the next December 16, they will finalise the list of members of the 'Razakars', 'Al-Badr', 'Al-Shams', the auxiliary forces of Pakistan Army then.

The Liberation War Affairs ministry had issued a notification as per the recommendation of 70th meeting of National Freedom Fighters Council, under the National Freedom Fighters Council Act 2002, more than seven months after the publication of the new list of freedom fighters.

As per the notification, Khan, one of the fugitive killers of Bangabandhu, is among the 52 people who were stripped of titles.

On June 7 last year, the Bangladesh government issued a notification cancelling the certificates of 1,181 freedom fighters following the recommendation of the 66th meeting of the National Freedom Fighters Council.

On June 2, 2020, it formally included 1,256 more people in the list of freedom fighters after scrutinising around 150,000 applications following the decision of the meeting.

Moslehuddin Khan, a key conspirator convicted for assassinating Bangladesh's founding father most of his family members, reportedly died in his dwelling at North 24 Parganas of India on January 10 last year.

According to the media, he was living there with the family of Parosh Chandra Adhikari for long disguising his identity. He was going under the name 'Samir Kumar Dutta' alias 'Dutta Doctor'.

Talking with Mamata Adhikari of the family, media confirmed that he was living with them till his death.

(Beirut) – The death of the writer and poet Baktash Abtin in custody is emblematic of the dire situation Iranian authorities have created for imprisoned critics of the government, Human Rights Watch said today. Iranian officials should conduct transparent and impartial investigations into recent reported deaths in custody due to alleged negligence, hold those responsible accountable, and release all wrongfully detained dissidents.

On January 8, 2022, the Iranian Writers’ Association (IWA) reported that Abtin, 47, who was battling a second Covid-19 infection since being detained in September 2020, had died in a hospital in Tehran. Abtin, imprisoned on abusive national security charges, was put into an induced coma the first week of January after prison authorities allegedly delayed transferring him to an outside medical facility when he showed symptoms. The authorities pressured Abtin’s family to bury him more quickly than they had planned, the IWA reported.

“Iran’s justice officials bear responsibility for the death of Baktish Abtin, who should never have been imprisoned for his work,” said Tara Sepehri Far, senior Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “All prior government promises about investigating detention abuses ring hollow when prisoners continue to die in the face of the authorities’ utter lack of care for their lives.”

Abtin is the second prisoner in Iran to die since the start of 2022. On January 1, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) reported that Kian Adelpour died under “ambiguous circumstances” after going on a hunger strike in Ahwaz prison to protest his case. The activists Sasan Nikfans and Behnam Mahjoobi died in prison in 2020. Their families allege that prison authorities delayed or restricted their access to health care.

The IWA stated that Abtin did not receive medical care for four days in prison before being transferred to Taleghani hospital. His family was also kept unaware of his medical condition for several days. Since the beginning of his sentence, Abtin had unsuccessfully applied for medical leave due to his underlying health issues that Covid-19 could have exacerbated. He was previously hospitalized in April 2021, when he contracted the coronavirus for the first time.

On May 15, 2019, Branch 28 of Tehran’s Revolutionary Court sentenced Abtin and his codefendants Keyvan Bajan and Reza Khandan Mahabadi to six years in prison on politically motivated charges of “assembly and collusion to act against national security” and “propaganda against the state” that stemmed from Abtin’s leadership of the IWA and their advocacy against state censorship. The authorities summoned them to begin their sentences in September 2020, even as an earlier wave of the pandemic was ravaging Iranian prisons.

During the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, Iranian authorities reportedly released or temporarily freed 850,000 prisoners, but dozens of peaceful dissidents have been excluded from those measures.

Human Rights Watch reiterates the call made in a joint statement on January 7 urging Iranian authorities to release those unjustly detained and not to summon political prisoners to serve their sentences while the conditions inside Evin prison and other facilities remain unsafe.

“We support the more than a dozen Iranian political prisoners who recently called the government and judiciary responsible for creating the conditions that put the lives of imprisoned dissidents at grave risk,” Sepehri Far said.

Differing interpretations of the validity of a warrantless arrest compound the problem.

MANILA, Philippines – The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has refused to release public school teacher Ronnel Mas, who was arrested for posting about a P50-million reward to “kill” President Rodrigo Duterte, his lawyers reported on Friday, May 15.

The lawyers argue there is no valid ground to detain Mas.

NBI agents are waiting for a release order for Mas, who is being detained at the NBI headquarters in Manila, his lawyer Dino de Leon of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) told Rappler. As of writing, De Leon is still trying to get his client freed.

The problem is being compounded by confusion on how to interpret the validity of a warrantless arrest.

Mas was arrested May 11 by NBI Dagupan agents without a warrant. The complaint that was eventually filed was for inciting to sedition.

In a 7-page resolution, Assistant State Prosecutor Jeanette Dacpano of the Department of Justice (DOJ) said the warrantless arrest was invalid.

“It is undeniable that the arrest of Ronnel Mas made by the NBI-Dagupan operative does not fall within the ambit of warrantless arrest contemplated by law,” said Dacpano.

As Dacpano explained, warrantless arrests are only valid if:

1) the person is caught in the act

2) there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed

3) a prisoner is escaping from jail

Continuous crime?

In the past, the DOJ had upheld the warrantless arrest of Rodel Jayme, the Bikoy video uploader, saying that the online posts count as a continuing crime.

In legal jusrisprudence, continuing crime usually refers to crimes of rebellion or kidnapping, which would allow the police to “catch in the act” and arrest without a warrant a rebel on the loose, even though the said rebel was not doing an unlawful act at the moment of arrest.

But Dacpano said: “Inciting to sedition is not a continuous crime for which the offender may be arrested without a warrant duly issued by the proper authority.”

“Moreover, the arresting officer, at the time of the arrest, had no personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has indeed committed the crime,” said Dacpano.

De Leon said that with an invalid warrantless arrest, “unless the NBI has any other valid court order to continue with the detention of Mr Mas, we submit that the NBI’s continued deprivation of his liberty has no valid legal and factual basis.”

Invalid or valid?

However, Dacpano eventually said in her ruling that “the defect of Mas’ warrantless arrest was ultimately cured when Mas extra-judicially admitted to the media that he indeed personally posted the provocative text in his own Twitter account.”

Dacpano said the admission made to media inside the NBI headquarters means it did not amount to a custodial investigation. In a custodial investigation, a person has rights, including the right to have a lawyer.

Dacpano’s ruling, however, did not tackle an earlier admission, made inside the car of the NBI agents immediately after his arrest, where the agents pressed him without the presence of counsel.

With all these, is the warrantless arrest valid or invalid?

In an earlier text to Rappler, Prosecutor General Ben Malcontento said the warrantless arrest was valid. Malcontento approved Dacpano’s resolution.

Dacpano found probable cause to charge Mas with inciting to sedition, but charges will be filed next week.

Without a charge, and with an invalid warrantless arrest, FLAG’s De Leon maintains there is no legal ground to keep Mas detained.

Asked why Mas cannot be charged sooner given the limitations of the lockdown on courts, Malcontento said: “Courts are open for bail purposes.” – Rappler.com",[],[''],"{'2022 PH presidential race', 'Special coverages', 'UAAP Basketball', '2022 Philippine Elections', '2022 PH vice presidential race', 'United States', '2022 PH local races', 'Election fact checks', 'SEA Games', 'Twitter', 'web series', 'NBA playoffs', 'UAAP Volleyball', 'Hollywood movies', 'Russia-Ukraine crisis'}","['Lian Buan', 'Lian Buan Covers Justice', 'Corruption For Rappler.

THE family of a delivery driver who was stabbed to death while working in Finsbury Park have called on detectives to name his suspected killer, nearly eight months on.

Taki Eddine Boudhane – who was known as Taki – died on the corner of Lennox Road and Charteris Road on January 3.

The Deliveroo and UberEats worker was in an altercation with the driver of a white VW Caddy-type van shortly before his death.

The van driver is believed to have followed Taki’s motorbike before confronting him and stabbing him in the chest. Police have identified a suspect who they say boarded a plane to Austria the morning after Taki’s death. But officers have been reluctant to release a name or description of the person they are hunting.

Mr Boudhane’s brother, Islam, told the Tribune this week: “It’s been really difficult, nothing has changed for us.

“He [the suspect] is hopping countries, and it doesn’t feel like anything is happening.

“I think they should give more information out to the public. We don’t know why they aren’t doing that. As a family we have been asking them to issue a description and a name since January.

“You see it in other cases where the police are hunting someone, so why not this one? I think it would definitely help.

“We can understand a delay with the pandemic and everything around that, but that has quietened down now. People are flying in and out of the country again, and it feels like nothing is happening.

“Our lives have been ruined. Nothing could make me happy now.”

Detectives hunting Taki’s killer say “significant progress” has been made in the months since he died, and said they could not release the suspect’s name due to fears it would harm the investigation.

Flowers left close to the spot where Mr Boudhane was killed

The Met confirmed this week that homicide detectives were still actively investigating the case, led by Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, but could not confirm whether European law enforcement agencies were involved.

Thirty-year-old Taki’s body was taken back to Algeria for burial earlier this year. Speaking to the Tribune at the scene of her son’s death, Taki’s mother Saida said he came to London to have a safer life.

“He came here to do a very honourable job. It’s not a job that’s meant to be dangerous,” she added. “Taki is gone. We can never bring him back. I’m a mother. I don’t want this to happen to another mother.

“He didn’t kill one person, he killed a family. We want to make sure this is just not another murder. I will never bring my son back, I will have to deal with this for the rest of my life.”

Police in Finsbury Park after the killing of Mr Boudhane

In a statement released this week, DCI John said: “We have made significant progress since Taki was killed at the beginning of the year, including speaking to many witnesses who were at the scene that night.

The state’s high court issued a stay in the case of Ray Cromartie, 52, who was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday evening for the 1994 shooting death of convenience store clerk Richard Slysz.

The stay was issued so that the court could determine whether the execution order was properly filed earlier this month, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.

The Georgia attorney general’s office said the current execution order was void and that it would seek a new order, the newspaper reported.

Attorney general office officials could not be reached by Reuters for comment outside of normal operating hours.

Cromartie was accused of borrowing a gun from his cousin and then went to the Madison Street Deli in Thomasville and shot and wounded store clerk Dan Wilson in the face on April 7, 1994.

Three days later, Cromartie and his friends Corey Clark and Thaddeus Lucas went to Junior Food Store in Thomasville, Georgia, to steal beer. When the pair entered the store, Cromartie shot Slysz twice in the head, killing him, prosecutors said.

Cromartie and Clark tried to open the cash register but were unsuccessful. Cromartie then took two 12-packs of Budweiser beer and the men fled, according to court papers.

Cromartie was arrested three days later. During the trial, Clark and Lucas testified against Cromartie. Both men pleaded guilty to lesser charges, court papers showed.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Cromartie’s request for an appeal in his case in December 2018.

Cromartie would have been the 18th inmate in the United States and the third inmate in Georgia to be executed in 2019, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",[],"['US', 'GEORGIA', 'EXECUTION', 'Fundamental Rights / Civil Liberties', 'Crime / Law / Justice', 'Crime', 'Human Rights / Civil Rights', 'Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions', 'Pictures', 'Murder / Suspected Murder', 'Picture Available', 'Georgia (US State)']",set(),['Brendan O Brien'],2019-10-30 11:10:12+00:00,,,True,2.0,,"The Supreme Court of Georgia halted on Wednesday the execution of a man who was convicted of shooting and killing a convenience store clerk while stealing two 12-packs of beer with two other men more than 20 years ago, local media reported.",en,/article/_next/static/images/favicon-9d0324f5d28e80e699a4e92617ab6f30.ico,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-execution-idUSKBN1X9190,<Element div at 0x7ef6ab7c2630>,<Element div at 0x7ef6ab7bfe00>,<Element html at 0x7ef6ab7d9ef0>,<Element html at 0x7ef6ab7d9450>,{},0be220a797dfb0995ed5164e6b09ff21.1652461761.7017827,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,b27075f8-729f-9887-eeac-87c87687fbd0,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Though the AUMF was originally granted to permit military action in Iraq, the 268-to-161 vote to repeal it on Thursday represents a growing bipartisan sentiment that the AUMF had been used to justify conflicts that had not existed when it was first issued. The Biden White House has expressed support for repealing both the 2002 AUMF and the 2001 AUMF passed shortly after 9/11 to combat terrorism, though the former may be easier to revoke because the Iraq War officially ended several years ago. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated that he intends to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote this year.

The Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) from a group of Republican-led states, writes the Washington Post. The states asserted that Congress’s 2017 removal of the individual mandate that required Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty should render the entire act unconstitutional because the individual mandate was posited as the source of the law’s constitutionality by the Supreme Court in 2012. The justices ruled 7-2 that the states seeking to overturn the ACA did not have standing as “there is no possible government action that is causally connected to the plaintiffs’ injury — the costs of purchasing health insurance.” Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, dissented, claiming that the impact of the ACA on states as employers would be more than enough for the plaintiff states to have standing.

The Supreme Court also issued a decision in favor of two corporations accused of links to child slavery in the Ivory Coast, according to the New York Times. The case, Nestle v. Doe, was a lawsuit brought by six Mali citizens against the companies Nestlé USA and Cargill. Writing for the majority, Justice Thomas said the companies’ activities in the United States were not sufficiently related to the alleged abuses to be subject to suit under the Alien Tort Statute. The decision is the latest in a series of rulings setting strict limitations on federal lawsuits based on foreign human rights abuses. Justice Alito wrote a lone dissent.

Hong Kong police arrested five editors and executives of a pro-democracy newspaper on charges of colluding with foreign powers, reports the Associated Press. The arrests are the result of a sweeping national security law aimed at cracking down on the city’s freedoms. Authorities said the newspaper, Apple Daily, had played a “crucial part” in a conspiracy by foreign powers to impose sanctions on China and Hong Kong. A letter to readers by the publication said, “We will continue to persist as Hongkongers and live up to the expectations so that we have no regrets to our readers and the times we are in.”

KANNUR: A Muslim League worker was killed by a gang in the violence that followed the conclusion of polling at Kuthuparamba, Kannur district on Tuesday.

According to the police, Paral Mansoor (21) of Pullukkara, near Kuthuparamba, was hacked to death by the gang, who allegedly belonged to the CPM. Mansoor’s brother Muhasin (27) also was admitted to the hospital with serious injuries.

IUML Kannur district committee said the attack was organized by CPM.



The Kuthuparamba police have taken a CPM worker into custody in connection with the murder. The police said they have got the details of 11 more persons involved in the attack.



The incident took place around 8.30 pm on Tuesday, as a gang of alleged CPM workers barged into the house of Mansoor after creating a scare in the area by hurling bombs into the house. As they attacked Muhasin, his brother Mansoor tried to stop them and the assailants hacked Mansoor also.

The attack followed an argument between the Muslim League and CPM workers in the area in connection with the polling. The brothers were taken initially to Thalasserry Indira Gandhi Hospital and from there to a private hospital at Kozhikode. The death of Mansoor was confirmed around 1 am on Wednesday.



Police took Shinoj, a CPM worker who is the neighbor of Mansoor, into custody in connection with the murder. The mortal remains of Mansoor will be brought to his house at Kuthuparamba after the post mortem.



In protest against the murder of League worker Mansoor, UDF has called for a dawn to dusk hartal in the Kuthuparamba constituency.



""Another mother has lost her son due to CPM violence. CPM has killed UDF cadre, Mansoor. Fear and frustration of losing power are evident in these attacks. Instead of protecting the killers from the law, CPM and LDF Govt should ensure strict punishment for the killers,"" said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, in a tweet.",[],"['Muslim league worker', 'Violence', 'kerala polls violence', 'Kerala assembly election', 'CPM', 'Kannur']","{'Muslim league worker', 'Violence', 'Kerala assembly election', 'Coronavirus', 'kerala polls violence', 'CPM', 'Kannur'}",[],2021-04-07 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,The attack was considered as the result of an argument between Muslim League and CPM workers in the area in connection with the polling.,en,https://images.newindianexpress.com/images/FrontEnd/images/favicon.ico,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2021/apr/07/kerala-poll-day-violence-muslim-league-worker-hacked-to-death-in-kannur-allegedly-by-cpm-workers-2286949.html,<Element div at 0x7f61a137b130>,<Element div at 0x7f61a13afcc0>,<Element html at 0x7f61a1362a90>,<Element html at 0x7f61a13580e0>,{},0d475bba8d636abbba776b74cc5b34cf.1652096389.1769447,gdelt_events,09-05-2022,b6d1f171-c8ce-7c0c-7103-21a73ec27f63,2021_03_01-2021_04_30_gdelt_data.csv

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 7 — Two former Twitter employees and a third man were charged in San Francisco Federal Court yesterday with spying on Twitter users critical of the Saudi royal family, the US Justice Department announced.

The two Saudi citizens and one US citizen allegedly worked together to unmask the ownership details behind dissident Twitter accounts on behalf of the government in Riyadh and the royal family, the department said.

According to a court filing, they were guided by an unnamed Saudi official who worked for someone prosecutors designated “Royal Family Member-1,” which The Washington Post reported was Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Those charged were Twitter employees Ali Alzabarah and Ahmad Abouammo, along with Ahmed Almutairi, a marketing official with ties to the royal family.

“The criminal complaint unsealed today alleges that Saudi agents mined Twitter’s internal systems for personal information about known Saudi critics and thousands of other Twitter users,” said US Attorney David Anderson.

“US law protects US companies from such an unlawful foreign intrusion. We will not allow US companies or US technology to become tools of foreign repression in violation of US law,” he said in a statement.

The lawsuit comes as US-Saudi relations continue to suffer strains over the brutal, Riyadh-sanctioned murder one year ago of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who wrote for, among others, The Washington Post.

A critic of Crown Prince Mohammed, Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

According to the Post, US intelligence has concluded that the prince himself was closely linked to the murder. — AFP",[],"['twitter', 'spying', 'saudi', 'mohammed bin salman']",{'COVID-19'},[],2019-11-07 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 7 — Two former Twitter employees and a third man were charged in San Francisco Federal Court yesterday with spying on Twitter users critical of the Saudi royal family, the US Justice Department announced.

She also shares a name with her country's president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who since taking power in 2014 has arrested more than 60,000 people for political reasons, according to Human Rights Watch.

On September 20, Egyptians across the country defied the threat of political backlash to take to the streets in protest. They demonstrated against the el-Sissi regime and, above all, the president's extravagant spending; he has constructed lavish palaces and villas, while much of the population is mired in poverty. They were the first anti-government protests in six years, and the reaction was predictable: thousands of arrests and a regime that continues to crack down on its citizenry.

'Beaten' for her phone password

Esraa Abdel-Fattah was arrested in the capital, Cairo, on October 12. According to her lawyer, Mohamed Salah, she was taken to an undisclosed location where she was forced to stand blindfolded against a wall for several hours and beaten. The security authorities apparently wanted her to give them the password to her smartphone, Salah wrote on Twitter a day after her disappearance.

Egyptian authorities have stepped up the security presence amid anti-government protests

Meanwhile, a court in Cairo has sentenced Abdel-Fattah to 15 days in prison for ""spreading false information"" and ""involvement with a terrorist association."" The activist has been on hunger strike for several days now, to protest against the sentence and the torture she has experienced in prison.

'Her life is in danger'

Famous author Alaa al-Aswany commented on her arrest in his weekly column for DW Arabic. ""Esraa Abdel-Fattah's only crime is that she defends the right of Egyptians to justice and freedom,"" he wrote. ""Her life is in danger. Were she to die, el-Sissi would be personally responsible.""

The organization Reporters Without Borders estimates that at least 16 journalists have been arrested in Egypt. It is calling for Abdel-Fattah's immediate release, and for an end to the persecution of media professionals critical of the government.

Egypt expert Amr Magdi works with Human Rights Watch in Berlin. He says that, before el-Sissi came to power, prominent individuals enjoyed a certain amount of immunity. ""They weren't abducted or imprisoned, let alone tortured. This course of action against a prominent person like Esraa Abdel-Fattah shows how paranoid the system has become,"" Magdi says.

Important element of Egyptian civil society

He explains that Abdel-Fattah put her political activism on hold about two years ago. In 2011, she came to public attention as part of the April 6 Movement that played a leading role in the Arab Spring in Egypt, calling on Facebook for demonstrations. She continued to be politically active after the revolution; she founded a nongovernmental organization, and was an important element of Egyptian civil society.

Thousands of Egyptians are tweeting, using the hashtag that translates to ""Where is Esraa Abdel-Fattah"" in an attempt to draw attention to living conditions in Egypt. ""While people are being abducted on the street and from their homes, while citizens' cellphones are being searched, and while foreigners are being treated as spies, the regime will not see any tourism or investment,"" one young woman tweeted.

The case is also causing a stir at an international level. David Schenker, a leading US diplomat specializing in the Middle East, described Egypt's treatment of the prominent journalist and activist as outrageous. Reuters news agency reported that he had discussed her case with the Egyptian ambassador. Schenker added that Egypt still had a long way to go in terms of respect for human rights.

A few days ago, Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, also addressed the topic in Cairo. After a meeting with President el-Sissi, he said it was in Egypt's interest for people there to be able to rely on certain legal standards and ""breathe the air of freedom."" He commented that Esraa Abdel-Fattah and thousands of others were being denied this very freedom.

The study of 2,000 adults found the ideal evening at home would also include a beer or glass of wine, a relaxing bubble bath, and 27 minutes browsing Instagram.

And national treasures, Holly Willoughby, David Attenborough and Joanna Lumley are the top three celebs Brits would would spend their night in with.

Cheesecake would be the dessert of choice and three episodes of the latest ‘must-watch’ boxset would also be binged - all before being tucked up in bed by 10.56pm.

Commissioned by Iceland, the research also found 73 per cent of adults favour a Friday evening at home rather than a night out – no matter what time of year it is.

In fact, 62 per cent consider Friday night to be the highlight of their week, with a fifth admitting they start looking forward to it as early as Monday.

A spokesman for Iceland said: “There are few things nicer than a Friday night in – you’ve had a long, busy week, rushing round, getting things done and now you’ve got the weekend ahead of you.

“All you need to do is get home, change into your comfy clothes, choose something nice to eat and drink, and then relax – hopefully without a care in the world.

“And everyone is in a good mood because it’s Friday – perfect.”

The study also revealed other ingredients for the ideal evening at home include listening to music (33 per cent), reading a book (31 per cent) and playing video games (11 per cent).

Drinking cocktails (11 per cent), having a massage (11 per cent), and having a natter on the phone to family (10 per cent) also feature on itineraries.

The optimum living room also would have a comfortable sofa (30 per cent), a big flat-screen TV (13 per cent) and a wood fire (10 per cent).

For 69 per cent of those polled, nights in are so sacred they’ve even made an excuse to avoid having to go out.

The number one fib is ‘I don’t feel very well’ (57 per cent) followed by ‘I’m having to work late’ (25 per cent) and ‘my kids are ill’ (13 per cent).

The Iceland study carried out through OnePoll also revealed the most iconic living rooms of all-time – and Monica's apartment in Friends came top.

The ‘neat freak’ fought off competition from Del and Rodney’s flat in Only Fools and Horses, and the Simpsons’ living room at Evergreen Terrace.

A spokesman for Iceland added: “The nation has no doubt spent countless Friday nights in their living rooms enjoying episodes of Friends, Only Fools and Horses or The Simpsons.

“So it’s very fitting they would finish so high in our poll to find out the most iconic living rooms of all-time.”",[],[''],set(),['Sun Reporter'],2020-09-18 09:05:11+00:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/icon-e1459786005667.png?strip=all&w=32,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/12703381/brits-favourite-night-in-curry-tv/,<Element div at 0x7f4034bdca90>,<Element div at 0x7f40356857c0>,<Element html at 0x7f40364cb770>,<Element html at 0x7f40364cb8b0>,{},e3b86d26b8dd2caab9b8d1b660641002.1652182151.9133527,gdelt_events,10-05-2022,61bcc60e-634d-ba2e-53a0-f37210f97bf9,2020_09_01-2020_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

US journalist charged by Myanmar with terrorism, sedition

Frontier Myanmar reporter Danny Fenster was arrested in May as he headed home to see his family

Myanmar's junta has charged a US journalist detained since May with sedition and terrorism, which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, his lawyer said today.

The military has squeezed the press since taking power in a February coup, arresting dozens of journalists critical of its crackdown on dissent that has killed over 1,200 people, according to a local monitoring group.

Danny Fenster, who had been working for local outlet Frontier Myanmar for around a year, was arrested as he was heading home to see his family in May and has been held in Yangon's Insein Prison since.

The 37-year-old is already on trial for allegedly encouraging dissent against the military, unlawful association and breaching immigration law.

The additional charges under Myanmar's anti-terror and sedition laws open Fenster up to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The trial is scheduled to begin on Nov. 16.

""He has become quite thin,"" Fenster's lawyer Than Zaw Aung said. The American was ""disappointed"" at being hit with the new charges, which were filed on Tuesday, the lawyer added.

Danny's case has become emblematic of the utter contempt Myanmar's military has for independent media

They come days after former US diplomat and hostage negotiator Bill Richardson met junta chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyidaw, handing the increasingly isolated junta some rare publicity.

Richardson has previously negotiated the release of prisoners and US servicemen in North Korea, Cuba, Iraq and Sudan and has recently sought to free US-affiliated inmates in Venezuela.

The former UN ambassador said he was hopeful he had brokered a deal for a resumption of visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross to prisons, which have been filled with political prisoners.

Richardson, declining to give further details, said the US State Department asked him not to raise Fenster's case during his visit.

""Danny's case has become emblematic of the utter contempt Myanmar's military has for independent media,"" Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International's deputy regional director for research, said in a statement.

""These harsh new charges only further highlight the clumsy attempt to prosecute an independent journalist who should be freed immediately and unconditionally so he can be reunited with his family and friends.""

Fenster is believed to have contracted Covid-19 during his detention, family members said during a conference call with American journalists in August.

He last spoke with US consular officials by phone on Oct. 31, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday, adding Washington remained ""deeply concerned over his continued detention"".

The military has tightened control over the flow of information, throttling internet access and revoking the licences of local media outlets

The Southeast Asian country has been mired in chaos since the military ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, with the junta trying to crush widespread democracy protests and stamp out dissent.

The military has tightened control over the flow of information, throttling internet access and revoking the licences of local media outlets.

Several journalists critical of the military government were among those released last month in a junta amnesty to mark a Buddhist festival.

More than 100 journalists have been arrested since the putsch, according to Reporting ASEAN, a monitoring group. It says 31 are still in detention.

The coup snuffed out the country's short-lived experiment with democracy, with civilian leader Suu Kyi now facing a raft of charges in a junta court that could see her jailed for decades.

Citing a supposed bomb threat (apparently contrived by regime agents on board the plane), Belarus air traffic control ordered the Boeing 737 to turn around and land in Minsk.

On the ground, regime police entered the plane and abducted opposition journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. Belarus’s state media reports that the hijacking/abduction was carried out on the personal orders of President Alexander Lukashenko.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken (rightly) called the operation a “shocking act.”

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, tweeted (correctly) that it was “outrageous and illegal” and that Protasevich “must be released immediately.” That’s hard to disagree with.

Unfortunately, neither the US, nor several EU regimes, have any business grandstanding on the matter. They’ve pulled the same kind of stunt before, at least as recently as eight years ago.

In July 2013, Bolivian President Evo Morales’s plane left Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport en route back to La Paz. The Dassault Falcon 900 FAB-001 was forced to land in Austria after being refused entry into French, Italian, Portuguese, and Italian airspace.

Why? Because while in Russia, Morales had indicated (in an interview with Russian state media) his willingness to offer asylum to American whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The US government, in the words of Jen Psaki (currently White House Press Secretary, but back then a State Department spokesperson) had “been in contact with a range of countries across the world who had any chance of having Mr. Snowden land or even transit through their countries.”

Austrian authorities claim they searched the plane for Snowden. Bolivian authorities say that Morales refused to allow a search. But either way there’s little doubt that several EU regimes, at the request (implicit or explicit) of the US regime, colluded to force a plane — and not just any old regular plane, but a diplomatically protected plane — to land in an effort to help abduct a political refugee.

No, I’m not defending Lukashenko. He’s not very defensible. I hope that he can be pressured into freeing Protasevich and Sapega alive and unharmed.

But if the “leaders of the free world” didn’t act exactly like Lukashenko whenever it suits them or serves their interests, they’d be in a much better position to mobilize global action to achieve that outcome.

UPDATED 2.03.2021 The journalists did not appear in court on 28 February . The security representative told the court that the 4 journalists will be released as part of a deal with the de facto government. The YJS and the IFJ call for the immediate release of the journalists and remind that media professionals should not be used as bargaining chips between warrying parties.

Journalists Abdul Khaleq Amran, Tawfiq Al-Mansouri, Harith Hamid, and Akram Al-Walidi were arrested together with five other journalists on 9 June 2015 at the Hotel Dream Castle in Sana’a. According to media reports, their arrest was motivated by their reporting on human rights violations committed by Houthi forces.

Since then, they have been subjected to a series of crimes, including disappearance, physical and psychological torture, denial of the right to be visited and the right to have access to medical care. These actions break all international conventions and norms on the treatment of prisoners.

On 21 February 2019, the IFJ sent a letter to UN General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, and the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, urging them to “bring their full authority and the powerful array of legal tools at their disposal to demand the immediate and non-negotiable release of them”.

Two months later, on 30 April 2019, the IFJ and YJS reitetated demands for their immediate and condemned the use of the journalists as bargaining chips in the country's ongoing conflict.

On 16 April 2020, a Houthi court sentenced them to death. The IFJ sent another letter to the UN General Secretary urging him to support moves to protect their lives and demand the release of all journalists jailed in the country.

The YJS said in a statement that “the suffering of our fellow journalists is not limited to depriving them of their freedom and torturing them psychologically and physically, but it also extends to their families who are living in a tragic situation, awaiting the return of their relatives”.

IFJ General Secretary, Anthony Bellanger, said: “These death sentences are an absolute blow to press freedom in a country where working as a journalist is an everyday challenge. Together with YJS we urge the Court of Appeal to fully reject the death sentence and set our colleagues free.”

The latest report of media freedom violations by YJS documented 112 cases of violations of media and journalists’ rights in 2020. The Houthi group was responsible for 29.5% of this total.

According to the IFJ's latest statistics, Yemen ranks seventh in the world for having the most journalists imprisoned.

Bao Choy, a former producer with Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK, was found guilty last month of ""knowingly making a false statement"" to access number plate ownership records -- a conviction that was decried by media groups as an assault on public interest journalism.

On Thursday, Choy and five colleagues won the Chinese-language documentary award at the annual Human Rights Press Awards for their work ""Who Owns the Truth?"".

The awards recognise human rights reporting across Asia and have been running for 25 years.

Judges praised the RTHK documentary for ""chasing the smallest clues, interrogating the powerful without fear or favour"", and described the 23-minute documentary as ""an investigative reporting classic"".

The July 2019 attack in the district of Yuen Long by a gang of men armed with clubs -- and the police's failure to respond quickly enough -- was a turning point in the huge and often violent pro-democracy protests that year, further hammering public trust in the police force and city leaders.

RTHK used footage from witnesses and security cameras -- as well as number plate searches and interviews -- to piece together events.

It uncovered new details about the alleged attackers, some of whom have links to politically influential rural committees that support Beijing.

It also said that police failed to respond to the build-up of stick-wielding men, ferried into the district by specific vehicles that evening hours before the attack.

Police have rejected any accusation their officers failed the public that night and senior officers have since sought to recast the ambush as an evenly matched melee between two opposing sides.

Hong Kong maintains a publicly accessible licence plate database long used by journalists, including pro-Beijing news outlets.

But authorities introduced a rule change that meant journalists were no longer allowed to make searches.

Choy, 37, faced up to six months in jail but was ultimately fined HK$6,000 ($770). She plans to appeal her conviction.

Beijing has made no secret of its desire to see Hong Kong's critical media tamed and the city has slid down press freedom rankings in recent years.

RTHK has found itself a government target. Authorities have ordered an overhaul of the broadcaster, including the recent appointment of a career civil servant as its new head who has since pulled multiple shows for ""one-sided views"" and ""inaccuracies"".

RTHK suspended Choy after her November arrest and did not contribute to her legal defence.

It also announced it had withdrawn from all press award entries but many award organisations, including HRPA, declined to accept the withdrawal.

""During the transition period, RTHK decided not to nominate programmes for awards, would also withdraw their entries from those competitions, and would not accept related awards,"" a spokesperson said Thursday.

The station's Twitter account -- which has developed an irreverent outspokenness under the new management -- hinted at disquiet within the newsroom.

""#RTHK picks up more prizes, despite management's best efforts,"" the account wrote. ""Bao Choy and Nabela Qoser, who've both been given their marching orders, are recognised in this year's Human Rights Press Awards.""

Earlier this week, RTHK fired reporter Nabela Qoser who had become famous for her aggressive questioning of officials at press conferences.

A report she helped produced on the policing of protests won a commendation in the same category as Choy.",[],"['convicted', 'hong', 'kong', 'journalist', 'wins', 'award', 'investigation']",set(),[],2021-05-06 03:42:31-04:00,,,True,2.0,,Convicted Hong Kong journalist wins award for investigation,en,https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png,https://www.ibtimes.com/convicted-hong-kong-journalist-wins-award-investigation-3194018,<Element div at 0x7f1ba8f7ef40>,<Element div at 0x7f1ba8f59720>,<Element html at 0x7f1ba8f59450>,<Element html at 0x7f1ba8f593b0>,{},50c6926331c061d9e898c24f126f04d2.1652026163.3329093,gdelt_events,08-05-2022,075527a0-9cad-bf46-e987-a7b1e57846d1,2021_05_01-2021_06_30_gdelt_data.csv

IYD, first observed in 1999, puts emphasis on the need to engage the youth in politics, economy and society, a task which largely belongs to the government.

Led by Youth Co:Lab Philippines, this year’s IYD had 16 sessions with this theme: “Together, let us turn the world we have into the world we want.”

Discussions were held during the one-week event and findings were sorted that reflected the Filipino youth’s concerns.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said 49.5 percent of 235 young Filipinos, who took part in the consultations, remained “hopeful” of good governance.

It said that 36.5 percent was optimistic about recovery from the COVID pandemic while 28.4 percent said it valued education more.

The report also said the young were “worried” about climate emergency (49.5%), conflicts and disasters (45.5%), and access to primary health care and social services (30%).

“Throughout the consultation the youth have been curious about how better leaders could be elected to govern the country,” UNDP told INQUIRER.net.

“[They] are looking forward to better management in the local and national levels of government in the years to come,” it said.

For University of the Philippines’ (UP) Department of Political Science Prof. Ma. Ela Atienza, the youth are “generally more idealistic and more hopeful and they place higher expectations on themselves, other people and government to do better.”

In the Philippines, the Youth in Nation-Building Act that was enacted in 1995 defined the Filipino youth as those between the ages of 15 and 30.

The Philippine Statistics Authority previously said that in 2020, the projected population of those with ages 15 to 29 was 29.79 million, 15 to 19 was 10.21 million, 20 to 24 was 10.05 million and 25 to 29 was 9.54 million.

On eligible voters among the Filipino youth, the Commission on Elections said there are 3.04 million voters aged 18 to 19, 7.98 million voters aged 20 to 24, and 7.37 million voters aged 25 to 29.

For UP’s Department of Political Science Prof. Jean Franco, the desire for good governance was possibly roused by the government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis.

As of Sept. 26 (Sunday), the Philippines has 2.49 million COVID-19 cases – 161,447 active cases, 2.29 million recoveries, and 37,405 deaths.

The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) also said that the Philippines is one of the nations in the world that have not started physical classes since the beginning of the COVID pandemic.

Gov’t attacks

In 2016, the United Nations said the government has a responsibility to solve problems concerning young individuals— lack of work, low representation in political processes, and being excluded from society.

UNDP said that the young believe that the government has a great role in achieving “the world we want.”

In the Philippines, however, those who fight for people’s rights, especially the young, have become victims of the government’s war on critics.

According to rights group Karapatan, six of 715 political prisoners in the country were arrested when they were still minors while 18 young Filipinos were victims of extrajudicial killings targeting activists from July 2016 to June 2021.

In 2019, for instance, 22-year-old rights worker Ryan Hubilla was killed in Sorsogon province, where the military was deployed for counterinsurgency by President Rodrigo Duterte’s Memorandum Order No. 32.

Atienza said progressive youth are definitely more critical of the current administration and its performance in many areas.

“They have been at the receiving end of attacks, both verbal and physical, from agents and enablers of the present administration,” she said.

Young’s voice

Dr. Selva Ramachandran, resident representative of UNDP, said people respond to present-day challenges with “innovative approaches and fresh ideas, building bridges and creating the world they want.”

“The youth are best prepared now than any other time in the past to engage with the world and influence sustainable development,” he said.

“They are leading development for themselves, their communities, and their societies.

Cardinal Pell was convicted behind closed doors on five child sexual abuse charges in December 2018. He was acquitted by the High Court this year.

Suppression orders in place because of a pending second trial, which was later dropped, meant his conviction could not be reported until months later.

But a number of media outlets published information about the conviction of a high-profile Australian and referenced court orders.

Victoria's Director of Public Prosecutions Kerri Judd QC has charged 11 corporations and 19 individuals with contempt over the publications.

Each are accused of breaching a suppression order over the whole of the proceedings, and of sub judice contempt in respect of the then-pending second trial.

There are 100 charges in total, with each accused facing between two and eight charges over newspaper, online, television and radio reports, and editorials.

Barrister Matt Collins QC, who is representing all 30 accused, told Victoria's Supreme Court on Tuesday multiple trials are likely to be sought.

""At present it appears to us there are 13 separate controversies and on the face of it, it would do an injustice to have journalists for rival news organisations face trial at the same time,"" he said on Tuesday.

All would be heard by a judge alone.

Dr Collins said his clients were anxious for the case to be resolved.

""They've had these matters hanging over their heads for far too long,"" he said.

Justice John Dixon agreed the case, which has been going for more than a year, was dragging on too long.

He noted it seemed the parties hadn't agreed to any facts in the case, noting the prosecution argument that Cardinal Pell was a high-profile Australian hadn't been accepted by the defence.

But Dr Collins said while that seemed an uncontroversial statement, the status of Cardinal Pell's profile in Darwin, Perth or anywhere else outside Victoria was irrelevant to the case.

He said given the serious contempt charges being faced, they couldn't admit such a bold allegation.

But prosecution lawyer Lisa De Ferrari SC said the suppression orders over the case applied Australia-wide, so it was relevant.

If convicted, organisations face significant fines while individuals face up to five years in prison.

Dr Collins previously described the charges as ""serious as it gets"" and said guilty findings could have a ""chilling effect"" on open justice.

Justice Dixon listed November 9 for the first trial, but flagged the possibility it could happen sooner.

A jury in Davenport found Tre Henderson guilty Thursday of first-degree murder and other crimes. The 28-year-old will be sentenced April 1 to life in prison without possibility of parole.

Prosecutors said little Ja'Shawn Bussell had 17 broken ribs, damage to a number of internal organs and bruises from the top of his head to his ankles after Henderson beat him on April 22, 2018. Ja'Shawn vomited several times over the next four days before being taken to a hospital, court records say. He was taken off life support and died May 1, the records say.

Henderson and the boy's mother, Jacqueline Rambert, are both from Chicago and were living in a Davenport apartment when the boy was assaulted, authorities have said. Davenport is about 160 miles (258 kilometers) west of Chicago.

In addition to the murder counts, both were charged with child endangerment for failing to seek prompt medical attention for the boy.

Rambert, 26, pleaded guilty last month to child endangerment resulting in death and child endangerment-multiple acts and agreed to testify against Henderson. She said on the witness stand that Henderson had beaten her son more than once.

The wife of the deceased said, ""My husband was not a fighting type. He played with everyone. People have been asking me if I suspect anyone but I tell them nobody. I don't suspect anyone because you would not see him fighting. I want the government to do the right thing to those who killed my husband.

""Such a person should face proper discipline. Government should get them arrested and prosecute them because he was killed when he started making his fortune. This is the time we should be enjoying his sweat. He must not die in vain. They should for God's sake get his killers. He sold his car to execute a project in Ogbomoso and he promised to buy another car for me and my children. He promised me many things but they didn't allow him to fulfil any of the promises.

""Government and individuals should do something for his children to support their education and also complete his site, so as for us to move into the house.

""The project was a concert. He was still struggling to get some sponsors for his concert in Ibadan but they didn't allow him to do it.""

Speaking at the visit, Babalola who prayed for the family of the deceased, said journalists in the state had given the state government three days to arrest the killer of the journalist.

He said, ""We are here to offer our condolences to the family of one of us who was killed on Saturday. We feel your pains and we pray that such a thing won't happen again. The handsome man was killed at his prime when he was supposed to care for his children.

The drama occurred amid competing demonstrations, angry online rhetoric and accusations of intimidation, much of it related to the protests that have roiled India for months. While many Sikh-Canadian activists have come out in support of the farmers and decried the controversial strong-arm tactics New Delhi has used against them, other Indian Canadians, many of them Hindu, have made a point of voicing support recently for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Article content The Indian high commission in Ottawa lodged a protest about the most recent altercation, warning such incidents could harm the “warm and friendly relations” between the two countries. “I have been here for 35 years and I’ve never seen anything like this in Canada,” said rally participant Azad Kaushik, president of the National Alliance of Indo-Canadians. “This has shocked me, to tell you the truth.” More On This Topic Canadian Sikhs worry for families in India as farm protests turn violent 'People are frightened': Sikh activists chilled by arrest of men brandishing loaded gun at anti-India protest But a spokesman for a major Sikh group blamed tensions on the pro-Modi media and demonstrations themselves. He called the rallies an attempt to divert attention from an oppressive government, while creating the false narrative of religious strife in Canada.

Article content “It’s not a Hindu-vs-Sikh issue, it really isn’t,” said Jaskaran Sandhu of the World Sikh Organization. “This is an attempt to kind of provoke the (Sikh) community. It’s a very nefarious attempt to change the issue and make it a communal issue.” Motives aside, the opposing factions clashed just over a week ago on the streets of Brampton, Ont., west of Toronto, when Sikh counter-protesters met a pro-India car rally. In an incident captured on video, a man resembling Jodvhir Singh Dhaliwal, who’s married to the sister of the New Democrat leader’s wife, strides toward an India supporter, shoving the man in the chest and sending him toppling backwards onto the pavement. The victim got up almost immediately and did not appear injured.

Article content The shoving is under investigation by Peel Region Police, a spokeswoman said Tuesday, though no charges had been laid. Lawyer Harval Bassi, a criminal-law specialist representing Dhaliwal, said his client had no comment on the affair. No one should be confronted by violence for expressing their point of view The NDP leader’s office would not address the episode directly, but said Jagmeet Singh and the party have been clear that “everyone, everywhere should have the right to protest peacefully.” “No one should be confronted by violence for expressing their point of view,” said a party statement.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP)

A second Canadian citizen held for more than two years on spying charges, in apparent retaliation for Canada’s arrest of a senior executive of the telecoms giant Huawei, went on trial in Beijing on Monday. Diplomats from 26 countries including France tried to attend the trial, but Chinese police refused them entry to the courthouse.

The trial on Monday of analyst and former diplomat Michael Kovrig in Beijing follows an initial hearing in the case of entrepreneur Michael Spavor in the northeastern city of Dandong on Friday.

Canadian diplomats have been refused access to the trials. A notice on the website of the Beijing No. 2 People's Intermediate Court explains that ""because the case involves state secrets, the court conducted a closed hearing against Canadian defendant Kang Mingkai (Kovrig's Chinese name) for spying,"" adding that it would ""select a time"" to pass a verdict.

In spite of the warning, diplomats and journalists showed up to seek information and show support.

Outside Beijing's No. 2 Intermediate Court, Jim Nickel, the Canadian Embassy’s deputy chief of mission, told journalists he had been told the trial had begun, but was barred from entry in what he said was a violation of China's international and bilateral treaty obligations.

‘It’s troubling’: Outside a #Beijing court, diplomats from 26 countries call out support for #Canada & the #UnitedStates to get Michael Kovrig & Michael Spavor freed. They were denied access to Kovrig’s trial now underway, despite international agreements. ⁦@NBCNews⁩ pic.twitter.com/T8ynN3XWqr — Janis Mackey Frayer (@janisfrayer) March 22, 2021

“Michael Kovrig has been detained for more than two years now. He's been arbitrarily detained and now we see that the court process itself is not transparent,"" Nickel told reporters. “We're very troubled by this but we thank those who have come out from the embassies here in Beijing and the international support that we've had for Michael, for Canada and the call that many of us are making for their immediate release.""

Nickel said 26 countries had sent representatives to show their support, including France, the US, the UK, Australia and many European nations. It wasn't clear how long the trial would last or when a verdict would be announced.

Irresponsible remarks

At a daily afternoon news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, “the Canadian side made irresponsible remarks on China’s law-based handling of the cases of Canadian citizens with some other countries’ diplomats in China, which is a gross interference in China’s judicial sovereignty.""

China's handling of the cases is “beyond reproach,"" Hua said, while calling Canada hypocritical because it also reserves the right to try cases involving state secrets behind closed doors.

Leverage

However Beijing is likely to use the Kovrig and Spavor cases as leverage to obtain the release of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei founder, the millionaire Ren Zhengfei, who was arrested at the request of the US at the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia, in December 2018. The two Canadians were detained in China just days later.

Meng is sought by the US on fraud charges related to the telecom giant’s dealings with Iran, which is under American financial sanctions.

Days before the Kovrig trial, a spokesperson for China's embassy to Canada said that the ""Meng Wanzhou incident is plotted by the United States with the purpose to bring down Chinese high tech enterprises. Ms. Meng Wanzhou has been arbitrarily detained by the Canadian government at the request of the US side for over two years despite the fact that she hasn't violated any Canadian law,"" adding that it was a ""grave political incident.""

Before then the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser the first newspaper printed in Australia was considered a government publication and was censored by Governor King. When Robert Howe took over the printing from his convict father George, this new freedom.

Robert Howe

Perched on a stool, bent over trays of typeset, Robert Howe was just eight years old when the King’s Representative inspected the printing office of Australia’s first newspaper. Astonished to see such a small boy hard at work on the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, he smiled at Robert’s convict father and noted how ingeniously the press was run.

Despite a shortage of ink, paper and press type—as well as paying subscribers (there were plenty who took it then refused to settle their debts)—the newspaper soldiered on. It was regarded as of ‘inestimable value’ to both the settlers and the government.

The Gazette kept the settlers in touch with the news from home. Published three times weekly, it contained excerpts from English literature which not only helped keep loyalty to England alive but also encouraged education. Robert’s father, George, published material that fostered a love of literature and aimed to aid both teachers and pupils as they used it. He published his own poems as well as those of others and has a strong claim to the title of ‘Father of Australian Literature’.

By the time Robert was 25, his life had taken a downhill turn. He was deep into a world of reckless and careless self-indulgence when he experienced a spiritual awakening. In his own words, he was ‘wonderfully and mercifully visited by God and snatched from infamy in this world and Hell in the next.’

Early Methodist community

Influenced by the early Methodist community in Sydney, he began Australia’s first periodical magazine: The Australian Magazine; or, Compendium of Religious, Literary, and Miscellaneous Intelligence. He also inherited the printing and publishing business of his father at this time and, under his direction, the tone of the Sydney Gazette, changed completely. On 14 October 1824, under the editorship of Robert Howe, it ceased to be censored by the colonial government

Robert considered that to be ‘Printer to Immanuel’ was far more important than being government printer, so morality and religion became two of the main themes of the publication. The Gazette began to reflect his conviction that faith was the only

possible means of progress in Australia and the only way to rescue the colony from the ‘depths of awful depravity to Righteousness in the Son of God’.

Eventually he succeeded his father at the Gazette, by then Australia’s first daily newspaper. However, his policies of promoting Christianity as the solution to national problems brought him into conflict with many in the establishment. He was physically attacked, was subjected to several libel actions, and publicly horse-whipped.

Jesus said, ‘Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.’ (Matthew 5:10 NIV)

Robert Howe learned this first-hand as he strove to shine the light of Christ in the early days of Sydney and the New South Wales colony.

He died while out fishing when his boat overturned. Yet he pioneered a pastime for Australians that is still going. Even in this digital age, about 60% of Australians read a print magazine each week. The foundation stone of all this magazine production was a Christian periodical which spanned the turbulent transition of Sydney settlement from a penal colony to the premier city of a free state.

Yesterday, Thailand’s Department of Corrections announced that nearly 3,000 inmates at two prisons in Thailand’s capital had tested positive for COVID-19, amid the country’s ongoing outbreak of the virus.

In a statement, the department said that 1,785 of the 3,274 inmates tested positive at Bangkok Remand Prison, which holds detainees ahead of trial. At the Central Women’s Correctional Institution, 1,040 of the 4,475 inmates were infected, it said.

The department said in the statement that various “proactive measures” to control the coronavirus in prisons have been implemented, including a 21-day quarantine and two mandatory COVID-19 tests for new inmates. It said that all positive cases were receiving medical treatment and that critical cases would be transferred to outside hospitals.

“The Department of Corrections would like to confirm it can control the situation and that every prison has strict measures,” it said. According to Thai media reports, hundreds of people detained in provincial prisons such as in Chiang Mai and Narathiwat have also reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus.

After escaping from 2020 mostly untouched by the coronavirus, Thailand is battling its third and most serious wave of COVID-19, which spread from clusters at nightclubs and parties in the capital Bangkok last month.

Recent weeks have seen Thailand averaging around 2,000 new cases per day. On Wednesday, the country’s health authorities reported 1,983 new cases and 34 more deaths from COVID-19. This came a few days after Thailand detected its first case of the highly infectious B1617 variant of the coronavirus, which was first detected in India.

Today, Justice Minister Somsak Thepsutin held a press conference in which he put the 3,000 cases down to previous low testing, and said that the government has stepped up testing of inmates over the past three days. He said prison authorities are also planning to vaccinate all of the country’s 310,000 inmates.

It is unclear if the Thai government would have embarked on the testing spree were it not for the fact that a number of prominent political activists tested positive for COVID-19 during periods of pre-trial detention and publicly declared the fact over the past week. Chief among them was Panusaya Sitthijirawattanakul, who announced that she had tested positive after eight weeks of pretrial detention at the Central Women’s Correctional Institution. She was released on bail on May 6.

Panusaya is one of the student-led pro-democracy movement leaders who are awaiting trial on charges of lese majeste, after calling for reforms to curb the power and prerogatives of the country’s monarchy. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said that nine activists who were detained have tested positive for COVID-19, including Panusaya.

The Thai prison outbreaks highlight the disease risks posed by Asia’s overcrowded and unsanitary prisons and detention centers, something that rights groups and prison reform advocates have been warning of since the beginning of the pandemic.

In April 2020, Human Rights Watch said that “a major crisis” was brewing in Asia’s prisons. “Governments in Asia need to move quickly to reduce detention populations by releasing people who shouldn’t be in custody in the first place, like political prisoners and those jailed for minor offenses,” the group’s Asia advocacy director John Sifton said in a statement.

The Thai announcement came just days after Cambodian authorities discovered a small cluster of cases at Preah Sihanouk provincial prison in the south of the country. On May 8, it announced that 34 detainees at the prison had tested positive, prompting plans to test all of the country’s 40,000 inmates for COVID-19.

Mohamed Mounir, Egyptian journalist, died of COVID-19 infection in an Egyptian prison.

"" The murder of the great Egyptian journalist, Mohamed Mounir, is no less hideous than the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Egyptian journalists have demanded an international investigation into Mounir's death.""

Journalists and political activists have mourned the death of well-known journalist Mohamed Mounir, who died at the age of 65, as a result of being infected with coronavirus. Mounir was infected with coronavirus during his detention by the Egyptian authorities for two weeks, before being released, while suffering from the symptoms of the deadly virus.

Egyptian journalists considered that Mohamed Mounir was deliberately assassinated, and his body was cut without a saw, but rather by the coronavirus. These journalists consider that it is premeditated murder to arrest a person who has exceeded 65 years of age, suffers from diseases of aging and obesity, is breathing with difficulty, and is then transferred to the Tora Prison Hospital where the infected prisoners with coronavirus are.

One month ago, the Egyptian authorities raided Mohamed Mounir's house, broke the door of his apartment, and took some of its contents, but he was not there at the time.

Murder by coronavirus

Two days later, Mohamed Mounir was arrested from his home on June 15, transferred to the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP), and ordered to be imprisoned for 15 days pending investigations. Mounir was charged with misuse of social media and spreading false news, and the evidence was only some of Mounir's posts on Facebook.

Despite legal claims that Mounir should be released, given his age and worsening illnesses, the SSSP decided on June 27 to renew Mounir's imprisonment for 15 days. On July 1, Mounir's health worsened, and he was transferred to Tora Liman Hospital for a medical examination.

Journalists say that Mounir's transfer to that hospital was a death sentence and a full-fledged assassination, described by Egyptian journalist Wael Kandil as, ""Murder by the coronavirus dose."" Tora Liman Hospital receives a number of prisoners who are infected with coronavirus and putting Mounir there meant that his infection was inevitable.

On July 2, the SSSP decided to release Mohamed Mounir, and the next day he had already arrived at his home. However, on July 4, Mounir's health deteriorated significantly, he published a video clip complaining of the symptoms of infection with coronavirus, and asked the Egyptian Syndicate to intervene quickly to transfer him to any hospital, as hospitals are not receiving any patients having reached full capacity under coronavirus. On July 5, Mounir's body temperature was high, and his sons had to put him on a ventilator. On July 7, Mounir released a second video in which he called for help, saying that he was suffocating and unable to breathe. That video caused a sensation among journalists. Mounir was transferred to Agouza Hospital the next day, but he died less than one week later on July 13.

The saw of Khashoggi

Egyptian journalists demanded that the Egyptian regime be held accountable for the murder of Mounir. Egyptian journalist Mohamed Moustafa said on his Facebook page, ""The murder of the great Egyptian journalist Mohamed Mounir is no less terrible than the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi … but how many international tribunals will investigate the circumstances of his death?""

Sudanese journalist Hassan Ibrahim also wrote, ""Colleague Mohamed Mounir joined Jamal Khashoggi, and he fell among the martyrs of the word. He lived free and entered the detention centre and the detention was the means of killing him."" He added: ""In the conditions of the epidemic and the rapid spread of the disease, his infection was certain, and because he is sick, his death is certain … another crime against freedom of the press in our afflicted Arab world.""

An intoxicated young guy with tattooed arms and two girls sit in a small well-lit room in a private house in the Moscow Region; an unfinished bottle of whiskey is on the table; a sign reads: “Drink whiskey — 200 rubles [$3], French kiss — 1,000 rubles [$13.6].”

“Which of us is top?” one of the girls, who has bright pink hair, asks the man.

“Marinka's definitely top,” he replies, pointing to her friend.

The pink-haired lady, furious at the reply, rushes at the guy with her fists, but after a minute falls to the floor and disappears from the screen. After another couple of minutes, you can hear her screaming “Get me a cab!”; then the stream goes dead for several hours.

When filming resumes, we see the streamer dragging the already dead, half-naked woman across the floor, shakes her, strokes her hair and, with tearful eyes, tells her to wake up. He then takes questions from viewers, while the corpse lies in the background. The guy films the conversation with the ambulance crew that arrives.

“The problem was she shit her pants. Don’t know why. <...> It really stank,” he says to a paramedic.

“Is that why you kicked her out?” asks the latter.

""Yes."" <…>

“Tell everyone that you threw her out, and that’s why she died,” says the paramedic.

That was the night of Dec. 1-2, 2020, during a stream by Stas Reshetnikov, known as Reeflay or Panini, a Russian-speaking blogger who creates and monetizes broadcasts, which in Russia are called thrash streams.

According to the police investigation, the woman suffered a closed head injury and multiple bruising. On Dec. 4, 2020, a court in Moscow’s Ramensky District sentenced the blogger to two months imprisonment. Later, his lawyer Yevgeny Kulagin told news agency RIA Novosti that Reshetnikov was not to blame for the woman's death, claiming that she had died of a ""spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage.""

Nevertheless, following this incident, the Federation Council (Russia’s upper house of parliament) proposed a ban on thrash streams. How do these streams work, what other gruesome things happen, and who is willing to pay to watch it live?

Violent online parties

Most Russian-speaking thrash streamers appeared on Twitch, and later on YouTube, in the early 2010s. Almost all initially did game streaming, but due to low viewing figures and donations they decided to change the format.

Kirill Zyryanov (alias Vjlink) from Odintsovo, Moscow Region, is one of them. During a stream in 2013, he had a live drunken fight with a friend, lost a tooth, and became wildly popular as a result. Kirill continued his alcohol-infused streams, and soon began to perform dares for money from subscribers, including one in which he broadcast an operation to enlarge his penis (the organ itself was blurred). The blogger insisted that the video was exclusively for medical research purposes, yet the footage remains on YouTube to this day. The live stream was watched by 90,000 people.

Trash streams are usually broadcast from parties in the style of the 2012 movie Project X, but with extra humiliation and violence. During such ""parties,"" viewers pay 50-200 rubles ($0.70 – $2.70) to trash one of the participants. For more money, streamers are ready, among other things, to beat someone up, paint themselves luminous green, douse themselves in urine, or extinguish cigarettes on their body.

Streamers share the earnings when completing tasks with other participants. Here’s what blogger Andrei Burim (alias Mellstroy) did: he invited women to parties in Moscow-City and offered money for completing various tasks. During a stream in October 2020, he repeatedly slammed one woman headfirst into a table, after which YouTube blocked his channels, and the police opened a crim",[],[''],"{'instagram', 'murder', 'social media', 'blog', 'internet', 'media'}",['Victoria Ryabikova'],2021-01-15 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,"Standing in a corner for 150 rubles ($2), sucking a toe for 2,500 rubles ($34), sitting on a bottle for 3,000 rubles ($40).

the specific objective of this article is to engage the power elite in Western Nigeria, the most developed region in Nigeria, on why they do not need a federal Development Commission at this time to develop their region. It is also not to berate the southwest federal legislators who have sponsored the South West Development Commission Bill (2019) now being debated in Abuja. I just would like us to ‘calm down’ and reason together without raising dust over needless debate and bombast on why the Bill should be withdrawn. I would also like to appeal to those who have been promised some limitless opportunities that will come with setting up of a federal Commission – to develop the South West – to hold their breadth for now. Let’s debate the feasibility and risk assessment ‘reports’ on the legislative project. I just want us to engage one another on why that legislative project is though promising and prominent, it is not significant at this time. I would like to reiterate here that the bill (SWDC) will complicate development agenda for South West when we all need to persuade the ruling powers in Abuja to fulfil their promises on organic federalism. That is the clincher that will work in the long run for the South West.

So, let’s migrate from the debate on how their strong institutions have helped them to defend democracy and development agenda in America, their America. It’s a time to borrow some brilliance from Tip O’Neill, the proponent of all ‘politics is local’ saying and face our local politics this week. It is a time to speak again some truths to our local powers, notably to revive and sustain development agenda in Western Nigeria, the pacesetter region, which set the tone for physical, infrastructural development for Nigeria long before independence. For the young ones who didn’t know, the Western Region, Nigeria set up the first television station in Africa – Western Nigeria Television (WNTV) on 31st October 1959. That is what is today known as Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), which was seized by the military in 1977 when it was merged with Benue Plateau Television Corporation and Radio Kaduna Television and others. The same Western Nigeria built and opened the first stadium (in Africa) in Ibadan since 1960. It was originally named Liberty Stadium with a capacity for 25, 000 seats. It is also worth remembering that Western Nigeria had in (1956) opened its ‘foreign mission’ in the United Kingdom before Nigeria’s independence in 1960. The first Western Region’s envoy called “Agent-General” to the U.K was a lawyer of Itsekiri extraction, Chief M.E.R. Okorodudu. The residence the Western Region procured for its first ambassador is still the official residence of Nigeria’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. There are other firsts. But this is just to build a case against the South West Development Commission Bill that the region doesn’t need. And here is the epilogue against it: the Western Nigeria, which set the pace recalled above – even before independence should not be competing with war and terror zones that have had interventionist outfits to rebuild their broken walls – Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and North East Development Commission (NEDC). What is more, the NDDC has been fingered as a cesspool of corruption. Even there are snippets already from the NEDC that Nigeria’s public enemy, number one, corruption has found its way into the new northeast development agency, NEDC.

Amosun and 17 other senators on the SWDC Bill

When Senator Ibikunle Amosun, on behalf of 17 other senators, opened the debate on the Bill in March, 2020 on the floor of the Senate he noted the following:

‘…Mr. President, Distinguished colleagues, it is a great honour and privilege to, on behalf of all the l7 other Senators from the South West geopolitical zone of the country, lead the debate for an Act to establish the South West Development Commission… Mr President, Distinguished colleagues, this Bill was first read on the floor of the Senate in November, 2019. In leading this debate, I would like to crave your indulgence to stress that the issues that necessitated the enactment of this are prevalent in all the other geopolitical zones in the country. What this literarily means is that all the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria have more or less similar issues.

More than a dozen workers making products and components for Dyson are taking legal action against the company, alleging a string of labour abuses at a supplier in Malaysia.

The workers were employed at ATA Industrial, a division of ATA IMS, a major electronics manufacturer in Johor Bahru, which makes cordless vacuum cleaners and purifier fans for Dyson.

On top of this, one of the workers told Channel 4 News he was tortured by local police after concerns about unlawful working conditions in the factory were first raised in 2019.

Oliver Holland, a partner at UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing the workers, told Channel 4 News: “Our clients allege that they work under conditions of forced labour.

“They lived in unsanitary and crowded accommodation, and they lived under the constant threat of punishment and persecution by the factory management if they didn’t adhere to what they wanted them to do.”

Dyson categorically denies any wrongdoing and a representative will be appearing on Channel 4 News tonight to address the allegations.

ATA categorically denies any wrongdoing.

Between 2019 and 2021, Andy Hall, a labour rights activist in south east Asia, received repeated complaints from whistleblowers about forced working conditions at ATA and contacted Dyson to raise the alarm.

Dyson’s billionaire chairman and founder, Sir James Dyson, took the controversial decision to move its manufacturing base from the UK to Malaysia in 2002.

The ATA IMS group produces millions of parts and products each year for Dyson – including components for the Dyson Cool and Hot+Cool devices, Dyson Pure Cool devices; Dyson cordless vacuum cleaners including the V7, V8, V10 and V11 models, Dyson lighting products and Dyson electronic haircare products.",[],[''],set(),[],,,,True,2.0,,,en,https://www.business-humanrights.org/static/img/logo.1a41f6387d69.svg,https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/exclusive-dyson-faces-legal-action-over-forced-labour-and-exploitation/,<Element div at 0x7fc244999860>,<Element div at 0x7fc2459a35e0>,<Element html at 0x7fc2459a3a40>,<Element html at 0x7fc2459a3180>,{},32d9d66ddbf055c7a0cbf97d726a1607.1651837598.3108554,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,1cb0e0e8-67cc-241c-7b21-78d34dd37e14,2022_01_01-2022_02_28_gdelt_data.csv

EFF has long been concerned that—unless carefully drafted and limited—cyberstalking laws can be misused to criminalize political speech. In fact, earlier this year we celebrated a federal court decision in Washington State in the United States that tossed out an overbroad cyberstalking law. In the case, the law had been used to silence a protester who used strong language and persistence in criticizing a public official. EFF filed anamicus brief in that case where we cautioned that such laws could be easily misused and the court agreed with us.

Now the problem has occurred in a high-profile political case in Nigeria. Just this week the Nigerian government formally filed ""cyberstalking"" charges against Omoyele Sowore, a longtime political activist and publisher of the respected Sahara Reporters online news agency. Sowore had organized political protests in Nigeria under the hashtag #RevolutionNow and conducted media interviews in support of his protest. He was detained along with another organizer between early August and late September before being granted bail. He reports that he has been beaten and denied access to his family and, for a while, denied access to an attorney.

The charges make clear that this prosecution is a misuse of the overbroad cyberstalking statute, passed in 2015. They state that Sowore committed cyberstalking by: ""knowingly sent messages by means of press interview granted on 'arise Television' network which you knew to be false for the purpose of causing insult, enmity, hatred and ill-will on the person of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.""

That's it. The prosecution claims that you can ""cyberstalk"" the President by going on TV and saying allegedly false things about him with a goal of causing ""insult"" or ""ill-will."" This is obviously a misuse of the law and flatly inconsistent with freedom of expression under both Nigerian and international law. The President of Nigeria is a public figure and criticisms of his policies should be strongly protected. Instead, this prosecution appears to be a textbook case of a poorly drafted law being misused for political purposes.

Similar problems exist with the claim of ""treason,"" which is also based solely on Sowore's protest activities and the use of the ""#RevolutionNow"" slogan. There appear to be a similar political agenda behind the final charges for ""financial crimes,"" based on Sowore allegedly moving funds between his organization's own bank accounts.

Freedom of expression is a cherished, internationally recognized human right. Nigeria is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and additionally recognizes the right to free expression in its 1999 Constitution under section 39(1). Yet on its face, Nigeria's constitution (section 45.1) also allows many exceptions to freedom of expression that can essentially eviscerate the right, unless carefully interpreted. It's up to the courts and the prosecutors to protect freedom of expression and interpret any exceptions narrowly and carefully, and up to the legislature not to pass laws that can be so easily misused.

We hope that the judges and prosecutors of Nigeria recognize the problem in applying this cyberstalking law to prosecute a political activist. Nigeria has a long and proud tradition of peaceful but powerful political protest. Such protests are key to a functioning democracy. Protecting core and longstanding human rights such as freedom of expression, especially when that expression is aimed at convincing the public on a political matter, is the obligation of a modern government.

Matthews and his accomplice, Jaylyn Christopher Molina, plotted to share information on how to make bombs, and tried to recruit others for ISIS. They also planned jihad bombings themselves in New York City, at Trump Tower and the New York Stock Exchange. Matthews hoped these would be so catastrophic as to give them “rock star status” and even be “Netflix worthy.” And he may have been onto something: after Netflix went all in for pedophilia, why not jihad terror?

After his conversion, Molina began calling himself “Abdur Rahim” and Matthews went by “Ali Jibreel.” Matthews and Molina both also hated America, as Molina stated explicitly: “Let it be clear, I am against America. America is my enemy.” Besides their plans for New York City, they “also described attacking communications centers and plans to ‘fortify a town barrier and establish the first bases or establish a HQ.’” Bases, that is, from which they could launch more jihad attacks against targets within the country.

They not only plotted mayhem within the United States, but also both pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS), discussed traveling to Syria to join up with the jihad group, and even tried to make contact with an ISIS operative who would help them get there. Molina pursued his jihad online, posting instructions on how to train to handle an AK-47, as well as directions on how to build a bomb.

All this raises questions that have come up many times before, but no matter how many times this happens, these questions have never even been addressed, much less answered: why do so many converts to Islam come to hate their own country? Which comes first? Does their hatred of America lead to their conversion to a religion that has some adherents who are waging war against America? Or does their conversion turn them against their homeland?

Matthews and Molina are not by any means the first American converts to Islam to try to join ISIS, or to plot violence against their fellow Americans. Spc. Hasan Edmonds, a Muslim member of the U.S. Army National Guard, was arrested in 2015 at Chicago’s Midway Airport; he had been planning to join the Islamic State. His cousin, Jonas “Yunus” Edmonds, was arrested as well. They had allegedly been plotting a jihad attack against a U.S. military facility.

Is it just a coincidence that so many converts to Islam come to regard the country in which they were born and raised, the land of the families and forefathers, as an enemy? Or is there some connection?

Spc. Hasan Edmonds clearly believed that his new religion required a shift of his allegiance. “I am already in the American kafir [infidel] army,” he told an informant in January, “and now I wish only to serve in the army of Allah alongside my true brothers.”

Other American converts to Islam who have turned traitor include Sgt. Hasan Akbar, an American engineer from the 101st Airborne Division, who murdered Captain Christopher Scott Seifert, Major Gregory Stone, and wounded fifteen others in a grenade and small-arms attack in northern Kuwait on March 22, 2003. As he committed his murders, Sgt. Akbar yelled: “You guys are coming into our countries, and you’re going to rape our women and kill our children.”

Akbar referred to “our women” and “our children” despite the fact that he was not Iraqi or Kuwaiti; he was an American from Los Angeles. But when he became a Muslim, any allegiance he may have had to America was gone. In the same way, al-Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn and the most famous of the traitor converts, the Marin County Mujahid, John Walker Lindh, who was captured in Afghanistan fighting against American troops, also turned against the country of their birth and joined its fiercest enemies.

All these examples, and there are many, many more like them, raise additional questions as well. Chief among them is this: why, when these Americans converted to Islam, did they fall prey to what we are constantly told is a twisted and hijacked version of a peaceful religion? Why wasn’t the peaceful, tolerant, true Islam that everyone assumes converts to Islam are taught in mosques in the U.S. able to withstand challenge from the supposedly un-Islamic vision that ISIS peddles? Why aren’t the mosques they attended being investigated? And above all, why are our",[],[''],set(),['Robert Spencer'],2020-11-27 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,"Why, when these Americans converted to Islam, did they fall prey to what we are constantly told is a twisted and hijacked version of a peaceful religion?",en,/apple-touch-icon.png,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/robert-spencer/2020/11/27/south-carolina-man-converts-to-islam-plots-netflix-worthy-jihad-massacre-n1179044,<Element section at 0x7f3f82113cc0>,<Element section at 0x7f3f8213aa40>,<Element html at 0x7f3f8213ad60>,<Element html at 0x7f3f8213a810>,{},aafe4d99ed64d5b567c3e4915e20b9db.1652173059.6289232,gdelt_events,10-05-2022,c947b0f7-b41c-80ed-3b19-11f0d7376d09,2020_11_01-2020_12_31_gdelt_data.csv

Deputy Reserve Bank Governor Kuben Naidoo

The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) today (Friday, October 18) hosted a gala dinner in honour of those who fought for the freedom of the press, and those who continue to do so.

The Annual SANEF Black Wednesday Gala Dinner was held at the historic Emoyeni venue in Parktown, Johannesburg. It was addressed by Kuben Naidoo, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank.

Naidoo said that in many ways, the media and central banks struggle with the same dance: the need for independence balanced by the need to be held accountable to society.

His speech titled “Independence and accountability: renewing trust” argued that Journalists’ integrity rests on the need to be independent of political interference and commercial imperatives, at the same time holding public trust through being accountable for what they say, write, publish or broadcast.

Similarly, central banks seek to be independent from political and commercial interference while holding the trust of the public through being open, transparent, impartial and accountable. Neither of us, journalists nor central banks, are in a popularity contest. It is our responsibility to tell the truth in all its gory detail. Hence, our social licence to operate depends not on our popularity but on our integrity.

This battle for independence while being trusted by society occurs in an environment of mind-boggling complexity. There are commercial pressures, political noise and the all-important societal context within which South Africa finds itself in today – the ‘baggage’ we all carry, as a nation, so to speak. Added to this is the rapid technological change which democratises the media while simultaneously lowering standards. This technological advance makes it easier and quicker to communicate, to tell stories, and to share an experience or a narrative, but it also makes it harder to distil truth from fiction. Seeking truth and facts has become that much harder.

At this point in time, let me opine that I think you have a tougher job than I do. Maintaining journalistic integrity in today’s world is harder than safeguarding an independent central bank. There is only one central bank per country, and with some effort and careful institutional design, we can try to maintain our independence while still creating mechanisms for society to hold us accountable. We still require integrity, though.

Sanef chairperson Mahlatse Mahlase

Sanef chairperson Mahlatse Mahlase said the reality of South Africa was that the lifeblood of democracy was under threat, the media industry as a whole was fighting for its economic survival and pushing back on what appears to be an orchestrated campaign to silence investigative reporting exposing the greed and ills of our politicians.

“Yes, today we gather to remember the heroes of our liberation struggle – those who used the might of the pen to risk their lives so that today we can be free to speak truth to power – protected by our celebrated constitution.”

“We honour the men and women who despite the real danger of the evil regime, said we will force into the open the atrocities of the apartheid government,” she said.

She mentioned men and women who fought for media freedom in the country such as Percy Qoboza, Joe Thloele, Mathatha Tsedu, Aagrey Klaaste, Juby Mayet (worked for Drum), Thenjiwe Mtintso (was at Daily Dispatch and detained with Biko), Ruth First.

She also said that it was the 42nd anniversary of Black Wednesday – when the Nationalist party government attempted to silence the media by banning newspapers and organizations that were part of the black consciousness movement. They also arrested prominent journalists who dedicated their lives to die by the pen.

after the United States said it would step aside to allow for Turkish military operations in the area.

“We don’t know what is going to happen. We are preparing for the worst,” the UN regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria, Panos Moumtzis, says in Geneva.

Turkey has threatened an offensive in Syria against Kurdish forces which it considers terrorists.

Moumtzis says there are “a lot of unanswered questions” about the consequences of the operation.

He adds that the UN is “in contact with all sides” on the ground.

But he makes clear his office did not have advance warning about the US decision, which effectively abandons the Kurds, Washington’s main allies in the long battle against the so-called Islamic State group.

Moumtzis says the UN’s priorities are to ensure that any prospective Turkish offensive not result in new displacements, that humanitarian access remain unhindered and that no restrictions be put in place on freedom of movement.

The Biden administration announced Friday the United States will reimpose sanctions on Belarus after President Alexander Lukashenko forced the diversion of a commercial Ryanair flight last week to arrest a journalist on board. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight White House officials called the May 23 incident “a direct affront to international norms” in a blistering statement issued late Friday night that included a long list of punishments that would be enacted against Belarus and against key members of the Lukashenko regime.

“These events took place amid an escalating wave of repression by the Lukashenka regime against the aspirations of the people of Belarus for democracy and human rights,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

According to the White House, the United States on Thursday will reimpose full blocking sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises. Biden administration officials are also coordinating with allies in the European Union and elsewhere to develop “a list of targeted sanctions against key members” of Lukashenko’s regime, Psaki said.

Meanwhile, Treasury Department officials are working on a new executive order for President Biden to review that would increase his authority to impose sanctions on “elements” of Lukashenko’s regime, she added.

“We take these measures, together with our partners and Allies, to hold the regime accountable for its actions and to demonstrate our commitment to the aspirations of the people of Belarus,” Psaki said.

The diverted Ryanair flight had been en route May 23 from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, when — while in Belarusian airspace — air traffic controllers in Belarus ordered the plane to land in Minsk, citing possible explosives on board. After the flight was intercepted, Belarusian authorities arrested passenger Roman Protasevich, an opposition journalist, and his girlfriend, Russian activist Sofia Sapega.

The brazen seizure of the commercial jetliner, which was carrying 123 passengers, prompted international outrage and condemnation. Earlier this week, the State Department issued a Level 4 warning urging U.S. citizens not to travel to Belarus, and the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday warned U.S. commercial airlines to “exercise extreme caution” when considering passing through Belarusian airspace. The United States will also suspend its discretionary application of the 2019 U.S.-Belarus Air Services Agreement, the White House said Friday.

The punishments are similar to those enacted by European Union leaders, all 27 of whom agreed Monday to toughen sanctions on Lukashenko’s authoritarian government, bar E.U. airlines from traversing Belarusian airspace and prevent Belavia, Belarus’s national airline, from flying over or landing in E.U. territory.

Trump trails Biden in national opinion polls. But the race is seen as close in enough swing states that Trump could still piece together the 270 votes needed to prevail in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner.

- A federal judge in Texas will consider whether Houston officials should throw out about 127,000 votes already cast at drive-through voting sites in the Democratic-leaning area. The case has been brought by a Republican state legislator and others who accuse the Harris County clerk, a Democrat, of exceeding his authority by allowing drive-through voting as an alternative during the coronavirus pandemic.

- The election has all the ingredients for a drawn-out court battle over its outcome: a highly polarized electorate, a record number of mail-in ballots and some Supreme Court justices who appear ready to step in if there is a closely contested race.

- When lifelong Democrat Mayra Gomez told her 21-year-old son five months ago she was voting for Trump, he cut her out of his life. Bitter splits within families and among friends over Trump’s tumultuous presidency will be difficult, if not impossible, to repair, even after he leaves office.

- Every U.S. presidential election has its own lingo, like the “hanging chads” on voting cards in Florida that led to a landmark court battle in 2000. A look at some of the jargon used in the days leading up to the Nov. 3 election.

- There have been pockets of unrest in battleground states ahead of the showdown between Trump and Biden in Tuesday’s election. Trump, who previously declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he decides results are fraudulent, could bring in the military or federal agents to quell civil unrest on Election Day. A look at the laws that give Trump authority in this area, and the limitations on his power.

BY THE NUMBERS

- Biden’s lead has widened a little in the final days of the 2020 campaign in three critical Rust Belt states that Trump narrowly won four years ago, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls released Sunday. Biden leads Trump by 10 percentage points in Wisconsin and Michigan, and the presidential nominee is ahead by seven points in Pennsylvania.

GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE

- Cuba has more at stake in the Nov. 3 election than most Latin American countries as the Trump administration has focused much of its foreign policy in the region on measures it says are aimed at bringing about democracy in the country.

INVESTOR VIEW

- Wall Street investment firms, faced with the prospect of a chaotic election complicated by an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots, have hired political analysts and crunched voting data to game out election night and identify a watch list of crucial counties and Senate races that might indicate which way the vote is headed.

- Biden has promised to push his own tax proposals on day one if he wins Tuesday’s election including raising the corporate tax to 28% and doubling the rate to 21% on overseas profits from patents, copyrights and trademarks.

facilities, describing this as “problematic” for the accused.

30 year-old construction worker Matthew Debono and his partner, nail technician Josette Azzopardi, both from Qormi were arrested by police executing a warrant on 8 March. 44 sachets of suspected cocaine and heroin were found at their home, inspector Marshal Mallia told Magistrate Nadine Lia this morning.

Inspector Mallia said that an inquiry had been appointed and that Azzopardi’s fingerprints and Debono’s DNA were found on the outside of the sachets in question.

A not-guilty plea was entered by defence lawyers Mario Mifsud, Matthew Xuereb, Christian Camilleri.

Mifsud requested bail and the prosecution did not object as there were no civilian witnesses to testify in this case. The accused lived together and had children, he said.

The accused were charged in separate arraignments on Wednesday.

Mifsud informed the court that the couple have been on police bail for 3 months and had obeyed orders without problems. “So far we have a sachet of alleged drugs and DNA on the outside of it,” pointed out the lawyer, adding that according to changes in the law, cohabiting couples even if not married, cannot be compelled to testify against each other, he said. Inspector Mallia told the court that the best evidence in this case wasn’t their testimony and declared that the accused would not be asked to testify against each other.

In addition, Mifsud argued, the accused had released statements showing the dynamics of the case and the evidence was conserved. “Unfortunately, we don’t have a laboratory to test the substances, and that’s another problem.” It is not the first time that such a complaint has been made to the Maltese courts.

The court after ascertaining with the prosecution as to why bail was not being objected to, granted the pair bail ordering them to sign a bail book at regular intervals, observe a curfew and secure their bail by depositing €1000 in the acts of the case, as well as provide a personal guarantee of €5000.",[],[''],set(),[],,,,True,2.0,,This is not the first time that such a complaint has been made to the Maltese courts,en,/ui/images/icons/Icon-Small@2x.png,https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/109885/lawyer_says_lack_of_drug_testing_facilities_problematic_as_couple_charged_with_cocaine_and_heroin_possession,<Element div at 0x7f1ba193a900>,<Element div at 0x7f1ba1975c70>,<Element html at 0x7f1ba1913310>,<Element html at 0x7f1ba1913180>,{},e72c229e441f91a417f198811b9172c8.1652029396.599,gdelt_events,08-05-2022,29bdbd57-126c-3a58-ed30-36bbe79a0ab5,2021_05_01-2021_06_30_gdelt_data.csv

3 David Byrne died in February 2016

He is charged with participating in or contributing to activity intending to or being reckless as to whether such participation or contribution could facilitate the commission of a serious offence by a criminal organisation or any of its members, to wit the murder of David Byrne, by providing access to individual motor vehicles to that criminal organisation or its members, within the State on February 5, 2016.

Objecting to bail, Detective Garda Deirdre Quinn of Clontarf Garda Station told Ms Maddie Grant BL, for the State, that the objection to bail was based on the seriousness of the crime, the strength of the evidence and that there were concerns over witness intimidation.

CRIME TRANSPORT

Det Gda Quinn said it will be alleged that Mr Murphy, a taxi-driver, supplied logistical support to the crime group on the day by being part of a six-vehicle convoy involved in the murder.

Ms Grant said that Mr Murphy, who is a part-time taxi-driver, had €1,000 towards bail but Det Gda Quinn said she would not be satisfied by any bail conditions.

Defending barrister Mr Mark Lynam BL said his client met with gardai by arrangement when he was arrested and interviewed in May 2016.

Mr Lynam said that despite the ""dramatic and tragic"" events since the 2016 shooting that his client had remained in Swords, save for one single weekend away in Wales and that he had ""no ties further afield"".

BAIL AMOUNT

Counsel said that Mr Murphy's partner, who also works part-time, is also in Ireland and that his children suffered with medical issues.

Mr Lynam said that the €1,000 offered towards bail had been put together by the family and that it was ""the extent of which he [Mr Murphy] can raise - he doesn't have a big sum"".

Mr Murphy told Mr Lynam that the Covid pandemic had had a lot of impact on his ability to earn, that he was not in a position to offer more money towards his bond, and that his children suffered with stroke and epilepsy.

Presiding judge Mr Justice Tony Hunt said that the maximum sentence for the charge was 15 years and that, if guilty, a sentence ""north of eight years"" could be applied in a ""worst case scenario"".

The judge said that Mr Murphy not showing up for court was a risk as he may wish to avoid such a sentence.

FINDING A SURETY

Mr Justice Hunt asked if Mr Murphy had any acquaintances who could act as an independent surety and was told by the accused: ""I keep myself to myself; it's just me and the family"".

The judge said that the offer of €1,000 was ""insufficient"" and that an independent surety would be required for bail to meet the risk, adding that he was reluctant to specify a figure.

Mr Justice Hunt said that ""in principle"" bail would be granted if an ""independent element, or acquaintance"" could be attached to the application.

Mr Murphy will appear at the three-judge court on Monday alongside his two co-accused, Jason Bonney and Patrick Dowdall, when they will bring their bail applications.

Mr Bonney, 50, of Drumnigh Wood, Portmarnock, Dublin 13, is also charged with participating in or contributing to activity intending to or being reckless as to whether such participation or contribution could facilitate the commission of a serious offence by a criminal organisation or any of its members, to wit the murder of David Byrne, by providing access to individual motor vehicles to that criminal organisation or its members, within the State on February 5, 2016.

Mr Dowdall, 64, with an address at Navan Road, Cabra, Dublin 7, is accused of participating in or contributing to activity intending to or being reckless as to whether such participation or contribution could facilitate the commission of a serious offence by a criminal organisation or any of its members, to wit the murder of David Byrne, by making a room available at the Regency Hotel, Drumc",[],[''],"{'Garda', 'An Garda Siochana', 'Courts'}",['Paul Neilan'],2021-04-21 16:18:07+00:00,,,True,2.0,,ONE of three Dublin men accused of helping a crime gang murder David Byrne at the Regency Hotel five years ago may be granted bail if he can find an i,en,https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/11/cropped-cropped-cropped-icon-e1459786005667-1.png?strip=all&w=32,https://www.thesun.ie/news/6884801/man-charged-regency-hotel-shooting-bail-surety/,<Element div at 0x7f5d5e99c5e0>,<Element div at 0x7f5d5e99c2c0>,<Element html at 0x7f5d5e98f860>,<Element html at 0x7f5d5e98f400>,{},50e8bbe3c8d2265d7094d0e2d73b1e93.1652098747.4932618,gdelt_events,09-05-2022,a3039297-a419-7c0f-50c4-913d6423eedb,2021_03_01-2021_04_30_gdelt_data.csv

Earlier this month, world-renowned music star Ed Sheeran was involved in a lawsuit which dealt with copyright infringement for his critically acclaimed song 'Shape of You'. The 11-day trial saw Sheeran defend his music from the infringement allegations, which resulted in him winning the legal battle. This article depicts the legal aspects of the case and gives an overview of the copyright legislation in Malta and local and international protection.

Facts About the Case

The British grime artist Sam Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch, accused Sheeran of infringement over 'Shape of You' released in 2017, which according to Chokri, had ""strikingly similar"" features to his 2015 song 'Oh Why'.

Chokri's case was based on the premise that the chord progression and musical hook of Sheeran's song, whose lyrics include the words ""Oh I"", are similar to his own song's hook which includes the lyrics ""Oh why"". In 2018, Chokri requested that the Performing Rights Society add him as a co-author to 'Shape of You'. This request resulted in the song's royalties being temporarily frozen. Together with the song's co-writers, Sheeran proceeded to sue Sam Chokri over this temporary freeze on the song's royalties, and consequently, a counterclaim was filed against the 'Shape of You songwriters for copyright infringement.

Copyright Legislation in Malta

Copyright protection is afforded under Maltese law through the Copyright Act, Chapter 415 of the laws of Malta (the ""Act""). Article 3 of the Act acknowledges that 'musical works' are a form of copyrightable work. In order for such works to be eligible for copyright protection, which works can take various forms, namely written, recorded, fixed, or otherwise reduced to material form, they must also have an original character.

Local Protection

Copyright as a rudimentary legal instrument aims at safeguarding and offering protection to the work that is eligible for copyright protection, as long as the work meets the criteria of qualification, originality and fixation.

Article 4 of the Act specifies that music is eligible for copyright protection if the author or joint authors are either Maltese citizens, residents or domiciled in Malta. The author(s) may also be a resident in another State where copyright protection is afforded by the same international treaty to which Malta is a party. For musical work to meet the originality requirement, it must be shown that the work produced was done so solely by the author(s) in question and that said author(s) must prove that it is through the author's distinctive intellectual input that the music is original. The last criterion which must be met is that of fixation- work is only protected by copyright if it is available in either written, recorded, or otherwise reduced to material form.

Once all the above-mentioned requirements are satisfied, any piece of work can be afforded copyright protection and upon its certification, the musical work is given legal protection. Copyright protection is conferred for a finite period, which period varies. Generally, protection of copyrightable work will continue to be in force for up to 70 years following the author's death, however, in relation to music and other literary pieces, such protection is valid for up to 50 years from the performer's death.

International Protection

At an EU level, various implemented Directives and regulations ensure that the same protection is afforded to individuals who are members of an EU Member State. The enforcement of intellectual property is regulated by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).

Although the lawsuit between Sheeran and Chokri took place outside the European Union, that is in the United Kingdom, both Sheeran and Chokri are protected by and subject to other intellectual property laws, primarily the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 which is the principal legislation covering intellectual property rights in the United Kingdom and the work to which it applies, and international instruments, namely the Berne Convention, which Malta is also a party to.

Coincidental Similarities?

The key element of this particular lawsuit was based on the similarity between key parts of the two songs. Chokri's argument was that Sheeran had not only listened to his music but proceeded to copy elements of the hook and passed it off as his own. If this were the case, this would forgo any pr",[],"['mondaq', 'Shape Of You: The Laws Behind Music Copyright', 'Intellectual Property', 'Copyright', 'Media', 'Telecoms', 'IT', 'Entertainment', 'Music and the Arts', '']",set(),"['Author S', 'Christina', 'Borg Debono', 'Article Tags']",,,,True,2.0,,"Earlier this month, world-renowned music star Ed Sheeran was involved in a lawsuit which dealt with copyright infringement for his critically acclaimed song ‘Shape of You'.",en,/apple-icon-57x57.png,https://www.mondaq.com/copyright/1186438/shape-of-you-the-laws-behind-music-copyright,<Element div at 0x7fc08607b860>,<Element div at 0x7fc0860aea90>,<Element html at 0x7fc08607b680>,<Element html at 0x7fc08607bb80>,{},dff7c546ba1790a012086aaaeef7568c.1651830181.9010274,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,d113ee73-67d2-901a-39e7-3e89b4f22416,2022_03_01-2022_05_06_gdelt_data.csv

gunpoint.

Grant Bailey has not been seen since Saturday when he was arrested by the Islamists during a security crackdown in Kabul.

It is feared the NGO worker in his 50s is being held in one of the capital's notorious prison complexes.

Mr Bailey, who is married and from southern England, had worked in Afghanistan for years and returned in September after the Taliban seized power.

The Foreign Office is desperately trying to locate him amid increasing fears for his safety.

A UK security source told the Daily Mirror Mr Bailey was arrested at gunpoint on Saturday.

They said: 'We were quite surprised he went back to Kabul after the Western withdrawal as the security situation there is obviously much worse.

'Added to that the Taliban government is making it very difficult for the few ex-pats working there, making it very difficult to travel.

'A lot of people are trying to get to the bottom of what has happened to him, where he is being held and under what charges.'

The Foreign Office told MailOnline: 'We are aware of the detention of a British national in Afghanistan and have been in touch with their family to support them.'

It comes after a dozen Afghan intelligence officers who spied for British troops say they have been left to the mercy of the Taliban despite being promised safe passage to the UK.

The 11 men and one woman worked for the country's National Directorate of Security (NDS), an agency disbanded by the Taliban after they seized the capital Kabul in August.

They are among thousands of Afghans and Britons still to be evacuated from the war-torn country.

It has also been claimed that RAF aircraft evacuating desperate Afghans from the region have been returning to the UK virtually empty. (File photo)

The NDS officers conducted surveillance operations for British forces - including undercover missions for MI5 and MI6 to infiltrate groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda - with their primary role was to unearth terrorist plots in Afghanistan or against the West.

The operatives, whose ranks range from colonel to major general, are in hiding with their families. One officer was given an 'Eagle' award from British troops for valour on his secret missions.

Human rights groups claim more than 100 former NDS officers have been executed by the Taliban since August.

Susan Mateen, from the Afghan Council of Great Britain (ACGB) which is campaigning to bring them to Britain, said the suicide bomb attack at Kabul airport on August 26 had prevented the dozen NDS officers from being flown out. They have since been told that they need to cross into Pakistan before they can be rescued.

'These 12 individuals served Britain and British counter terrorism missions loyally with many having 10 years or more of service, which in turn kept British troops safe and stopped terrorism to our shores,' said Ms Mateen. 'The British government has a duty to save them, but the UK has abandoned them to the Taliban.'

It was revealed earlier this month that the Taliban have beheaded or hanged dozens of prisoners and publicly displayed their bodies in extrajudicial killings.

A UN report said the militant group has also been recruiting child soldiers, and has been quashing women's rights since taking power in Afghanistan in August.

More than than 100 former Afghan national security forces and others have been killed since the takeover, the UN Human Rights Council heard.

Families of loved ones detained after the protest are appealing for help, ITV News Correspondent Emma Murphy reports

Families of detained demonstrators who took to the streets of Cuba to protest against the government are still yet to hear from them, almost a week on.

More than 100 protesters are said to have been detained or have disappeared since the protests began on Sunday. It is unclear what condition they are in.

Protests began on Sunday over food shortages, high prices and other grievances against the government.

Police scuffle and detain an anti-government demonstrator during a protest in Havana, Cuba on Sunday.

With limited or no access to internet, people are struggling to speak out about what is happening to them.

Solvig Font was able to access a few minutes of internet to tell her story. She was detained at the protest and 11 of her friends were taken away.

She claims the protests were peaceful until plain-clothed police officers arrived at the scene.

Speaking to ITV News, she said change must come: ""We have rights and we have a lot of problems and the state have to answer to us.

""The state has to change because we are in misery.""

Solvig Font was arrested at the protest along with 11 of her friends and is now under surveillance.

Ms Font is under surveillance by the state.

One man died during the protests, but those released from custody believe the number is much higher.

Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, 36, died on Monday during a clash between protesters and police in the Arroyo Naranjo municipality on the outskirts of Havana, the Interior Ministry of Cuba confirmed on Tuesday.

Julio Llopiz-Casal, a protester, says he believes police have killed people by beating them and with weapons.

Julio Llopiz-Casal, who was protesting on Sunday, believes there have been more deaths than have been announced.

He said: ""There has been a lot of police violence, the police have killed people.

""They've killed people with physical blows, they've killed people using their weapons.""

Henry Constantin, a journalist at the protests, remains in detention.

His mother Maria told ITV News her son now fears he and his colleagues will face long prison sentences.

Maria is appealing for help on behalf of her journalist son, who is still being detained.

""I want to ask the world for their help, for the freedom of my son, for the freedom of other journalists,"" she said.

""They are valuable young people, young people who need help in Cuba.""

The demonstrations are some of the biggest Cuba has seen in years.

in Jordan have arrested a former right-hand man of King Abdullah, who played a major role in developing the country’s economic policy, as well as a junior member of the royal family.

The men were reportedly detained on security grounds.

Initial reports that Prince Hamzah bin Hussein, a son of the late King Hussein by his fourth wife Queen Noor, had also been detained were not true, the Jordanian military high command and government media outlets said.

Quote Claims that have been published about his highness prince Hamzah having being arrested are not true

The official Petra news agency announced the arrests of Bassem Awadallah, royal family member Sharif Hassan Ben Zaid and other unnamed figures for ""security-related"" reasons.

Mr Awadallah was once a key player in drawing up the country's economic policy and served as chief of the Royal Hashemite Court until stepping down in 2008.

An investment banker by profession, he was seen as a capable economist, rising to the position of economic adviser to the prime minister in the 1990s, after obtaining a PhD from the London School of Economics.

Cabinet positions soon followed, including Minister of Planning and International Cooperation in 2001 and Minister of Finance in 2005, before he took on advisory roles with the royal court.

Prince Hamzah arrest reports denied

Meanwhile, Prince Hamzah said in a video recording he was under house arrest and had been told to stay at home and not contact anyone.

Speaking in English in the video, passed by his lawyer to the BBC, he said he was not part of any foreign conspiracy and described the ruling system as corrupt.

""[Jordan's] well-being has been put second by a ruling system that has decided that its personal interests, financial interests, that its corruption is more important than the lives and dignity and future of the ten million people who live here,"" he said.

But Army Chief of Staff Yousef Huneiti said ""claims that have been published about his highness Prince Hamzah having been arrested are not true.""

Maj Gen Huneiti said Prince Hamzah had been asked to “stop movements and activities that are employed to target the security of Jordan and its stability”.

""Investigations are ongoing and the outcome will be announced with all due transparency,"" he said.

""All measures have been taken according to the law, and no one is above the law. Jordan’s security is above all considerations.""

Arrests of top officials and royal family members are rare in Jordan.

Regional support

Saudi Arabia was quick to issue a statement of support for the Jordanian government, emphasising that it would ""stand by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and give its full support with all its capabilities for all decisions and measures taken by King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein and His Highness Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown Prince, to maintain security and stability"".

The UAE highlighted its ""full solidarity"" with the kingdom as well as support for decisions taken by King Abdullah and Prince Hussein ""to preserve the security and stability of Jordan and defuse every attempt to influence them"".

""The UAE affirms that the security and stability of Jordan is an integral part of its security,"" the statement carried by Wam said, quoting the Ministry of Presidential Affairs.

The US State Department said King Abdullah was a ""key partner"" of the United States and ""has our full support"".

State Department spokesman Ned Price said: ""We are closely following the reports and in touch with Jordanian officials. King Abdullah is a key partner of the United States, and he has our full support.""

Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa also voiced his support for the king and ""his measures to maintain security and stability in brotherly Jordan, and defuse every attempt to influence them,"" state news agency BNA reported.

The Gulf Cooperation Council's secretary general said in a statement on Saturday that the GCC stands with Jordan and all its measures to maintain its security and stability.

Qatar also issued a statement of support for ""all the decisions and measures"" taken by King Abdullah to maintain peace and stability in Jordan.

Egypt voiced its support to King Abdullah “to maintain the security and stability of the kingdom against any attempts to undermine it”, the presidency spokesman said on Facebook

British Transport Police (BTP) said Jamie Glover, 31, was arrested at York station after being part of a group causing a disturbance on a train.

As he was being led to a police van, he turned towards an officer and spat in his face, according to the force.

The incident happened at around 1pm on October 18.

BTP said Glover, of Wyvern Close, Batley, West Yorkshire, was found guilty at York Magistrates’ Court of assaulting an emergency worker and being drunk and disorderly.

He failed to appear at a sentencing hearing on Tuesday.

Bodycam footage showed Glover spitting in the officer’s face (BTP/PA)

Sergeant James Finch of BTP said: “There’re few things more disgusting than being spat at on duty. It’s completely repulsive behaviour, reserved for offenders either completely ignorant of the consequences or who have no respect for themselves or other people.

“This was initially a low-level case of anti-social behaviour, instead Glover chose to seriously escalate the situation and assault one of our officers.

“This is something we take extremely seriously, it’s not accepted as part of the job and he will face the consequences.”

Anyone with information about Glover’s whereabouts is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 405040 and quoting reference 1900089635.",[],[''],set(),[],2019-10-24 13:31:30,,,True,2.0,,Shocking footage has been released by British Transport Police.,en,/resources/images/8758462/,https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/national/17990987.drunken-train-passenger-shown-spitting-police-officers-face/,<Element div at 0x7ef6f99164f0>,<Element div at 0x7ef6f9916090>,<Element html at 0x7ef6f80076d0>,<Element html at 0x7ef6f80075e0>,{},2a715f4d6842c6df6e9ddb9daa8987b4.1652460272.5456557,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,9462410f-72f8-6a7b-c408-7cba4883a5d2,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Former Union Minister Maneka Gandhi said, “You can’t kill people because you want to”. “ Jo bhi hua hai bohot bhayanak hua hai is desh ke liye [What happened was horrifying for the country]... You cannot kill people because you want to. You cannot take the law in your hands. They [accused] would have been hanged by the court anyhow,” she said.

In January 2020, an alarming email from Google landed in McCoy’s inbox. Police were requesting his user data, the company told him, and McCoy had seven days to go to court and block its release.

McCoy later found out the request was part of an investigation into the burglary of a nearby home the year before. The evidence that cast him as a suspect was his location during his bike ride – information the police obtained from Google through what is called a geofence warrant. For simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, McCoy was being investigated and, as a result, his Google data was at risk of being handed over to the police.

Geofence location warrants and reverse search warrants such as the ones McCoy dealt with are increasingly becoming the tool of choice for law enforcement. Google revealed for the first time in August that it received 11,554 geofence location warrants from law enforcement agencies in 2020, up from 8,396 in 2019 and 982 in 2018.

It’s a concerning trend, argue experts and advocates. They worry the increase signals the start of a new era, one in which law enforcement agencies find ever more creative ways to obtain user information from data-rich tech companies. And they fear agencies and jurisdictions will use this relatively unchecked mechanism in the context of new and controversial laws such as the criminalization of nearly all abortions in Texas.

“As long as the data exists, all it takes is a creative law enforcement officer to say, ‘Hey, we can get a warrant or we can send a subpoena for this particular subset of the data that’s already being harvested’,” said Caleb Kenyon, the defense attorney who represented McCoy, to the Guardian. “They’re coming up with everything they can to do their job. That’s all it takes for the next type of [reverse] search warrant to come about.”

Dragnet search warrant

Lawyers such as Kenyon and privacy experts argue geofence and other broad warrants such as those that ask companies to sift through keywords people searched for are akin to a general warrant, made illegal by the fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Unlike other kinds of search warrants, which are targeted and seek information about people who law enforcement has probable cause to believe has committed a specific crime, these warrants don’t have a particular person in mind.

In other words, with reverse search warrants law enforcement is still looking for their suspect and they’re asking tech companies to give them a list of people to investigate. For geofence warrants, anyone in a certain place at a certain time becomes a suspect and is subject to further investigation which could mean giving police even more of their user data. For keyword search warrants, another relatively new mechanism to obtain user information that has emerged, anyone who searched for a certain phrase or address becomes a suspect.

The latter is potentially more far-reaching than geofence warrants, Kenyon argues, because keyword search warrants are not necessarily geographically or tangibly tied to a specific crime and could make suspects out of people around the world who happened to search for specific terms. “It’s what I would frame more of as a true digital warrant, without any ties or connections or tethers to the physical world,” he said.

Privacy groups argue that tech companies bear responsibility in law enforcement’s growing access to these types of data by developing new features that index user information in a way that makes it more searchable.

One such feature is Apple’s proposed child sexual abuse material detection (CSAM) function, which would analyze images to detect child sexual abuse images.

“From our position, creating more vulnerabilities on our devices that can be abused whether by authoritarian governments or by law enforcement or hackers doesn’t make anyone safer,” said Caitlin Seeley George, the director of campaigns and operations at Fight for the Future, which organized a protest outside Apple stores in 11 cities to pressure the company into abandoning its plans for the feature. “It absolutely fits into the dragnet search and surveillance function of law enforcement because it makes images searchable.

Another round of the hearing of the Bhima Koregaon Inquiry Commission concluded in Pune after it assembled for two days on 6 and 7 September. So far, the commission has fully examined 10 witnesses, and five more are being cross-examined, said Ashish Satpute, advocate for the commission.

“The witnesses have appeared several times over the course of these hearings,” he said. “We started with victims and eyewitnesses that were on the spot because they have given us a sense of the facts on the ground. We will shortly begin the examinations of government office bearers.”

It was on 9 February, 2018, that the Maharashtra government issued a notification of the two-member commission, led by former High Court judge JN Patel, to investigate the Bhima Koregaon riots. The notification categorically stated that the ""commission of inquiry shall submit the report within four months from the date of its notification"".

Every year, on 1 January, tens of thousands of Dalits across Maharashtra gather at the war memorial of Bhima Koregaon: 40 kilometres from Pune. It commemorates the historic victory a small contingent of Mahar soldiers, over the Peshwas, known for their casteist policies. In 2018, it was the 200th anniversary of the battle. Therefore, the crowd was even larger, and was attacked allegedly by upper caste mobs.

This resulted in severe property damage, injuries and one death. Two men, Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide – both pro-Hindutva leaders –have been accused as conspirators. The victims have also alleged gross police inaction.

The inquiry commission is supposed to investigate the sequence of events, look into whether any individual or group of individuals is responsible for the riots, and whether the administration and police handled it appropriately.

The inquiry commission first sought affidavits from the victims and eyewitnesses and summoned them to testify. The affidavits with the commission are approximately between 350 to 400 from Mumbai and Pune, said Satpute. But 19 months – and a few extensions – later, the inquiry commission has only gotten around to 15 eyewitnesses.

The first deadline had to be extended because the appeal to the victims to submit their affidavits was made over three months after the notification. In a riot where thousands suffered, the commission received around 170 statements in the first month, because hardly anybody was aware of it.

“Many of the affidavits are repetitive,” said Satpute. “For example, if 70 people traveled to Bhima Koregaon in one bus, their testimonies would be identical. So there is no point inviting all of them to testify in front of the commission. Plus, we are giving an opportunity to every lawyer to cross-examine the witnesses in detail. There are six to seven lawyers representing various parties.”

Upon asked how many more eyewitnesses would be summoned, he said, “We cannot say. It will depend on the commission.” The commission has, so far, held about 55 days of hearings since the notification.

Shishir Hiray, special prosecutor for the Government of Maharashtra, said he would be summoning 30 to 35 government office bearers to the commission. “It would include police officers, people from the revenue department, medical officials and so on to prove my case,” he said. “We have not begun with them yet.”

Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant claimed the entire investigation has been a political vendetta. “Certain people are being targeted without evidence,” he said. “The government’s aim is to keep the case lingering and reap political dividends out of it. The Pune Police have misused law, which is unfortunate.”

The Pune Police has arrested 10 rights activists working with Dalit and Adivasi groups, and charged them under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. They have been accused of being part of a Maoist conspiracy, which included a purported plot to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Surendra Gadling and Sudhir Dhawle, two of the arrested, recused themselves from testifying in front of the commission on Friday and Saturday respectively. Both objected to the presence of Sumit Mullick on the inquiry commission.

They said they have no faith in the commission, writing to Justice Patel that Mullick was the chief secretary of the state at the time of Bhima Koregaon riots, where the “police machinery offered no protectio",[],[''],"{'Bhima Koregaon Inquiry Commission', 'Bhima Koregaon Activists', 'Long Reads', 'Coronavirus', 'Bhima Koregaon Accused', 'Fp Exclusives', 'Crypto', 'Coronavirus Outbreak', 'Bhima Koregaon'}",['Updated Date'],2019-09-07 19:39:37+05:30,,,True,2.0,,Another round of the hearing of the Bhima Koregaon Inquiry Commission concluded in Pune after it assembled for two days on 6 and 7 September,en,https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/favicon.ico?v=6.74,https://www.firstpost.com/india/bhima-koregaon-case-accused-activists-refuse-to-depose-before-inquiry-committee-as-latest-round-of-hearings-conclude-in-pune-7302831.html,<Element div at 0x7ef75f0bb450>,<Element div at 0x7ef75f0bb040>,<Element html at 0x7ef75b232310>,<Element html at 0x7ef75b22be00>,{},616f442633e94bb25c66ba22c7697e27.1652448668.3405185,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,03de6cfe-f370-561e-2ea5-ce5a2ae627de,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Mr Hussain left Pakistan in 2012 after his reporting on government corruption, disappearances and human rights violations made him a controversial figure. Pakistani police raided his house, and he began receiving anonymous death threats, leading him to leave the country for Europe.

oi-Deepika S

New Delhi, Oct 22: The Supreme Court on Tuesday set aside the Delhi High Court order granting bail to P Chidambaram, who was arrested by the the Central Bureau of Investigation in INX media case.

""P Chidambaram can be released provided he is not arrested in any other case and on the personal bond of Rs 1 lakh. He has to make himself available for interrogation,"" the SC said in its order.

However, the 74-year-old Congress politician cannot walk out of jail right away. He is also under arrest in a related case being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate and will be under federal agency's custody till October 24.

The Congress leader moved the top court against Delhi High Court order dismissing his bail plea contending that he might influence the witnesses in the case.

Chidambaram, who was also the union home minister during the UPA rule, was arrested by the CBI on August 21 from his Jor Bagh residence.

CBI has recently charge-sheeted him and others, including his son Karti and some bureaucrats, for causing loss to the exchequer by allegedly committing offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code.

Chidambaram is presently in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the INX Media money laundering case.

CBI had lodged an FIR on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in FIPB clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram's tenure as finance minister. Thereafter, ED lodged a money laundering case in 2017.

Thereafter, the ED lodged a money laundering case in this regard in 2017.

The Delhi high court had on August 20, rejected anticipatory bail pleas of Chidambaram in the INX media scam cases lodged by CBI and ED.

INX Media: Chidambaram sought payoff in presence of Mukerjeas and a senior journalist says CBI

The 74-year-old senior Congress leader approached the apex court challenging the September 30 verdict of the high court which had dismissed his bail plea in the INX Media corruption case, filed by the CBI, saying the probe was at an advanced stage and the possibility of his influencing the witnesses cannot be ruled out.

A bench comprising justices R Banumathi, A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy would also pronounce its verdict on the CBI's plea challenging the findings of the high court which had said that Chidambaram was not a 'flight risk' and cannot tamper with the evidence.

Minh City has gone into hiding after he was briefly held and questioned by police for delivering politically sensitive books for a clandestine publishing house.



Vu Huy Hoang, already known to police after an earlier protest against a rise in fuel prices, was detained on Oct. 15 at the police station of Ward 6, District 3, where he was questioned and beaten for 12 hours, Vu told RFA’s Vietnamese Service on Friday.



After being freed, he went into hiding to prevent police harassment of his wife and family, he said.



“I have never considered myself an activist,” said Vu, adding that book delivery is only one of the many jobs he does. “I just do what I can in a very small way to help make this a better society.”



“As a taxi driver, I come into contact every day with people from various walks of life, and I see many things that are unjust,” Vu said.



“This authoritarian regime doesn’t want people to understand anything about democracy or human rights so that they can keep control. They want to hang on to their monopoly on power in order to govern.”



Speaking to RFA, Vu said that a Nov. 30 posting on his Facebook page explaining his reasons for going into hiding had for now stopped authorities’ harassment of his wife, who had been called several times for questioning by the police.



“In fact, I understand how the security agencies work after having to deal with them many times in the past,” he said.



“If you show them a meek face, they will try to dominate you even more. But if you show that you know what they are up to, and take control of the situation, they will step back, do nothing more, or find some other way to talk to you.”



Politically sensitive books



In their questioning, Vu said, police had tried to force him to confess that he works for the Liberal Publishing House, a group that publishes and distributes works considered politically sensitive by the Vietnamese government.



On Feb. 9, 2018, copies of the publishing group’s Politics For Everyone were seized by customs agents in the central coastal city of Danang when they were shipped into the country from abroad.



Dissident blogger Pham Doan Trang, the book’s author, was later detained by security officers who asked her about her book and other activities and held her for 23 hours before returning her to her home under house arrest, fellow activists told RFA in earlier reports.



Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) later awarded Pham its 2019 Press Freedom Prize in absentia, citing her work which “has led to concrete improvements in journalistic freedom, independence and pluralism, or to an increase in awareness of these matters.”



Vietnam has been consistently rated “Not Free” in the areas of internet and press freedom by Freedom House, a U.S.-based watchdog group.



Dissent is not tolerated in the communist nation, and authorities routinely use a set of vague provisions in the penal code to detain dozens of writers and bloggers.



Estimates of the number of prisoners of conscience now held in Vietnam’s jails vary widely, with Human Rights Watch putting the number in October at 138. The rights group Defend the Defenders meanwhile puts the number as at least 240, with 36 convicted this year alone.

then, last week, a judge sentenced a Peruvian journalist to two years in prison and imposed a $100,000 fine following a defamation lawsuit brought by a powerful, wealthy politician.

Media experts called the decision the most direct threat to freedom of expression in Peru in years. And, they said, it was part of a worrying trend across the region — but particularly strong in Peru — in which powerful figures are using the courts to intimidate and punish journalists who investigate them.

“It absolutely sidesteps the fundamental principles of freedom of expression,” Ricardo Uceda, who leads the Press and Society Institute of Peru, said of the ruling.

The politician in this case, César Acuña, is the subject of a book by the journalist, Christopher Acosta, called “Plata Como Cancha,” meaning roughly “Cash by the Bucket.”

In the book, Acosta quotes multiple sources who accuse Acuña, a multimillionaire who ran for president and now heads a political party, of buying votes, misusing public funds and plagiarising. In his decision, the judge in the case, Raúl Jesús Vega, said that nearly three dozen phrases in the book were defamatory.

Rather than address the veracity of the statements, Jesús Vega criticized the journalist for failing, in his assessment, to sufficiently back them up.

The judge also found Jerónimo Pimentel, the director of the book’s publishing house, guilty. And he held Pimentel and the publisher, Penguin Random House in Peru, also responsible for paying the $100,000 fine, which will go to Acuña.

Acosta will not go to prison — many shorter sentences are suspended in Peru — and the parties are appealing the decision.

But the legal action dropped like an anvil on the news media in Peru, with many saying it is sure to have a chilling effect on future reporting.

Acosta, who will likely face a lengthy appeal process, said that he sees the lawsuit coming “not just from a desire to harass a particular journalist, but to send a message to journalists across the country.”

That message was clear, he said: “Look what can happen to you if you mess with me.”

The case involving “Cash by the Bucket” is particularly worrying, said media experts, because in their analysis, Jesús Vega has significantly raised the bar for reporting, suggesting it is not enough to interview and quote several people with knowledge of the matter when making an allegation.

Rather, advocates say, the judge’s language in the sentencing suggests that to be fit for publication, information must have been vetted by an authority, such as a congressional investigation.

But a journalist should not be convicted of defamation if evidence shows that he or she has done due diligence to verify published allegations, said Miguel Jugo, a lawyer for Peru’s national journalism association.

Unlike in the United States and Mexico, where defamation is typically a civil matter, in Peru it is a criminal offense, defined as the act of publicly attributing to another person “a fact, a quality or a conduct that could harm his honour or reputation.”

In the “Cash by the Bucket” case, said Jugo, the judge is claiming that Acosta did not do this due diligence — something that Acosta and many of his allies dispute.

Acosta is the head of investigations at Latina Noticias, an important television channel in Lima. All of the allegations in his book, he told the Committee to Protect Journalists, are direct quotes that came from interviews, news articles, attorney general’s investigations, or legal and congressional testimony.

Other nations in the region have similar laws, said Natalie Southwick at the Committee to Protect Journalists. But, she said, Peru has “seen the most consistent convictions in criminal defamation cases.”

According to Peru’s national journalism association, instances in which the judicial system was used against reporters rose to 29 a year from 18 a year between 2020 and 2018.

These defamation suits come after years of economic growth in Peru that expanded public coffers — and created new opportunities for self-dealing among the ruling class.

In recent years, corruption scandals involving former presidents, judges and lawmakers have fuelled a political free-for-all, with clashes between Congress and the executive branch and mass protests leading the country to cycle through four presidents in the past year.

Journalists have uncovered much of the wrongdoing.

But powerful figures have pushed back, often using the judicial system, and in ma",[],"['Peru', 'Lima', 'Media', 'advocate', 'journalist', 'defamation', 'Acuña', 'Ugaz', 'court', 'critic']","{'Achievement', 'Democracy', 'Cricket', 'Corruption', 'Agriculture', '1971', 'CHT', 'Culture'}","['Julie Turkewitz', 'Mitra Taj', 'The New York Times']",2022-01-20 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,"In Peru, courts ‘used like whips’ to silence journalists",en,https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/favicon.ico,https://bdnews24.com/media-en/2022/01/20/in-peru-courts-used-like-whips-to-silence-journalists,<Element div at 0x7fc13f08f040>,<Element div at 0x7fc13dcb23b0>,<Element html at 0x7fc141a16450>,<Element html at 0x7fc141a16e00>,{},f3d3fc7ce4407d94446b67dd11b54490.1651834614.8103964,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,723e906d-24a3-8786-758b-07cf0d2370e1,2022_01_01-2022_02_28_gdelt_data.csv

Algiers - Boualem Goumrassa

The ongoing demonstrations in Algeria for nearly eight months now have seen a new wave of arrests on Tuesday, mainly targeting university students during their weekly protests.

For the first time in 33 weeks of demonstrations, security forces prevented students from organizing their usual protest on the streets of the capital, bordering the Central University.

Security men were seen baton-wielding protesters, many of whom were taken to police stations to be referred later to prosecution, which often puts them in remanded custody.

Pictures were circulated of students who fainted due to the strong stampede in the demonstrations, following security forces’ attempts to prevent them from advancing in major streets and squares of the capital.

Ambulance activists from the popular movement were also seen helping the injured, some of whom were taken to nearby clinics.

A few days ago, security authorities arrested dozens of protesters, mostly those who can mobilize and recruit, especially leaders of the Youth Action Rally organization, which is close to the Democratic Movement that opposes the power’s policies.

Several journalists were harassed while covering Tuesday’s demonstrations and some were even arrested, such as journalist Mustapha Ben Faudel.

Ben Faudel is a senior journalist for the French-language El Watan newspaper, who in 2014 was known for his activity within the Barakat organization, which opposed former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s running for a fourth term.

Russia Today’s reporter was injured. He wrote on his official Facebook page that he was subjected to physical and verbal abuse and assault by police officers while covering the students’ demonstrations.

He also condemned all forms of attacks against journalists.

Professor of political sociology Nasser Gabi, for his part, said the students’ movement “is witnessing a new era after these arrests in which Algeria will produce its political elites, which have long been awaited.”

Head of the Islamic Justice and Development Front party Abdullah Jaballah commented on the peaceful popular movement saying that it can’t be eliminated because it is not a party, trade union, or any political or social organization’s revolution.

Instead, he wrote, it is a revolution launched by people “who have become desperate of the regime and its justice and decided to start a spontaneous peaceful revolution.”

Beru, a Kurdish adaptation of Dario Fo's 1981 satire Trumpets and Raspberries, was due to open at the city's municipal theatre, marking the first time a Kurdish-language play had been staged in the institution's 106-year history.

News of the banning of the play, due to be performed by the Teatra Jiyana Nu (New Life Theatre) and scheduled to open in the Gaziosmanpasa neighbourhood, arrived just hours before curtain up.

'A member of a terrorist organisation wanted with a red bulletin is free to appear on television and make a statement. [But] it is forbidden, a crime, to stage a play that our citizens who speak Kurdish will go and watch' - Ekrem Imamoglu, Istanbul mayor

Speaking on Twitter, the governor of Istanbul, Ali Yerlikaya, said that the play had been banned because it contained ""PKK propaganda"", rather than because it was in the Kurdish language.

The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) have fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish government that has cost more than 40,000 lives.

""A theatre play spreading the PKK terror organisation's propaganda will be allowed neither in Kurdish, Turkish nor in Arabic,"" Ismail Catakli, a spokesman for the interior ministry, tweeted, dismissing the criticism as ""another lie, another provocation"".

He said legal action had been taken against those who had given it the green light.

Fo's work as a playwright and satirist was honoured in 1997 with the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Beru involves a politician rescued from kidnapping, whose face is mistakenly reconstructed in hospital in the likeness of the man who saved him.

""We were all on stage for rehearsal and ready for the audience but instead were handed a statement from the local administration that we are banned,"" actor Ruges Kirici told AFP outside the theatre, which was under police surveillance.

""We cannot perform at the moment.""

Condemnations

Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu condemned the decision in a statement on Tuesday, implying hypocrisy on the part of the authorities.

“A member of a terrorist organisation wanted with a red bulletin is free to appear on television and make a statement,"" he said.

""[But] it is forbidden, a crime, to stage a play that our citizens who speak Kurdish will go and watch.""

Istanbul is often referred to as the world's largest Kurdish city, as the minority is thought to make up a large percentage of the city's 15-million strong population.

Imamoglu is a member of the opposition Republican People's party (CHP) and won the mayoralty last year. But his power is limited compared to the governor, who is appointed by the government.

The theatre group protested against the ban online, with the Turkish Twitter hashtag #KurtTiyatrosuEngellenemez (""Kurdish theatre cannot be prevented"").

""The play by Dario Fo was performed in many languages all over the world,"" Kirici said. ""Why is it dangerous when it is in Kurdish? Why does it threaten public safety?""

The city theatre - whose history goes back to the Ottoman empire, the predecessor of modern Turkey - had taken on work from independent theatres that are struggling in the coronavirus pandemic.

But it had come under fire since then, with some pro-government media accusing the opposition municipality of allowing a play by a theatre group linked to outlawed Kurdish militants.

Reversal of rights

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) took limited steps to improve the Kurds' cultural and linguistic rights as part of an initiative announced in 2009, when he was prime minister, after decades of severe repression by authorities.

These included allowing Kurdish-language institutions and media outlets, as well as kindergartens that taught children in Kurdish.

Some are dramatic, others highly technical, and a couple could make life easier for voters.

But taken as a whole, the changes add up to one clear result: If the proposals pass, it will become harder — and even, sometimes, legally riskier — to cast a ballot in Texas, a state that already has some of the most restrictive election laws in the country.

Here’s a close look at what’s in the two bills now at the center of the battle over voting rights:

Empowering poll watchersSome of the most significant changes in the Texas legislation concern partisan poll watchers, the volunteers deployed by both major parties to observe voting and counting. As recently as 1962, Republican poll watchers in some parts of Texas challenged Black and Latino voters to read and explain the U.S. Constitution before casting ballots as part of a campaign dubbed “Operation Eagle Eye.” In 2020, then-President Donald Trump cited unverified observations from GOP poll watchers to spread doubt about the results and make false claims of fraud.

The Texas House and Senate bills give partisan poll watchers new access, protections and power. The legislation would make it a crime for an election official to reject a poll watcher who meets the qualifications for the position.

The measures would make it illegal to obstruct a poll watcher’s view, and the Senate bill states that poll watchers are “entitled to sit or stand near enough to hear or see the activity.” Texas law still prohibits poll watchers from watching someone cast a ballot, however.

The legislation empowers poll watchers to sue and seek court orders against election officials who get in their way. The new proposals would also require poll watchers to swear an oath that they will not harass voters.

The House version goes further, preventing poll watchers from being removed for violating election law unless they’ve already been warned. The Texas branch of the American Civil Liberties Union calls this a “one-time get out of jail free card for voter intimidation.”

Republicans argue these changes are needed because voters will only trust elections if their representatives have free access to just about every aspect of voting and counting. But Democrats and civil rights organizations worry about the history of Texas conservatives using poll watchers to intimidate racial and ethnic minority voters.

Limiting opportunities

to vote The laws explicitly roll back ways that Democratic counties have made it easier for people to vote, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. They ban the use of drop boxes for mail ballots, the mailing of absentee ballot applications to all eligible voters, drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting locations. (The House bill makes it a felony for any election official to send out unrequested absentee ballot applications.)

Several of these procedures were used last year in the state’s largest and most racially diverse county, Democratic-leaning Harris County, which is home to Houston. The county says 140,000 people voted in its drive-thru and 24-hour locations in the 2020 election.

Republicans argue that these procedures were used during a once-in-a-century pandemic and shouldn’t be regular features of voting in the state. Democrats and voting rights groups say those measures simply make it easier for people to cast ballots and especially helped working class and younger voters access the polls.

New hurdles to mail votingTexas is already one of the hardest states in the nation in which to vote by mail. The process is limited to those 65 and older, people who will be out of state during the election or people who are disabled. But after Trump objected to mail voting during his failed reelection campaign, Republicans in Texas and elsewhere turned against the method and have been eager to tighten regulations on it.

The Texas bill requires mail voters to include identification numbers on their envelopes and applications that must match data on their voter registration. They’d have to include their driver’s license number — although an expired one would suffice. If they don’t have a driver’s license, they can include the final four digits of their Social Security number.

Opponents of the provision — somewhat similar to one that passed in Georgia — say it is creating another opportunity for voters to make minor mistakes.

New York: A tech-focused civil liberties group on Tuesday sued to block President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks to regulate social media, saying it violates the First Amendment and puts curbs on free speech.

Trump’s order, signed last week, could allow more lawsuits against internet companies like Twitter and Facebook for what their users post, tweet and stream.

The order was more political than substantive, with many experts questioning whether it was constitutional. The president aimed to rally his supporters after Twitter put fact checks on two of his tweets. Trump, without evidence, has long accused tech companies of being biased against conservatives.

The order targets current law — you may have heard recent references to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — that protects internet companies from lawsuits. They can’t be sued for hosting videos and posts from users, or for moderating their services, with some exceptions.

In its suit, the Center for Democracy and Technology said that Trump’s executive order violates the First Amendment because it attacks Twitter for putting the fact checks on the president’s tweets, which CDT said is Twitter’s right as a private company. More broadly, the order is trying to curb speech of all online platforms and people “by demonstrating the willingness to use government authority to retaliate against those who criticize the government,” CDT said.

“The government cannot and should not force online intermediaries into moderating speech according to the president’s whims,” said Alexandra Givens, CDT’s CEO, in an emailed statement. The organization filed the federal suit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.

There was pushback against Trump’s order from various sources. Tech industry groups, unsurprisingly, said it was bad for innovation and speech. Civil rights and libertarian organizations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also criticized Trump’s order.",[],[''],"{'twitter', 'us constitution', 'social media regulation', 'donald trump'}",[],2020-06-03 20:57:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,/AA-Fevicon/fevicon.png,https://www.asianage.com/technology/in-other-news/030620/trump-gets-sued-for-trying-to-clamp-down-on-social-media.html,<Element div at 0x7ff363c18a90>,<Element div at 0x7ff363bf72c0>,<Element html at 0x7ff363c18540>,<Element html at 0x7ff363c18bd0>,{},e4452c48d81d32abf0e161e286ccfd92.1652270512.8638017,gdelt_events,11-05-2022,94ed0957-ccb1-05ae-787a-133f8a1bb1c2,2020_05_01-2020_06_30_gdelt_data.csv

The Death of Truth and Freedom in Hong Kong

Commentary

Right now, across the world, there is a war on truth. The war comes in many forms. More often than not, it comes in the form of misinformation and disinformation campaigns.

To paraphrase U.S. Senator Hiram Warren Johnson, “truth is the first casualty of war.”

Across China, the war on truth has been occurring for decades. However, the effects of this particular war have not been evenly distributed—some regions, and some people, have been hit harder than others. If in doubt, let me point you in the direction of Hong Kong, a place where truth is dying the most painful of deaths.

In the summer of 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) introduced a draconian new law, ostensibly designed to make Hong Kong more secure. In reality, the new law only served to make the city less free, by making it easier for Beijing to punish pro-democracy protesters.

The law, which essentially dealt a killer blow to Hong Kong’s autonomy, was introduced to crack down on acts of subversion—for example, the undermining of the power and authority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Xi Jinping—and terrorism, as well as collusion with foreign or outside forces.

Of course, as many readers already know, the CCP plays loose and fast with definitions. In the eyes of those in Beijing, anyone who strays from the Xi-approved gospel is guilty of subversion.

The new law was announced by Carrie Lam, the fourth and current chief executive of Hong Kong. Although Lam vehemently denies that she is a puppet of Beijing, it’s very difficult to view her in any other light. That’s especially true if you happen to be a member of the press dedicated to exposing the hypocrisy and capriciousness of the CCP.

Puppet on a String

Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization dedicated to safeguarding the right to freedom of information, has labeled Lam a “predator of press freedom.” Lam, we’re told, “has proved to be the puppet of Chinese President Xi Jinping.” Since 2017, when she rose to power (or however much power is granted to her by Beijing) she has openly supported Xi’s “predatory policies towards the media.”

In the summer of 2021, Lam’s support culminated in the closure of Apple Daily, the city’s largest pro-democracy paper. Jimmy Lai, the paper’s founder, along with six of his employees, were charged with conspiracy to produce and distribute seditious material.

Courageous is a word that should be reserved for truly heroic individuals, and Lai, 74, is most definitely courageous. In 2019, when anti-CCP sentiment in the city was at its fiercest, Lai was there, on the streets, actively encouraging people to fight back against Beijing. For this and other “crimes,” Lai was given a 20-month jail sentence.

However, on Dec. 28, prosecutors brought fresh charges against Lai and the aforementioned six employees. According to the South China Morning Post, the new charges allege “that the defendants conspired to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display or reproduce seditious publications.” With these new, trumped-up charges, Lai may very well spend the rest of his life behind bars—all because he had the audacity to speak the truth.

Ever since Lai’s arrest, Lam has been a vocal critic of the much-loved tycoon. Because of this, on the Reporters Without Borders website, the “predator” sits alongside others enemies of press freedom, including Xi Jinping; North Korean leader Kim Jong-un; Russian President Vladimir Putin, a man who has overseen the murder of at least 21 journalists; Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a man who allegedly greenlit the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi; and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, no friend of the press.

In Hong Kong, Lam has played a pivotal role in consigning truth to the trash bin of history. The final nail in the city’s coffin came on Dec. 29, when Stand News, the pro-democracy media outlet, officially shut down.

Like Apple Daily, Stand News was dedicated to delivering the truth—unvarnished and unfiltered.

Regardless of the verdict, Weinstein’s legal problems are far from over.

The producer of “Shakespeare in Love” and “The English Patient” has pleaded not guilty to raping Jessica Mann, a one-time aspiring actress, and sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi. He faces life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.

In addition to the New York case, Weinstein was charged in Los Angeles on Jan. 6, the first day of his Manhattan trial, with sexually assaulting two women.

Weinstein is expected to appear in a Los Angeles court to hear the charges regardless of the New York trial’s outcome, a spokesman for Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey told Reuters. No date has been set for that appearance.

Weinstein, 67, faces up to 28 years in prison if convicted on the Los Angeles charges. Weinstein has said any sexual encounters he had were consensual.

In California, Weinstein is accused of attacking two women on consecutive nights in 2013. One unidentified woman was allegedly raped.

The second woman, model and actress Lauren Young, testified in the New York trial that she was trapped in a bathroom by Weinstein, who groped her while he masturbated.

Young’s claims are not part of the criminal charges against Weinstein in New York. She is one of three women who prosecutors called as witnesses to bolster their case against the former producer by trying to provide evidence of his motives or methods.

Young testified that social media influencer Claudia Salinas stood outside the bathroom door during the attack, which Salinas flatly denied when she was called by the defense.

In addition to the criminal cases, Weinstein is facing civil lawsuits filed by dozens of women for various allegations of sexual harassment or assault.

Many lawsuits also named as defendants The Weinstein Company film studio he founded with his brother Robert. The lawsuits said the company condoned and facilitated the abuse, which it has denied.

A lawyer for Robert Weinstein did not respond to a request for comment.

The company filed for bankruptcy protection and sold its operations in 2018.

Lawyers for many of the women as well as creditors of the company, former board members and insurers have reached a proposed civil settlement worth around $47 million. About $25 million is expected to be available for compensating women who alleged abuse, according to a report by the New York Times.

The agreement would need court approval.

The parties have been trying to finalize the proposed settlement for more than six months. Beth Fegan, the civil lawsuit’s lead lawyer, said in an email to Reuters she expects “to have news by the end of the month.”

Lawyers for seven women, including actress Rose McGowan, who has said she was raped by Weinstein, told Reuters they intend to oppose the settlement.

Several accusers criticized the settlement as low, while also acknowledging the statute of limitations for allegations such as workplace sexual harassment often requires a woman to take action within two years or less. Many alleged incidents happened many years ago, making it difficult to sue, and judges have dismissed claims against board members.

Lawyer Jeff Herman said he hoped women would feel a measure of justice with the criminal trial of Weinstein, regardless of the outcome. The proposed settlement has the support of Herman’s client, actress Kadian Noble, who accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her.

“She thought she won the day we filed a lawsuit,” said Herman. “She thought she would never have a voice.”

A judge at a court in the western city of Oran on Tuesday placed Said Boudour in custody days after his arrest, according to the National Committee for the Release of Detainees, Reuters news agency reported.

On Friday, Front Line Defenders, a Dublin-based human rights group, released a statement calling for Boudour's immediate release.

The group said that in addition to charges of ""undermining the morale of the army"", Boudour was also accused of ""defamation and the spread of fake news"" and ""insulting the regime of Algeria"".

An arrest warrant was issued for Boudour in late September, and he turned himself to the authorities at the Department of National Security in Oran on 6 October, Front Line Defenders said.

The group added that Boudour, who works for online news sites and is a member of the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights, had suffered frequent harassment from the Algerian authorities for his coverage of rights issues in the country.

He was detained for his work once in 2016 and twice in 2018, according to Front Line Defenders.

Officially, demonstrations have been banned in Algeria since 2001 but the prohibition has been ignored since rallies started on 22 February against Algeria's longtime president Abdelaziz Bouteflika's bid for a fifth presidential term.

Bouteflika resigned in April, but protests have continued, as demonstrators continued to demand a total shake-up of the country's political system and call for corrupt officials to be removed from their posts.

Despite the protesters' objections, the head of the Algerian military, Ahmed Gaid Salah, said in early September that presidential elections will be held by the end of the year. Currently they are scheduled for 12 December.

'Arbitrary arrests'

It was unclear if Boudour had participated in protests, but rights groups have accused Algerian authorities of arbitrarily detaining civil society leaders in an attempt to stem the demonstrations ahead of the vote.

Amnesty International said on 19 September that at least 37 students and activists had been arrested since 11 September.

Kim Reynolds said police are seizing enough drugs to kill every American several times over. Is it true?

Gov. Kim Reynolds takes questions about the Iowa State Patrol sent to the southern border and COVID-19, during a news conference, on Wednesday, July 28, 2021, in Des Moines, Iowa. (Kelsey Kremer/The Des Moines Register via AP)

Gov. Kim Reynolds and fellow Republicans have been sounding the alarm about the threats seeping in from our southern border. Foreigners are bringing in drugs that could kill all of us, they warn. But what about our eastern and western borders?

Just beyond U.S. jurisdiction there is a massive volume of a deadly substance. A fraction of what’s out there is enough to kill everyone in the world. Worst of all, it’s not staying in San Francisco or New York City. This stuff can be found in every town in America.

You probably come into contact with this substance everyday and, naively, you don’t even consider the threat. It’s not a street drug or pharmaceutical. It’s two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen — also known as dihydrogen oxide. The ocean is full of more than enough to drown everyone who has ever been born on this planet.

Advertisment

This all probably sounds silly. It’s literally just water. But this is how Reynolds sounds when she talks about fentanyl smuggling.

It’s textbook drug war propaganda, a continuation of the “Reefer Madness” hysteria last century.

Fentanyl madness has been used by Reynolds and others as a justification for the tough-on-crime policies they favor, both at the border and in the rest of the country. It was one of the big reasons she sent state police to the Mexican border this year, although they did not report confiscating any fentanyl on their trip.

“We want to keep it there and not have it filter through to states throughout our country. We do have a role to play in trying to prevent that from coming into Iowa,” Reynolds said in Cedar Rapids last week.

During an interview at The Gazette’s Iowa Ideas conference last week, Reynolds repeated her claim that police in a single year seized enough fentanyl to kill the U.S. population seven times over.

To get to that figure, we have to make a couple big assumptions that turn out to be wrong. We have to assume 2 milligrams of fentanyl is always a lethal dose (it’s not) and that it could be perfectly administered by forcing every American to ingest it (it couldn’t).

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid used both medically and illicitly. Like pretty much every other substance in the world, fentanyl is useful in certain quantities but too much of it potentially is hazardous. Those hazards invariably are overstated by drug prohibitionists.

Drug warriors in the last few years have pushed stories about how just being near fentanyl can knock people unconscious and possibly kill them. It’s textbook drug war propaganda, a continuation of the “Reefer Madness” hysteria last century.

Reynolds’ policy response rests squarely on border enforcement, ignoring everything we know about prohibition, supply and demand. Illicit fentanyl in many cases is a substitute for heroin or prescription opioids. Squeeze its supply and the market will find another alternative.

So, yeah, theoretically cops are confiscating enough drugs to kill every man, woman and child alive. In theory, we also have enough water to drown, enough heavy objects to crush, enough pillows to smother and enough bullets to put one through each of us. It doesn’t make for a very good public safety plan.

Brandon Michael Burt, 19, of Suwanee, Georgia, was booked Monday in the Spartanburg County jail on a charge of third-degree arson, news outlets reported.

Warrants stated Burt is accused of setting a dumpster fire at an apartment complex, WSPA-TV reported.

Burt is also suspected of setting about 20 fires since February on the USC Upstate campus, said Dave Myers, the university’s assistant chief of police. Myers said Burt was named as a person of interest after being spotted near some of the fires, the Spartanburg Herald-Journal reported.

Burt is the only suspect in the campus fires, sheriff’s office spokesman Lt. Kevin Bobo said.

Burt is a sophomore and student-athlete at the university, the newspaper reported. It’s unclear whether he had an attorney who could speak for him.

Arabia has lifted some restrictions on women travelling in the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom, its tourism authority said Sunday, with new guidelines allowing women to rent hotel rooms without a male guardian's presence, and foreign men and women to share a room without proof of marriage.

The easing of stringent regulations governing social interactions comes after Riyadh launched its first tourist visa scheme, as part of efforts to open up the country to foreign visitors and diversify its oil-reliant economy.

The Saudi Commission for Tourism & National Heritage posted the new requirements on Twitter Sunday, confirming a Friday report by the Saudi daily Okaz.

The commission said women will be allowed to rent hotel rooms with proof of identity — an ID card for Saudi women, residency card for foreign residents living in the kingdom or passport for tourists. The same would be required of foreign couples, without the need for them to present a marriage certificate. Previously women needed permission from a male guardian to rent a hotel room.

Women will also be allowed to rent hotel rooms without any form of identification if they have a male guardian present who does have proof of identity, it said.

The move comes amid deep reforms over the past year by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman which has lifted a ban on movie theatres in the kingdom and the world's only ban on women driving.

Critics note there are limits to the reforms, and point to last year's killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the reported torture of several detained women's rights activists.

New visa program

Saudi announced the new tourist visa scheme last week, saying it was aiming to increase tourism to contribute up to 10 per cent of gross domestic product compared to 3 per cent currently. For the launch of its new visa, the country was highlighting five UNESCO World Heritage sites, contemporary art sites and natural sites including the Red Sea, desert and mountains.

Previously visitor visas were issued only for specific reasons such as for Muslim religious pilgrimages, to visit family or for business.

The one-year, multiple-entry visa scheme allows for stays of up to 90 days at a time and marks the first time the country is allowing foreigners to visit solely for the purpose of tourism. Citizens of 49 eligible countries can apply online or on arrival, while those from other countries will have to apply at their nearest Saudi embassy or consulate.

As part of the drive to attract foreign visitors, the kingdom is easing strict dress codes for tourist women, requiring shoulders and knees to be covered in public but not demanding they wear the full-body abaya, according to guidelines posted on its visa information website.",[],[''],set(),['The Associated Press'],,,,True,2.0,,"Saudi Arabia has lifted some restrictions on women travelling in the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom, with new guidelines allowing women to rent hotel rooms without a male guardian's presence, and foreign men and women to share a room without proof of marriage.",en,/a/apple-touch-icon.png,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/saudi-laws-women-travel-hotels-1.5310913,<Element div at 0x7ef753d5cea0>,<Element div at 0x7ef753d6fa90>,<Element html at 0x7ef753dce4f0>,<Element html at 0x7ef753dcee50>,{},df02598c16e9351f3b8eb495645e8786.1652456137.4306316,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,a56fb794-b623-ea36-e021-a1f86985bf7e,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

KUWAIT CITY, Sept 11, (Agencies): The European move to hold talks between the United States and Iran in Kuwait are aimed at easing tensions in the region and exploring opportunities for a comprehensive dialogue between the two belligerent nations – talks that could include the nuclear file as well as the ballistic missile program and Iran’s activities in the region, reports Al-Rai daily quoting sources.

The same sources said the European countries that have signed the nuclear agreement with Iran strongly support negotiations between Washington and Tehran, and believe there is an opportunity based on intensive talks held by these countries separately with the United States and Iran, but the European move is opposed by some countries in the region which say the talks must not be held in Kuwait.

The sources pointed out intensive efforts are being exerted to convince the countries which object the holding of the dialogue in Kuwait, based on latter’s position acceptable to all distinguished Arab, regional and international parties.

Although a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has become a likely option, according to sources, the pursuit of talks between the two countries in Kuwait is not directly linked to the holding of such a summit, because the ‘European trio’ believes that the ground is ready to launch dialogue between the two countries regardless of the level of representation, so any talks in Kuwait can precede or follow the possible meeting between Trump and Rouhani.

Two women who are dual British-Australian citizens and an Australian man have been detained in Iran, one of them sentenced to 10 years in prison, Australia’s government and media said Wednesday. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the families of all three.

The department said it could not comment further due to privacy obligations. The department also urged Australians to follow its travel advice, which includes a warning that foreigners risk arbitrary detention in Iran. A British-Australian blogger and her Australian boyfriend were detained 10 weeks ago while traveling through Asia, The Times newspaper in London reported. A British-Australian academic who studied at Cambridge University and was lecturing at an Australian university was detained separately and sentenced to 10 years in prison, the newspaper reported.

The newspaper said she was being held in solitary confinement but it did not know what she had been convicted of doing. The lecturer has been behind bars for almost a year, Australian Broadcasting Corp reported.

The Australian government, the newspaper and the ABC have not released names. The three are held in Tehran’s Evin prison, where British Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, has been detained since 2016 on spying charges, the newspaper reported.

The women are thought to be the first British passport holders who do not also have Iranian nationality to have been imprisoned by Tehran in recent years, the newspaper said. The blogger was being held in the same ward for female political prisoners as Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the newspaper reported.",[],[''],set(),['Arab Times'],2019-09-11 19:58:19+00:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/file/2015/09/57.png,http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/europe-moves-for-us-iran-talks-in-kuwait-says-daily/,<Element div at 0x7ef7591c3090>,<Element div at 0x7ef7591c3c70>,<Element html at 0x7ef7591ae040>,<Element html at 0x7ef7591ae590>,{},64f0b64d1a0f5c69450a1760d0444467.1652449689.9164214,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,724a3c11-3f51-6286-b84a-dbc0ef199adc,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Daylin Leach has filed a defamation suit against the Philadelphia Inquirer and one of its reporters for allegedly colluding with a woman to make public false accusations of prior sexual misconduct in what he called a “smear campaign.”

“Clouded by the desire to drive Senator Leach from office by any means necessary, (reporter Angela) Couloumbis and the Inquirer exploited the trust of their readers by staging the release of knowingly false and defamatory stories under the guise of a ‘fair report’ and have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their own involvement therein in violation of the central tenets of ethical journalism,” according to the complaint filed in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Wednesday by attorney Joe Podraza Jr.

“The allegations are untrue,” said Couloumbis when contacted for comment Thursday.

Gabriel Escobar, editor and vice president of the Philadelphia Media Network, said the paper stands by its reporting and would not comment further on pending litigation.

Leach, D-17 of Lower Merion wo also represents portions of Delaware County, has been the frequent subject of unflattering news articles since December 2017, when some female campaign workers alleged his behavior included “sexualized talk and improper touching.”

Leach withdrew from a Congressional race shortly thereafter, but has adamantly denied the allegations and continued to serve in the state Senate despite calls from fellow legislators and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf to resign.

Then Cara Taylor circulated a private complaint in January 2019 amongst other senators and accused Leach of coercing her to perform oral sex on him in 1991, when she was 17 years old.

Leach filed a defamation suit that same month against Taylor and two other women – Gwen Snyder of Philadelphia and Colleen Kennedy of Havertown – in which he described Taylor as an “admitted liar and notorious perjurer,” who falsely testified at her mother’s trial that she, not her mother, had attempted to kill her stepfather. Taylor later pleaded guilty to charges of felony perjury and false swearing.

Leach was additionally the subject of an independent investigation performed by the firm Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott LLC for the Senate Democratic Caucus concerning the 2017 allegations. The attorneys concluded in a recent report that Leach “engaged in joking and humor that was immature and unprofessional,” but “at no time did any such behavior actually create a hostile work environment” and nothing criminal had taken place.

Leach now claims Couloumbis and the Inquirer initially investigated Taylor’s claims in 2018, but the paper declined publishing her account due to the “physical and temporal impossibilities” of some of her allegations, as well as fears of exposure to defamation liability.

The complaint alleges Couloumbis thereafter conspired with Taylor to stage the circumstances in which the paper could maintain a “fair reporting” privilege by indirectly reporting on Taylor’s claims. This included prodding Taylor to seek an official pardon for her perjury conviction and urging her to circulate her private criminal complaint in the state Senate, according to the suit.

Leach additionally points to a May 2019 Inquirer article written by another reporter who is not a defendant in the suit that he says mischaracterized his initial defamation suit against Taylor, Snyder and Kennedy as a “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation,” or “SLAPP” suit designed to silence detractors.

Leach claims the aim of that article was to influence the court into dismissing his claims as meritless and preclude further discovery that would expose the Inquirer’s alleged role in Taylor’s accusations. The judge overseeing the case denied preliminary objections filed by Snyder and Kennedy in July and the suit is still pending.

“Put simply, rather than reporting the news objectively, Couloumbis and the Inquirer helped stage the widespread dissemination of false information against Senator Leach to advance their own subjective biases, to increase the paper’s sales and profits and, later, to cover their tracks,” the complaint says.

Leach says he has suffered stress, anguish, embarrassment, and harm to his personal and professional reputation as a result. He is seeking compensatory damages in excess of $50,000.",[],[''],{'Coronavirus'},['Alex Rose'],2019-10-03 16:52:00+00:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,https://www.delcotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DelcoTimes-siteicon.png?w=16,https://www.delcotimes.com/news/article_88be93f0-e630-11e9-b1b0-f7d483e512a3.html,<Element div at 0x7ef7542bcea0>,<Element div at 0x7ef7542a5a40>,<Element html at 0x7ef7542b6ea0>,<Element html at 0x7ef7542b6270>,{},0b2a32be4b21396fe809a6425f4f2571.1652455573.7083404,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,3d232823-2347-948e-aef0-76428d283092,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

9 a.m. Dec. 1: North Pacific Seafoods Inc. released a statement saying the Seattle-based company works hard to maintain excellent working and living conditions for all employees.

“The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority,” the Nov. 25 statement reads.

Hundreds of employees, including one of the two named plaintiffs in the recently filed lawsuit, choose to return to work for North Pacific Seafoods year after year for multiple seasons, the company said, including at the Red Salmon seafood plant in Naknek that’s referenced in the suit.

“We regularly evaluate conditions at our facilities as part of our continuous quality improvement efforts. We also have numerous, confidential channels employees or others may use to notify us of any potential concerns about our operations, working conditions or employee living arrangements.

“While we are unable to comment on the details of this pending litigation brought by two former seasonal employees, we can tell you the claims made in that lawsuit are not accurate. North Pacific Seafoods will vigorously fight these inaccurate allegations through the legal process.”

The statement notes that California plaintiffs’ attorneys filed the class-action lawsuit months after the salmon season ended and after the two named plaintiffs had already returned to their homes.

That eliminated North Pacific Seafoods’ ability to address any potential questions or concerns in a timely manner.

“Instead, the plaintiffs’ attorneys appear more interested in financial compensation than working conditions,” according to the company.

Original story:

Hundreds of Alaska-based seafood employees were forced to endure filthy, unsafe working conditions — including rat-infested bunkhouses — and stiffed on wages daily, according to a class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle in October.

North Pacific Seafoods, Inc. shorted workers of wages owed last summer by requiring they punch a timeclock only after they donned and doffed protective gear, a lengthy process that involves rubber aprons, boots, multiples sets of gloves, hairnets, earplugs and other safety equipment, the lawsuit alleges.

Headquartered in Seattle, North Pacific Seafoods is a subsidiary of Marubeni Corp, a multi-billion-dollar Japanese conglomerate. The company will not comment on pending litigation, said Leauri Moore, vice president of human resources and administration. North Pacific Seafoods operates multiple processing plants in key Alaska fishing communities including Kodiak, Sitka, Togiak and Naknek. The company controls about 10 percent of the Alaska fisheries market, according to the lawsuit.

The company flies in as many as 800 seasonal workers to clean, fillet, package, freeze and can fish at its Alaska plants. Many of the workers are from Mexico and Central America, plaintiff attorneys said.

Before being cleared to clock in, workers at the Red Salmon plant in Naknek would typically spend 10 to 15 minutes donning gear and another 10 minutes waiting to be checked in, one by one, according to the complaint by Erickson Kramer Osborne, a California-based law firm. The workers’ paid shift would not begin until they completed this process.

At the end of their shifts, often running 16 hours, they would punch out. But that was before removing their soiled rubber aprons and gloves, discarding their hair nets and ear plugs, and washing their boots and gloves, a 10 to 15-minute process.

“Workers were not paid for 30 to 50 minutes of time spent under company control each day,” according to the complaint.

For workers at the bottom of the pay scale, this meant losing “hundreds of dollars each month.”

Similar pay conditions were in place at each of Northern Pacific Seafoods’ plants in Alaska, not just at the Red Salmon facility, according to the complaint.

Rodents and sewage odors

North Pacific Seafood offers free food and lodging, but the lawsuit paints a Kafkaesque picture of the living conditions.

Several workers had to beat their mattresses to scare away rats.

“One entered his rooms to find a rat had given birth to a litter of pups and was nursing on his bed linens,” according to allegations in the complaint.

Besides rodent-infested dormitory rooms, workers frequently encountered the stench of mold. The mold fumes were so strong in the bathroom, “workers held their breath while using it.”

Tap water was often murky and smelled like fish.

CARLYLE, Ill. (AP) — Police have arrested a Kentucky man in connection with the fatal shooting of an eastern Illinois deputy early Wednesday and a carjacking in neighboring Missouri a couple of hours later.

An Illinois State Police SWAT team arrested Ray Tate, 40, of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on Wednesday afternoon at a home in Carlyle where Tate allegedly committed a home invasion and took the homeowner hostage in addition to the carjacking victim, police said.

Tate was charged with murder by the Wayne County State’s Attorney and lodged in the Clinton County Jail.

Neither the carjacking victim nor the home invasion victim was injured, police said.

No other suspect was being sought, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

The Wayne County, Illinois, Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post that Deputy Sean Riley responded to a motorist assist call on Interstate 64 near Mill Shoals around 5 a.m. Wednesday. A second officer who arrived at the scene found Riley dead. The deputy's squad car was later found abandoned on I-64.

The search for the suspect extended to St. Peters, Missouri, where police believe a man involved in a shooting and carjacking shortly after 7 a.m. Wednesday at a QuikTrip convenience store was the same person who killed the deputy.

St. Peters police spokeswoman Melissa Doss said in an email that “there was evidence at the QuikTrip scene which indicates the suspect was also involved in the series of crimes which occurred in Illinois earlier this morning.” She declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.

St. Peters police said the man drove away from the convenience store in a car that was later found near Interstate 70 in nearby O'Fallon, Missouri. The suspect then stole a white pickup truck, police said.

Carlyle is 47 miles (76 kilometers) east of St. Louis.",[],[''],set(),[],,,,True,2.0,,,en,https://infotel.ca/favicon.ico?v=1,https://infotel.ca/newsitem/us-deputy-killed-illinois/cp32352606,<Element span at 0x7f4b4fdd1bd0>,<Element span at 0x7f4b4fdc7720>,<Element html at 0x7f4b4fdd1540>,<Element html at 0x7f4b4fdd1680>,{},0837625fd4a2b852ced6fb0366800eee.1651853648.6246026,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,40eae833-cef6-e0de-c7f9-10f04acbb179,2021_11_01-2021_12_31_gdelt_data.csv

stabbed two men in Bangladesh’s capital, including a gay rights activist who also worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development, police said, in the latest in a series of attacks targeting atheists, moderates and foreigners.

Police said they suspected radical Islamists in the attack, which occurred two days after a university professor was hacked to death. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

The victims were identified as USAID employee Xulhaz Mannan, who previously worked as a U.S. Embassy protocol officer, and his friend, Tanay Majumder, according to Mohammed Iqbal, a police officer in Dhaka’s Kalabagan area. Mannan also was an editor of Bangladesh’s first gay rights magazine, Roopbaan.

The U.S. ambassador condemned the murder, just weeks after the U.S. government and numerous rights groups called on the government of the Muslim-majority country to better protect its citizens and secure free speech.

“I am devastated by the brutal murder of Xulhaz Mannan and another young Bangladeshi this evening in Dhaka,” U.S. Ambassador Marcia Bernicat said in a statement. “Xulhaz was more than a colleague to those of us fortunate to work with him at the U.S. Embassy. He was a dear friend.”

According to a man who told local broadcaster Somoy TV that he had witnessed the attack, at least five young men took part in the killing and chanted “Allahu Akbar,” or “Allah is Great” as they left the scene.

Bangladesh’s government has blamed radical Islamists in the country, though the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for some of the murders, including the killing Saturday of university professor Rezaul Karim Siddique in a northwestern city.

Government officials dismissed the claim, insisting that the extremist group has no presence in the South Asian country.

Bangladesh has been riven by a wave of deadly attacks on foreigners, religious minorities and secular bloggers, raising fears that religious extremists are gaining a foothold in the country, despite its traditions of secularism and tolerance.

The U.S. government has said it is considering granting refuge to a select number of secular bloggers facing imminent danger in Bangladesh.

“We abhor this senseless act of violence and urge the government of Bangladesh in the strongest terms to apprehend the criminals behind these murders,” Bernicat said in her statement.",[],[''],"{'Bangladesh', 'U.S. ambassador', 'gay rights activist', 'International Development'}",['Wire Report'],2016-04-27 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,https://www.watermarkonline.com/wp-content/themes/Wmrk-Azurite.Pro/images/branded/FB-Watermark.jpg,https://watermarkonline.com/2016/04/27/gay-rights-activist-magazine-editor-stabbed-death-extremist-attack/,<Element div at 0x7f4b75db53b0>,<Element div at 0x7f4b773b2130>,<Element html at 0x7f4b74312b30>,<Element html at 0x7f4b74312d10>,{},8b232f62406da2add01308e7963735f0.1652004706.205992,gdelt_events,08-05-2022,503a485f-e021-08ed-4236-15d2f0675f5f,2021_09_01-2021_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Communist authorities in China have abducted and tortured a 46-year-old priest in the southeastern province of Fujian for refusing to join the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, according to reports.

Father Liu Maochun from the Diocese of Mindong was ruthlessly tortured, according to Bitter Winter, a magazine that reports on religious liberty and human rights in China.

Officers banged a “gong beside his ear and shone a bright light into his eyes for several consecutive days—a torture method known as ‘exhausting an eagle’ when people are deprived of sleep for a long time,” the magazine said, quoting a source in the diocese.

Liu Maochun, who assists the diocese’s auxiliary bishop Guo Xijin, was taken away by police on Sept. 1 while he was visiting patients in a hospital. He was reportedly taken to a detention house in the county-level city of Fu’an.

“The government claimed that Fr. Liu Maochun has disobeyed its rule and was ‘ideologically radical,’” the source was quoted as saying.

Bishop Guo had also refused to join the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. The government earlier pressured a deacon in the diocese, threatening to demolish his house and sack his children if he further supported Guo’s refusal to join the Patriotic Church, the magazine said.

An insider in the Fu’an city government told the magazine that the authorities suspect that Fr. Maochun may have shared information with foreign media about another priest, Fr. Huang, who too was tortured for not joining the Patriotic Church.

China has an estimated 12 million Catholics and two major groupings, those registered with the state-controlled Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and an underground church of Catholics, who reject state control, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The Vatican signed an agreement with China in 2018 on the leadership of the Catholic Church, after which tensions between the authorities and diocesan priests increased. The Vatican is now seeking to renew that agreement, overlooking concerns over religious freedom and human rights.

Christian human rights groups and some Catholic bishops have voiced their concerns with the Vatican’s decision. While certain details of the deal remain unknown, reports of the agreement indicate that Chinese officials submit a candidate for bishop to the Vatican and the pope has final say over the matter.

Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a United Nations-accredited persecution watchdog, has also signaled its concerns about the deal.

“CSW is deeply concerned about the timing of this provisional agreement between the Chinese government and the Vatican,” CSW’s East Asia team leader, Benedict Rogers, said in a statement. “While we understand some of the motivations behind the Vatican's effort toward an agreement, there are significant concerns about the implications for freedom of religion or belief in China.”

Rogers added that if the agreement was to have “real value,” the deal itself must have freedom of religion or belief as one of its central components. “We reiterate our call on the Chinese authorities to release all Catholics in China held in any form of detention, and all others detained in connection with their peaceful religious activities.”

China has been cracking down on underground churches and Christian activists for years.

In 2015, more than 1,000 crosses were removed from church roofs and entire church buildings were destroyed across the Zhejiang province.

The Chinese government continued its campaign against Christianity during the country’s coronavirus outbreak by destroying crosses and demolishing a church while people were on lockdown.

A yet-to-be identified retired Major-General has reportedly been arrested by the police in Abia State for alleged arms dealing.

Although the name of the Army General was not mentioned, it was gathered that several arms including AK47 rifles, pump action and pistols were among the guns recovered from him and members of his syndicate.

Speaking at the command headquarters in Umuahia, Police Commissioner Ene Okon, while parading about 17 suspects arrested for offences, including a kidnap kingpin, said the police have launched a manhunt for other members of the syndicate in an attempt to recover guns sold to some buyers.

Okon, who said that the Nigeria Police was ready to ensure that Abians enjoyed a crime-free Christmas, added that operatives of Anti-robbery Squad (SARS), under the command, acting on a tip- off, demolished a hard drug hideout at Isiala Ngwa North Local Government operated by two well-known indigenes of the area.

He said that 10 persons were arrested with large quantities of hard drugs.

Okon, while listing the achievements of the command under his leadership, said that 127 persons were arrested for armed robbery, 144 for kidnapping, five for arms dealing, 150 for cultism, 20 for motorcycle snatching, while the police rescued 79 kidnapped victims from February to date.

He said 88 vehicles, 120 firearms and 528 ammunition were recovered during the period in review, adding that 658 suspects have been arraigned.",[],[''],set(),[],2019-12-17 03:10:21+01:00,,,True,2.0,,The Nation Newspaper Retired General arrested in Abia for ‘arms dealing’,en,https://nation-media-assets.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12140214/cropped-nation-cropped-l-32x32.jpg,https://thenationonlineng.net/retired-general-arrested-in-abia-for-arms-dealing/,<Element div at 0x7f20c25178b0>,<Element div at 0x7f20c95eb0e0>,<Element html at 0x7f20c95eb770>,<Element html at 0x7f20c95eba90>,{},e29ccadfd12fd1d2ce106873c22492bc.1652436304.0538914,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,45a997f0-4ae6-303a-bb6e-efa37b98570e,2019_11_01-2019_12_31_gdelt_data.csv

Wednesday - Reuters TV - Reuters TV

Boris Johnson has refused to deny there was a Christmas party held at No 10 last year while lockdown curbs were in place – but claimed all Covid rules were followed.

Challenged by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs over the festive bash for Downing Street staff, the prime minister said: “All guidance was followed completely.”

The Labour leader said: “The prime minister doesn’t deny there was a Downing Street Christmas party last year ... He says no rules were broken. Both of those things can’t be true. He’s taking the British public for fools.”

Sir Keir quoted from the “clear” Covid rules in place when London was under tier 3 restrictions, which stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party.”

He added: “Does the prime minister really believe that while the country was banned from seeing loved ones at Christmas last year, it was fine for him and his friend to throw a boozy party at Downing Street?”

The Daily Mirror reported that Mr Johnson gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a senior aide last November when the country was in the midst of the second lockdown.

The newspaper said members of his No 10 team then held their own festive party in the days before Christmas while London was under tier 3 restrictions.

In each case there was reportedly 40 or 50 people crammed “cheek by jowl” into a medium-sized room. “It was a Covid nightmare,” one source claimed, while another said there were “many social gatherings” at No 10 at the height of the second lockdown.

One partygoer at the 18 December event later told the BBC there were “several dozen” people there, that food and drink were served, games played – and then it went on past midnight.

Grilled over the Downing Street party at the start of PMQs on Wednesday, Mr Johnson deflected and urged Sir Keir to follow current guidance when he holds his own party on 15 December “to which he’s unaccountably failed to invite the deputy leader [Angela Rayner]”.

The Labour leader responded: “Nice try, but that won’t work,” before going on to question the refusal of some Conservative MPs to wear masks in the Commons.

“As for following the rules, prime minister – it might be worth looking behind you when it comes to the question of masks,” said Sir Keir. “As ever, one rule for them, one rule for everybody else.”

It was reported that the official No 10 staff party was cancelled but that the leaving do still took place on 27 November, while an unofficial Christmas party was held on 18 December. Mr Johnson did not attend the latter event, it was claimed.

A Downing Street source did not deny that parties had taken place, telling reporters only: “We don’t recognise this account. At all stages the rules have been followed.”

Leading barrister Adam Wagner, an expert on Covid restrictions, said rules were “probably broken” at the 18 December gathering if 40 to 50 people did attend.

“At the time (Tier 3), you could only have gatherings over 30 indoors if they were a ‘permitted organised gathering’, but that would require households not mingling, or if ‘reasonably necessary for work’,” he tweeted.

“But a Christmas party was very unlikely to be ‘reasonably necessary for work’ … I think that purely social gatherings which weren’t e.g. combined with work meetings – like a Christmas party – weren’t ‘reasonably necessary’.”

Earlier on Wednesday, health secretary Sajid Javid said “all rules would have been followed” if there had been parties in the run-up to last Christmas.

Questioned on LBC, Mr Javid said: “I don’t know who attended these parties – but I don’t even think there were parties, that I’m aware of.”

The Bulawayo based Chronicle, a member of the Zimpapers media group, reported on Thursday that Ndebele had been arrested for allegedly raping an A Level pupil from a school in Kezi in Matabeleland South.

The paper further reported that the pupil had fallen pregnant from the sexual assault.

However, party youth leader Discent Collins Bajila refuted reports that Ndebele had been arrested.

“Hon Anele Ndebele has not been arrested. He has not been informed by police of allegations leveled against him,” said Bajila.

The report mentions that authorities harassed and at times, prosecuted human rights defenders and journalists for criticising government policies. The government has also deployed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the country's anti-corruption watchdog, to detain political opponents and critics of the government, including the Dawn editor Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman, who was held without bail for six months.

""Pakistan's continuing assault on political opponents and free expression put the country on an increasingly dangerous course... Threatening opposition leaders, activists, and journalists who criticise the government is a hallmark of authoritarian rule, not a democracy,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.



Furthermore, the report highlights worsening violence against Pakistan's Ahmadiyya community in 2020, with at least four Ahmadis killed for alleged incidents of blasphemy. It also noted that the government failed to amend or repeal blasphemy law provisions, which have led to arbitrary arrests and prosecutions and has provided a 'pretext for violence' against religious minorities.

Several leading women journalists had issued a statement in August, where they had condemned the ""well-defined and coordinated campaign"" of social media attacks, including death and rape threats, against women journalists and commentators whose views and reporting have been critical of the government.

In September, a Lahore police chief made a public statement suggesting that a woman, who had been gang-raped on a highway in Punjab, was herself at fault because she should not have been ""travelling without her husband's permission"" on a motorway late at night.

In addition, data from domestic violence helplines across Pakistan have indicated that cases of domestic violence increased by 200 per cent from January-March 2020, and further worsened during the Covid-19 lockdowns after March. Partial or complete Covid-19 lockdowns to prevent the spread of infection also had a disproportionate effect on women workers, especially home-based and domestic workers. (ANI)

The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 100,000 refugees at the U.S.-Mexico border in February, the 10th consecutive month of increased apprehensions and a return to levels last seen in mid-2019, according to the Pew Research Center.

During a hostile grilling in a House committee hearing Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas predicted the southwest border was on pace to see more refugees than in the past 20 years.

Mayorkas said the department was reactivating detention facilities in Texas and Arizona, and deploying FEMA to help care for the overwhelming number of migrant children flooding the border until they can be returned or placed with sponsors.

The border is not open — most single adults and families who cross illegally are expelled to Mexico. Migrants shut out by former President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy are making perilous journeys out of hope — desperately fleeing conditions in Central America unimaginable to most Americans.

Thousands are sending their children to the United States in hope they will have a better chance of asylum. About 8,500 children are being held too long in facilities in South and West Texas — in conditions where no one, especially children, should stay, especially during a pandemic.

Transformation is messy, and while there are no quick fixes, progress must be swift.

Yet the familiar political rhetoric is deterring progress. Arguing on Twitter and during a congressional hearing about whether it should be called a crisis or a disaster, incorrectly stating that President Joe Biden opened the border, making border visits that are more political theater than substantive, and holding news conferences to complain and blame are not helpful.

“This is more than a crisis,” Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters in El Paso, where he and others toured a detention facility. “This is a human heartbreak.”

Indeed. But this isn’t the first surge, and there is plenty of blame to share.

Like many Republicans, McCarthy did not express outrage in 2019 when a record number of migrant children — almost 70,000, many unaccompanied — were held in U.S. custody, according to the Associated Press. There wasn’t a word of concern from Gov. Greg Abbott or Sen. Ted Cruz or others who are now speaking so loudly.

Where was the outrage then? Where was their anger when in 2020 it was widely reported that the parents of 545 children who were separated at the border could not be found? Was their indignation and concern for migrants muted because a Republican was in the White House?

Referring to a “Biden border crisis,” McCarthy said terrorists were trying to cross into the United States via Mexico — a claim Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., chairman of the House subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations called “wrong or a lie,” according the Washington Post.

A day after lifting COVID-19 restrictions, Abbott accused migrants of spreading the virus and then refused FEMA reimbursement for the testing and quarantine of immigrants.

Immigration has been broken for decades and we need a bipartisan effort for systematic change. And while perfection is impossible, the Biden administration should have been more prepared for the surge.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, said the border is always a politicized issue: “There are some in politics who use the surge to paint the idea that there are a bunch of brown people coming here to hurt Americans; that is not the case — these are desperate people trying to flee desperate situations.”

Enough with the partisan bickering and lies. If concern about the border is genuine, then get to work on comprehensive reform, including substantive relief to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.

Roberta Jacobson, Biden’s coordinator for the southern border, shared the administration’s plan to “seek $4 billion over four years to address the root causes of migration — including corruption, violence and economic devastation exasperated by climate change.”

We can’t build a better immigration system — one that exemplifies humanity and security — with rote partisan responses.",[],[''],set(),"['Express-News Editorial Board', 'Guillermo Contreras', 'Vincent T.

After 17 days in detention, the police charged a journalist, Rotimi Jolayemi, also known as Oba Akewi, for acting in a manner that can cause ‘annoyance’ and ‘hatred’ for the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.

The development comes less than five days after Mohammed through his spokesman, Segun Adeyemi, denied being the mastermind behind the arrest of the Vice-Chairman, Freelance and Independent Broadcasters Association of Nigeria, Osun State chapter.

In the charge sheet marked, FHC/ABJ/CB/104/2020, the police alleged that Jolayemi on April 14 shared an audio file in a WhatsApp group, which subsequently went viral.

In the charge sheet signed by the Prosecuting Counsel, Prosecution Section, Joseph Offor, the police said the act was in contravention of Section 24(1)(b) of the Cybercrimes Act 2015.

The charge read, “That you, Jolayemi Oba Akewi, male, aged 43, on or about the 14th day of April 2020 at Osolo Compound Ekan Nla, Kwara State, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court did send audio message through your Android phone device to a group WhatsApp platform known as ‘Ekan Sons and Daughters’ and which went viral immediately after it was posted for the purpose of causing annoyance, insult, hatred and ill will toward the current Minister of Information and Culture, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 24(1)(b) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention etc) Act 2015.”

The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights said during the week that Jolayemi was being illegally detained at the Federal Investigation Bureau of the Nigeria Police Force, Abuja, for reciting a poem on air critical of the minister.

CDHR said in a statement by its National President, Osagie Obayuwana, on Monday that when the journalist failed to turn himself in, his wife, Dorcas, and his brothers – John Jolayemi and Joseph Jolayemi – were all detained in Kwara State.

While condemning the act, the organisation said the detention was in contravention of Section 35 of the 1999 Constitution.

The statement read in part, “Jolayemi is said to have been arrested by the police at the instance of the Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on account of a poem read on radio, considered critical of the minister.

“It is worrisome that Alhaji Lai Mohammed would have a hand in the arrest of the wife of Mr Jolayemi, Mrs. Dorcas Jolayemi, and two of his brothers who were kept in detention for eight days, nine days and two days respectively as hostages, while the journalist was being sought.

“Furthermore, that even since Jolayemi surrendered himself to the police headquarters at Ilorin on May 6, he is still being held till date, 12 days later, without being charged or granted bail.”

The CDHR said detaining the journalist’s relatives because of his refusal to show up was in violation of Section 7 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, which forbids hostage-taking and the arrest of any person in place of another.

Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, did not respond to calls.

“Our officers are working hard,” said Buske, who had been out of state for a medical procedure. “And I think this is a perfect example of [how] when someone doesn’t do what they’re supposed to do, they are going to face the consequences like anyone else would.”

Rawls, 47, was booked into jail Wednesday after turning himself in on the charge, and he bailed out the same day on a $4,000 bond.

According to the Texas Rangers, officers responded to a reported fight between Rawls and another man at a fundraising event at 506 W. 26th St. just before 11 p.m. Feb. 8. Rawls was off duty at the time, officials said.

Several witnesses told authorities Rawls hit a man multiple times with a closed fist and that the man did not attempt to fight back. The victim had an abrasion to the top of his head, a black eye, bruising to his left cheek, a broken finger and bruising to the right side of his torso, a report notes.

Officials said Rawls reported to police that the victim had touched Rawls’ face, which provoked his reaction. Witnesses told authorities the victim did nothing to initiate the altercation.

At Friday’s press conference, Buske said Bryan police officers responded to the scene shortly after the alleged altercation and followed investigatory protocol.

“Our instructions to them was to gather whatever evidence needed to be gathered, and what [couldn’t] be re-created,” he said.

Following the arrest, departmental leadership opted to have the Texas Rangers conduct a criminal investigation, in order to promote transparency and avoid any conflicts of interest within the Bryan Police Department.

Rawls is on paid administrative leave. Buske said the department can not withdraw payment of an officer placed on leave until a formal charge has been filed, which has not yet happened.

Rawls received his police officer commission in 1995 and was hired by the Bryan Police Department in 1996. Harris County court records show that in November 1991, then 18-year-old Rawls was arrested on a charge of assault. The case was disposed two years later under the process of deferred adjudication, which allows a defendant to accept responsibility for a crime without a conviction being placed on record, according to written testimony for the Texas Senate Jurisprudence Committee. Court records show Rawls served one year of probation for the offense in 1991 and paid a $100 court fine.

Buske said Friday that Rawls was qualified to become a police officer, despite the charge.

“It was discovered by our background investigators through that time frame, and he does not have a conviction for assault,” Buske said.

Buske said the department will be looking more into the nature of Rawls’ employment.

“There is a second internal investigation being conducted by our professional standards division,” he said. “This investigation operates under civil service rules and looks at whether or not there were violations related to a person’s employment.”",[],"['eric buske', 'officer', 'criminal law', 'law', 'crime', 'police', 'rawls', 'assault', 'bryan', 'arrest', 'wayland rawls']",set(),"['Rebecca Fiedler Rebecca.Fiedler Theeagle.Com', 'Rebecca Fiedler', 'Michael Miller The Eagle', 'Brazos County Judicial Records']",,,,True,2.0,,"Bryan police Chief Eric Buske spoke to the media Friday on the recent arrest of Wayland Rawls, an assistant chief charged with misdemeanor assault in connection to a Feb. 8",en,https://theeagle.com/content/tncms/site/icon.ico,https://theeagle.com/news/local/bryan-police-chief-addresses-rawls-arrest/article_f35ff970-5538-11ea-a316-fb256e688701.html,<Element div at 0x7f209fd55180>,<Element div at 0x7f209fd59950>,<Element html at 0x7f209fd9e0e0>,<Element html at 0x7f209fd3e9f0>,{},c8b636f05413c0bc419b318087cb95b2.1652374159.1941388,gdelt_events,12-05-2022,c6ea079a-7aa1-698c-cff0-8e574f93ef82,2020_01_01-2020_02_29_gdelt_data.csv

The Nigdi police, on a request from Haryana police, arrested a 26-year-old local resident who is accused of extorting a woman from the northern state, after befriending her on Facebook and entering into a sexual relationship with her. He was using videos he'd made of their sexual interludes to blackmail, threatening to upload them on social media and also doing as much on several occasions, before deleting them after she coughed up a bank transfer. Pursuant to his arrest on Friday night, the man has been handed over the Haryana police.



Rakesh Diparam Saharan, a native of Rajasthan, who ran a transport business at Nigdi, befriended the 25-year-old victim from Haryana, in 2018 on Facebook. As the relationship developed he offered to go over to the victim's place to seek her parents' consent to marry her. Then on November 14, 2019, well aware that the woman was home alone, he visited her and used a hidden camera to record their sexual act.



This was the beginning of several months of the physical relationship, before the accused started blackmailing the woman. When she refused to concede to his demand, he uploaded one of the videos he'd taken, on social media. Shocked, the woman relented, making a bank transfer to the accused's account. The video was taken offline after this was done. This exercise of uploading and removing the video after the woman paid up, was repeated about five to six times, before she got frustrated enough to approach the cops. She filed a complaint at Yamunanagar police station of Haryana.



Speaking on the case, Laxman Sonawane, assistant police inspector at Nigdi police station, told Mirror, ""The Haryana police arrived in Pune on December 31 and approached us. We shared the accused's photo with our informer, who later tipped us off on his whereabouts. The accused has an office at Nigdi and that is where we arrested him from. On being nabbed, he confessed to his crime, admitting that he deliberately befriended the woman on the pretext of marrying her in due course. Instead he took those videos of the victim and pumped her for money. The woman has transferred Rs 1.35 lakh to the accused to date, but he was demanding Rs 10 lakh. A case has been registered in Haryana, under sections 376 (rape), 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.""

commuted the prison sentence of his longtime ally Roger Stone, shielding the veteran Republican operative from 40 months behind bars.

""Roger Stone is now a free man!"" the White House said in a statement, days before he was to report to a federal prison to start serving his term.

Trump's act is certain to renew charges that the president intervenes in the US justice system to help friends and allies and punish critics and perceived enemies.

Stone, one of Trump's oldest confidants, was convicted last November of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to help him win the 2016 election.

The fiery White House statement reiterated Trump's charge that Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigated an alleged crime that was never committed. It argued that Stone should therefore never have been charged in the first place.

""The simple fact is that if the Special Counsel had not been pursuing an absolutely baseless investigation, Mr Stone would not be facing time in prison,"" it said.

The Trump administration had already intervened once to help Stone. After prosecutors recommended a prison term of seven to nine years, Attorney General Bill Barr, who has been accused of acting like Trump's personal lawyer, stepped in and called that excessive.

All four prosecutors handling the case quit it and a newly appointed prosecutor recommended a prison term of three to four years for Stone.

Stone was the sixth aide of Trump -- who was impeached last year for abusing his power -- to be convicted of charges arising from Mueller's probe into Russian election interference.

Critics responded quickly after Trump commuted Stone's sentence.

Senator Kamala Harris of California noted that Stone, who is white, is now walking free while police officers in Kentucky accused of killing a black health worker in her home have not been arrested or charged.

the physicist who has somehow come to dominate Johnson’s Covid policy.

Physicist? Yes, that is his main academic discipline. He doesn’t even have a Biology O-level, as he himself cheerfully admits. But that’s no odder than his repeated record of wild predictions of vast numbers of deaths, for a variety of diseases from foot-and-mouth to mad cow, which can kindly be described as exaggerated.

And then there’s his complicated private life, which resulted in a pretty clear breach of the miserable restrictions he had helped to impose on the rest of us. As with all such cases, I don’t blame him for breaking the stupid rules. I despise him as a hypocrite for supporting them and then thinking they didn’t apply to him.

Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said at the time that it was ‘just not possible’ for Ferguson to continue advising the Government. But this was not true. The professor was said to have resigned from the SAGE advisory committee. But did he? Not really. A current State website lists him as a member of the ‘New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group’ (NERVTAG). Minutes suggest he was only ever away from that for a few weeks. But this is small potatoes, set beside an amazing admission by Ferguson in a recent interview with the semi-official newspaper The Times. Here, Ferguson spoke of SAGE’s growing admiration for China’s tyrannical attempts to contain Covid.

Professor Neil Ferguson (pictured) has made several predictions that have turned out to be wildly inaccurate and doesn't even own a Biology O-level

To begin with they thought – with good reason – that the dishonest and repressive Chinese state was covering up the truth about the Wuhan outbreak. I am sure they still are covering it up.

Last week, after a ‘trial’ of a few hours, Zhang Zhan, 37, a Chinese former lawyer and citizen journalist, was sentenced to four years in prison. She was originally arrested in Wuhan in May for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ – a non-crime often alleged against dissidents in China. Then she was charged with ‘disseminating false information’ about Wuhan.

She went on hunger strike against her treatment. But this was China, not a free country. Her lawyer says (and I don’t doubt it) that she had a feeding tube forcibly inserted and her arms restrained to stop her pulling it out. Those who managed to see her in the courtroom before she was condemned and sent off to Peking’s Gulag say she appeared there in a wheelchair, her hair cropped.

China is a police state that only last week sentenced a citizen journalist to four years in prison

Modern China is a horrible place, cruel, ruthless and unembarrassed. But for some reason SAGE came to like Peking’s Covid strategy. Ferguson told The Times that ‘as the data accrued it became clear it was an effective policy’.

I’d be interested to know how the SAGE geniuses evaluated data from this police state, which lacks a free press or independent universities. But there.

Even so, they hesitated. As Ferguson says: ‘It’s a Communist one-party state, we said. We couldn’t get away with it in Europe, we thought.’

Aren’t those words ‘we couldn’t get away with it’ interesting? Is this the way in which public servants in a free country think of the normal limits on what they can do? I can only hope not.

But Ferguson and his friends then saw what happened in Italy, where a formerly free country reached for the weapons of repression and mass house arrest. And the rule of fear was so great that they got away with it. So we were next. Or, as Ferguson puts it: ‘And then Italy did it. And we realised we could.’

They could. But they did not have to. They chose the Chinese way. And so they ‘got away with’ beginning a disaster which still continues. There is still no evidence that any of this Chinese-inspired repression has worked.

Every country that has locked down has failed to control the disease and keeps doing the same thing over and over again in the hope of getting a different result.

If lockdown is an effective policy, then the guillotine is a good cure for a headache (except that the guillotine probably does cure a headache).

The shame of it is that the lockdown fanatics did ‘get away with it’, and continue to do so. That is, quite simply, because most of the responsible people in our society did not stand up for wisdom and freedom but allowed themselves to ",[],"['dailymail', 'debate', 'Matt Hancock', 'SAGE', 'China']",set(),"['Peter Hitchens', 'Peter Hitchens For The Mail On Sunday']",2021-01-02 22:00:56+00:00,,,True,2.0,,"PETER HITCHENS: One of the strangest things about our recent national madness has been the role of Professor Neil Ferguson, who has come to dominate Johnson's Covid policy.",en,/favicon.ico?v=2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-9106799/PETER-HITCHENS-Guess-Professor-Lockdown-got-ideas-Chinas-police-state.html,<Element div at 0x7f5d8690fb80>,<Element div at 0x7f5d8acfe540>,<Element html at 0x7f5d8932a1d0>,<Element html at 0x7f5d8932a9f0>,{},a27f8f59c8474707a1f06bc2861f64cc.1652103880.2622092,gdelt_events,09-05-2022,39253310-a7d1-0936-9347-01dec6cb5509,2021_01_01-2021_02_28_gdelt_data.csv

On Thursday, February 10, 2022, a journalist named Kwabena Bobie Ansah, host of ''The Citizen Show'' on Accra FM, was arrested by persons purported to be National Security operatives for accusing the First and Second Ladies of stealing some government lands.



He also posted on social media saying ''this current judicial system is corrupt and made up of crooks and criminals, led by a corrupt Chief Justice who's struggling to purge himself from a $5 thievery allegations. Facts are sacred''.



Bobie Ansah was arrested after refusing to honor Police invites for interrogation into his allegations, a Police statement said.



He is being held on a charge of offensive conduct.



Also Onua TV’s Morning Show host, Blessed Godsbrain Smart, popularly called ''Captain Smart'', was detained by National Security Operatives after he had been granted bail by the court following his arrest over extortion.



He was detained along with another staff, Eric Dadzie Copperfield, also called DJ GH Boy who is also facing charges of abetment to extort.



Furthermore, the leader of the pressure group #FixTheCountry, Oliver Barker-Vormawor, who recently led a protest against President Nana Akufo-Addo's government was on Friday arrested after making comments on social media about plotting a coup.



""If this E-Levy passes... I will do the coup myself. Useless Army!"", he said in a series of posts on Facebook.



Following his post, a Police report read; ""The post contained a clear statement of intent with a possible will to execute a coup in his declaration of intent to subvert the constitution of the Republic of Ghana.''



Mr. Barker-Vormawor is charged with treason felony.



Reacting to the issue during a panel discussion programme on Peace FM's ''Kokrokoo'', Nana Akomea noted that the arrests are a measure to sanitize the airwaves.



He supported the action by the security agencies saying ''I find it to be restoring sanity. We have free speech as we all know. We have media freedom but we also have laws. So, the fact that we have free speech doesn't mean I can say anything against my brother Kwesi Pratt and claim it's free speech. If I say something against Kwesi Pratt and it sullies his integrity while I have no evidence, I can't say it's free speech. If we do that, the whole society will collapse''.



To him, a lot of people have made similar statements and have been ignored for far too long, hence, it's about time the laws were exercised.



''Most times, we ignore but should we continue to ignore it, it will become worse'', he stressed.

Prosecutors have charged a 25-year-old man with two felonies for assaulting a coffee stand worker early Monday morning.

Jesus Martinez-Escudero faces charges of first-degree burglary and second-degree assault after Eugene police say he assaulted a barista at a Dutch Bros. drive-thru near the University of Oregon campus.

According to a news release, the Eugene Police Department received a report around 5:30 a.m. Monday that a man had attacked a worker at the Dutch Bros. drive-thru at 2115 Franklin Blvd.

The man, now identified as Martinez-Escudero, was wearing a mask that concealed his nose and mouth. He tried to grab the worker and then hit her with a blunt object, EPD spokesperson Melinda McLaughlin said in the release.

The employee ""did all the right things,"" McLaughlin said, including fighting him off and fleeing as he reached toward his pocket. She had non-life-threatening injuries.

Within 16 hours, police identified Martinez-Escudero as a suspect and arrested him at his home. He was booked into Lane County jail around 1 a.m. Tuesday and arraigned Tuesday afternoon, according to public records.

Court records show he's next due in court at 2:30 p.m. March 17 for a pre-trial conference.

The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Thursday redeemed the N30m bounty to the police following the arrest of notorious armed robber and kidnapper, Honest Diigbara, popularly known as Boboski last Saturday.

Wike had last year placed the bounty on Boboski for information that would lead to his arrest.

Bobisky died hours after his arrest while being paraded to journalists at the police headquarter in Port Harcourt.

Wike presented the cheque to the Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, on Thursday through the Seceratry to the State Government, Dr Tammy Danagogo, at the Government House, Port Harcourt.

Mukan confirmed the receipt of the cheque, describing the governor as a promise keeper.

He added that the late kidnapper killed a major police informant before he was arrested.

“I am glad to inform you that today (Thursday) His Excellency redeemed that pledge he placed as bounty on Boboski.

“He released the sum of N30m as he promised to the command to get it across to the informants who assisted the police in the arrest of Boboski,” he stated.

Mukan said a herbalist who had been providing the command with vital information was killed by Boboski.

“Only God knows how Boboski located the man. This bounty will go a long way to support the family of that man,” Mukan said.

He also said another informant had been successfully relocated to Port Harcourt so that he would not be killed.

Police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said Erlynda Lucero was found just after 1 p.m. Friday and taken into custody without incident in the 700 block of 94th SW. An arrest warrant had been issued for her on Wednesday.

Lucero is suspected of fatally shooting Daniel Guardado in the early morning on June 24 near Carlisle and Menaul NE. Police previously said officers were called to the scene around 5:30 a.m. and found Guardado, 23, behind the wheel of an SUV.

“Lucero allegedly fired shots from the passenger seat of a vehicle, striking Guardado as he drove his vehicle on eastbound Menaul,” Gallegos said in a news release issued Friday. “Guardado had been following Lucero’s vehicle after she pulled a gun on him during a failed attempt to exchange drugs in a hotel parking lot.”

The group claim it is illegal.

The Ministry of Communication is spearheading the re-registration of all SIM cards in the country as part of efforts to clamp down on fraud.

Four months into the exercise which is expected to last for six months, SDDDF-Africa has released a statement asking the National Communication Authority (NCA) and Ministry of Communications to halt it.

“SDDDF-Africa wishes to urge the National Communication Authority (NCA) and Ministry of Communications to immediately halt the illegal exercise of Mobile Telecom Companies creating another biometric database or national identity register,” part of a release from the group has said.

SDDDF-Africa argues that the current biometric registration exercise being undertaken by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, does not only poses a major health risk but runs contrary to the law that establishes the National Identity Register (ACT 750) and a complete waste of public and individuals' scarce resources - time; money; energy etc as well as endangering the safety of the biometric data of Ghanaians.

SDDDF-Africa stresses that after this release, the leadership of NCA and the Ministry in charge of Communication will suffice to immediately “halt the sheer wastage of scarce resources and to end the needless misery that Ghanaians are being subjected to at the premises of the Telecom companies.”

For Immediate Release

January 12, 2022

HALT THE NEW BIOMETRIC SIM REGISTRATION BY MOBILE TELECOM COMPANIES

SDDDF-Africa wishes to urge the National Communication Authority (NCA) and Ministry of Communications to immediately halt the illegal exercise of Mobile Telecom Companies creating another biometric database or national identity register.

The mandate to establish a national biometric register or database is the sole preserve of the National Identification Authority (Authority).

Section 2 subsection (1), (2) and (3) of the National Identity Register Act 2008 (ACT 750) which specifically mandates NIA to create the register reads:

2. Establishment of National Identity Register

2 (1) There is established by this Act a register of individuals known as the National Identity Register.

2 (2) The Register shall be maintained as an electronic database.

2 (3) The purpose for which the Register is to be maintained is confined to matters of public interest.

Again, for emphasis, this current biometric registration exercise being undertaken by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only poses a major health risk but runs contrary to the law that establishes the National Identity Register (ACT 750) and a complete waste of public and individuals' scarce resources - time; money; energy etc as well as endangering the safety of the biometric data of Ghanaians.

Fact is, any one with a mobile phone and a bearer of the Ghana Card already has his biometrics captured by NIA and stored in the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS).

It is also important to note that NIA has the capacity to generate data of all customers of the various Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) for identity verification and authentication purposes because the mobile phone numbers are linked to Ghana Card PIN, linked to Biometric Data, linked to Ghana Post GPS etc and so far NIA has collected over 16million phone numbers which any USER Agency in need of can easily rely upon.

It is the expectation of SDDDF-Africa that leadership will suffice to immediately halt the sheer wastage of scarce resources and to end the needless misery that Ghanaians are being subjected to at the premises of the Telecom companies.

""The purpose for which the Register is to be maintained is confined to matters of public interest"", section 2 (3) of ACT 750 states (emphasis).

God bless our homeland Ghana.

And make our Nation great and strong.

Turkish drone strikes in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province killed 19 government soldiers on Sunday, a war monitor reported, as tensions soared between Damascus and Ankara.

The 19 died in strikes on a military convoy in the Jabal al-Zawiya area and a base near Maaret al-Numan city, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The report came hours after Turkey shot down two Syrian warplanes, in an escalating offensive against the Damascus government in Idlib, where Islamist fighters backed by Ankara pose the biggest obstacle to Damascus seizing back control over all of Syria.

Following weeks of violence in the province, Turkey confirmed a full military operation against Russian-backed Syrian forces after 34 Turkish soldiers were killed last week in an air strike blamed on Damascus.

However Ankara has insisted it does not want to clash directly with Moscow.

“One anti-aircraft system that shot down one of our armed drones and two other anti-aircraft systems have been destroyed, and two SU-24 regime planes that were attacking our aircraft have been downed,” Turkey’s defence ministry said.

Syrian state media said Turkish forces “targeted” two of its planes over Idlib. A rebel group and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, both said the planes had been downed.

The situation in Idlib was already volatile as the government supported by Russian air power pressed an assault on the region in a bid to retake the last opposition enclave in a nine-year civil war.

The confrontation between the Russia-backed Syrian forces and NATO-member Turkey, which supports Syrian rebels, has prompted worries over a wider conflict and a migrant crisis in Europe similar to 2015.

Migrant numbers have already surged along the rugged frontier after Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, seeking to pressure the EU over Syria, said the country had “opened the doors” to Europe.

Greece said Sunday it has blocked nearly 10,000 migrants at its border with Turkey.

Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar announced “operation ‘Spring Shield'” for the first time, adding that it “successfully continues”.

Turkish forces hit Syrian government positions after Erdogan warned Damascus would “pay a price” for the air strike.

Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in Syria — but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.

Turkey wants the international community to establish a no-fly zone over Idlib.

SANA Syrian state media reported that the government shot down a Turkish drone near the town of Saraqeb, publishing footage of an aircraft tumbling from the sky in flames. Those images could not be immediately confirmed.

But Turkish defence ministry confirmed one of its drones was shot down.

Moscow meeting?

Earlier on Sunday, Istanbul police detained the editor-in-chief of the Turkish version of Russia’s Sputnik website as its offices were being searched in Istanbul.

Three of its journalists were also taken to a courthouse in Ankara for questioning, likely related to a Sputnik article in English claiming that Turkey’s Hatay province was “stolen” from Syria. Colonial power France ceded the southern region to Turkey in 1938.

The news website later said they had been released.

Turkish media said Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet in Moscow on March 5. They already spoke by telephone last week when both expressed “concern” over the escalation.

The Russian and Turkish foreign ministers also spoke by telephone on Sunday, Moscow’s ministry said, to discuss preparations for the meeting between the two leaders, and the safety of the Sputnik journalists.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said he “hoped” the meeting would be on Thursday or Friday, which he admitted would be “difficult” but was “important” nonetheless.

Protecting borders

Some 13,000 migrants have amassed at the Turkey-Greece border, including families with young children who spent the night in the cold, the International Organisation for Migration said.

An estimated additional 2,000 migrants arrived at the Pazarkule border gate Sunday, including Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis, according to an AFP reporter.

But as the crowds rushed to enter Europe, Greek police and soldiers blocked 9,972 “illegal entrances” from entering the northeastern Evros region in the past 24 hours, a Greek government source said.

The implicated officials are chief human capital officer Monika Pendukeni and chief technology officer Valerie Garises.

Lawyer Kobus Miller, who led the disciplinary enquiry into the conduct of senior managers, recommended the dismissals in a ruling delivered last week.

The disciplinary process started a year ago, three months after the managers were suspended.

Some of the charges are linked to decisions by former NIP chief executive officer Augustinus Katiti, who was suspended in 2018.

Pendukeni and Garises faced charges of unprocedural appointment of staff members, awarding uncapped bursaries, payment transactions between themselves and NIP consultants, and dishing out contracts to people they have relationships with.

""I bear in mind the charges on which the respective employees were convicted. They are all serious in their nature and run course to any notion of sound corporate governance.

""I accordingly recommend that Pendukeni and Garises be dismissed,"" Miller said.

Pendukeni faced six charges while Garises faced seven, including the failure to declare a conflict of interest and following unlawful instructions from Katiti.

Together, they were found guilty of ignoring the company's procurement policies when they contracted Roma Kitchens to supply office furniture valued at more than N$7 million in 2016.

Pendukeni was found guilty on all charges, while Garises was found guilty on six.

Pendukeni alledgedly hired two employees, Jefta Gaob and John Kaimu, unprocedurally for the position of manager of corporate affairs, instead of one.

This was after Johannes Klemens, who occupied the position temporarily, left to pursue studies.

The appointment was made in November 2017, documents show.

""What cannot be denied is the fact that Ms Pendukeni aided and abetted Mr Katiti to engage in what was clearly a breach of the relevant NIP policy,"" Miller's ruling said.

He said the entire process was irregular and irrational from its inception to its conclusion as policies were deliberately ignored.

He added that in the event where deviations of policies were to be considered, Pendukeni would have taken it up with the board, of which the primary responsibility is to approve policies.

Pendukeni has been employed by the NIP since December 2006.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Garises started working at the NIP in January 2012.

As a member of the procurement committee, Garises did not declare her relationship with Green Enterprises (Pty) Ltd managing director Llewellyn le Hane.

The NIP later awarded Green Enterprises a tender, Miller said.

He also found that Le Hane's name appeared on Garises' curriculum vitae as a reference.

""This indicates a relationship, which is neither casual nor one in passing.

""As a member of the procurement committee, there was a duty to disclose possible conflicts of interest, be it real or perceived, which was not done. I believe it should have been done,"" the ruling reads.

Garises was also found guilty regarding a cyber security service tender allocated to the company Netsecurity (Pty) Ltd.

The rationale behind hiring Netsecurity (Pty) Ltd is that Katiti was allegedly blackmailed to pay U$3 200 (around N$51 000), or compromising material depicting him would be circulated to all his contacts.

This is according to leaked email exchanges between the company and Garises, seen by The Namibian.

Miller said the NIP's procurement committee refused to authorise direct tenders, but Garises and Katiti decided to procure the services directly from the company.

""Katiti was the one who made the final decision, but there can be no doubt that he acted with the support and acquiescence of Garises,"" he said.

Miller added: ""Garises stated in her defence that she was simply following an instruction from the CEO. The fact remains that the instruction was not lawful.""

Katiti has over the years denied any wrongdoing and insisted on a witch-hunt against him.

He castigated the board for focusing on issues like buying furniture from Italy and writing to politicians, while the organisation was struggling to handle basic blood tests.

The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in India crossed the 20,000-mark on Wednesday while the death toll crossing 650 till Thursday morning.

As of 7:00 AM on Thursday, COVID-19 has globally infected over 26.26 lakh people and killed over 1.83 lakh people, as per the data provided by Johns Hopkins University.

On Wednesday, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that coronavirus will remain with us for a long time and warned that several countries are still in the early stages of tackling the pandemic.

The central government has also exempted additional agricultural and forestry items, shops of educational books for students and shops of electric fans from the lockdown restrictions. It is to be noted that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued revised guidelines to exempt certain activities during the nationwide lockdown to fight the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak, which is spreading like wildfire across India.

The government has also approved an ordinance through which an accused involved in the attack on healthcare workers could be sentenced from 6 months to 7 years in imprisonment depending on the grievousness of the injuries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed the ordinance.

detained at least 11 journalists near the KGB security service building in the capital, Minsk, in the latest crackdown on the press ahead of the country’s upcoming presidential election.



The detentions on July 28 occurred as a representative of jailed presidential candidate Viktar Babaryka filed a petition with the KGB to change the terms of his arrest.



The representative, Maria Kolesnikova, was untouched by security forces, but several people were arrested outside the KGB building as they sought to file similar petitions to release Babaryka on his own recognizance.



According to Barys Haretski, deputy chairman of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, 11 journalists were also detained while covering the event.



All but three were later released, he said on Facebook.



Among those detained were a journalist from Tut.by, four journalists from Belsat TV, two reporters from BelaPAN, a photojournalist from Russia’s TASS news agency, and Reuters journalists.



The Tut.by news website reported that security forces took the journalists to the Zavodskoye district Department of Internal Affairs to check their media accreditation.



The latest detentions have come just days after President Alyaksandr Lukashenka attacked both Russian and Western media outlets for their coverage of developments in Belarus.

He also called for those promoting “mass disturbances” to be expelled from the country because they ""don't observe our country's laws.""



Lukashenka faces mounting public pressure after 26 years in power and an energized opposition ahead of the August 9 presidential election in which he is seeking a sixth presidential term.



Hundreds of people, including activists and bloggers, have been detained or arrested as the government cracks down hard on rallies and demonstrations supporting opposition candidates, who were not registered by election officials.



On July 14 and 15, at least 17 journalists were detained while covering protests against the electoral body's decision to deny opposition presidential candidates Valery Tsapkala and Babaryka the ability to register in the upcoming election, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.



In June, Belarusian authorities detained at least 14 journalists for allegedly participating in unsanctioned protests, and in May, five journalists covering opposition candidates were detained.

Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya has emerged as the opposition's main candidate against strongman Lukashenka.



She became a presidential candidate because her jailed husband, well-known vlogger Syarhey Tsikhanouski, was incarcerated after he openly expressed his intention to run for president.



Tsikhanouskaya is campaigning with the representatives of two opposition candidates who were denied registration as presidential candidates -- former Belgazprombank head Babaryka and prominent businessman Tsapkala.



Babaryka, who was viewed as a potentially potent rival to Lukashenka, was jailed in June on suspicion of money laundering, bribery, and tax evasion. He rejected the charges as politically motivated.

'This clan is full of fools': Rantings of Amol Rajan On William and Kate Urged them to 'renounce the luxuries of royal patronage and aristocracy' Described their public role as a 'total fraud', adding: 'Neither of you have a special claim on the glorious city of Cambridge so quit pretending you do' Said that rather than a 'vast palace' they should raise their family in a 'decent suburban townhouse' and send their child to a 'normal school' On Prince Philip A 'racist buffoon' On Prince Charles 'Scientifically illiterate' On the Diamond Jubilee A 'celebration of mediocrity' On the Royal Family 'Aside from the Queen – whose public image is crafted by an ever-expanding team of propagandists – this clan is unusually full of fools' Advertisement

The journalist who fronted the BBC 's controversial royal documentary today apologised for describing the public role of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as a 'total fraud' and called Prince Philip a 'racist buffoon'.

Amol Rajan – the BBC journalist who presented The Princes And The Press – made the incendiary remarks in articles written in 2012 for The Independent, the newspaper which he used to edit.

But today, Rajan tweeted: 'In reference to very reasonable questions about some foolish commentary from a former life, I want to say I deeply regret it. I wrote things that were rude and immature and I look back on them now with real embarrassment, and ask myself what I was thinking, frankly…'

In a second tweet, he added: 'I would like to say sorry for any offence they caused then or now. I'm completely committed to impartiality and hope our recent programmes can be judged on their merits.'

In one open letter to William and Kate, written in December 2012 after the couple announced they were expecting their first child, the self-declared republican urged them to 'renounce the luxuries of royal patronage and aristocracy', claiming that 'everyone will be a winner' if they do.

Although Rajan congratulated the couple on the news of the pregnancy, he described their public role as a 'total fraud', adding: 'Neither of you have a special claim on the glorious city of Cambridge so quit pretending you do'.

He also suggested that rather than a 'vast palace', the duke and duchess should raise their family in a 'decent suburban townhouse' and should send their child to a 'normal school'.

In other columns written for the newspaper at the time, the 38-year-old journalist said that Prince Philip was a 'racist buffoon' and described Prince Charles as 'scientifically illiterate'.

He also blasted the Diamond Jubilee as a 'celebration of mediocrity' and said of the royals: 'Aside from the Queen – whose public image is crafted by an ever-expanding team of propagandists – this clan is unusually full of fools.'

His apology comes after BBC director-general Tim Davie said last year that he would crack down on staff posting their views online to ensure impartiality, and staff could even be forced off Twitter if they fail to meet the 'high bar'.

The revelations will pile fresh pressure on the BBC over its handling of Rajan's two-part documentary, which drew unprecedented censure from Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace and accusations of bias.

The royal households believe it contained a slew of unsubstantiated and categorically inaccurate accusations about collusion with the media, particularly in connection with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex during the tumultuous period of their decision to quit royal duties, dubbed 'Megxit'.

The palaces were also said to be angered at the way many of the assertions made in the documentary aired on prime-time TV were permitted to go unquestioned by Rajan, the BBC's media editor.

Russia’s Investigative Committee on Wednesday detained five former police officers involved in a controversial drug arrest of a prominent investigative journalist last year and said they will be charged with fabricating evidence.

Ivan Golunov, 37, was arrested in June 2019 in Moscow on drug-dealing charges that he rejected as a sham. The journalist argued the drugs found in his backpack and his apartment were planted by the police in revenge for his investigations of corruption in Moscow’s law enforcement community.

Several days of mass protests in Russia’s capital erupted following his arrest before the charges against Mr. Golunov were dropped as the Russian government admitted there was no evidence to support them. Mr. Golunov and his colleagues from the independent Meduza online outlet vowed to bring those who orchestrated the arrest to justice.

Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko told reporters on Wednesday the officers “illegally acquired, stored and transported” the drugs in order to plant them on Mr. Golunov, “with the goal of unlawfully prosecuting” the journalist.

Wednesday’s detentions came almost seven months after Mr. Golunov was released and a probe was launched into his arrest.

Mr. Golunov has repeatedly complained about the police stalling the investigation. In November, the journalist sued the police for “lack of action” in the case, but to no avail. At the same time, his lawyers discovered the investigation was classified as secret, something police in Russia rarely do when it comes to criminal cases that don’t involve state secrets.

been released and repatriated to Pakistan under the royal pardon: FO

ISLAMABAD (APP / Web Desk) - Sub-committee of National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistani and Human Resource Development on Wednesday was informed that so far 579 Pakistani prisoners had been repatriated from Saudi Arabia to the country.

“These prisoners were released from Saudi jails on the order of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his recent visit to Pakistan”, the committee was briefed.

Some 579 Pakistani prisoners have been released and repatriated to Pakistan under the royal pardon, Foreign Ministry’s Director General (Middle East) Syed Zahid Raza told the sub-committee that was recently formed with the mandate to ensure provision of legal assistance to under-trial Pakistani prisoners, in different foreign jails.

Earlier, Saudi Crown Prince Muhammed Bin Salman had ordered the release of 2,107 Pakistani prisoners in Saudi Arabia with immediate effect.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry shared that the Saudi crown prince, who was on a two-day visit to Pakistan, ordered the release of Pakistani prisoners on Prime Minister Imran Khan s request.

""HRH Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman has graciously agreed to free 2,107 Pakistani prisoners in Saudi Arabia with immediate effect,"" Qureshi tweeted. ""Cases of the remaining will be reviewed. People of Pakistan thank HRH for responding immediately to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s request,"" the foreign minister added.

The information minister tweeted, ""As a sequel to prime minister of Pakistan’s request, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of KSA Mohammed Bin Salman has ordered the immediate release of 2,107 Pakistani prisoners Saudi Jails.”

The fate of thousands of Pakistani workers locked up in jails across the Middle East is a sensitive issue in Pakistan, where there is a perception the prisoners are mostly poor labourers who have no real legal recourse.

Huge numbers of Pakistanis travel to the Middle East every year, with many working on construction sites or as domestic helpers. The remittances they send back are vital for the Pakistani economy.",[],"['Pakistan', 'Prisoners', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Pm Imran Khan']","{'Coronavirus', 'Governor Punjab Appointment', 'Russia-Ukraine Conflict'}",[],,,,True,2.0,,579 Pakistani prisoners have been released and repatriated to Pakistan under the royal pardon: FO,en,https://img.dunyanews.tv/images//apple-touch-icon-120x120-precomposed.png,https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/511103-579-Pakistani-prisoners-released-from-Saudi-Arabia-under-royal-pardon,<Element div at 0x7ef754cca090>,<Element div at 0x7ef754d4ecc0>,<Element html at 0x7ef754cb4d10>,<Element html at 0x7ef754cbd540>,{},fce2e6e4a567a7fc95af22610dad5cf1.1652453330.0560842,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,2970a689-b6a9-9383-bba8-8b4eee8ea339,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Ludhiana, October 18

Accusing the police of registering false cases against Akali workers allegedly on the instructions of the Congress government, senior SAD leaders, including Daljeet Singh Cheema, Bikram Singh Majithia and SAD candidate Manpreet Singh Ayali, gheraoed the Mullanpur Dakha police station. The SAD leaders and workers also raised slogans against the police for allegedly harassing party workers.

They complained to SSP (Rural) Sandeep Goel about registration of ""false"" cases against party workers. Police teams from seven districts are conducting raids at the houses of Akali workers after registering ""false"" cases related to mobile theft, stubble-burning, etc., they alleged.

Bikram Singh Majithia said he cited 18 specific cases of vendetta politics before the SSP and asked him to tell why raids were being conducted against SAD workers for the past one week. ""All this is happening under the SSP’s watch. We will not allow this,"" he said.

Majithia told the SSP that a ""listed gangster accompanied two Congress ministers to welcome the Chief Minister during his second roadshow in Dakha."" ""The police were also a mute spectator when Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu attacked a Sikh man and disrespected his articles of faith. But no action was taken against him,"" Majithia claimed.

Daljeet Singh Cheema said, ""One such false case has also been registered against 60-year-old Kamaljit Singh Guddu of Sahouli village for snatching mobile phone from a labourer. The case was registered against him because he has been campaigning for the SAD.""

Ayali said, “If such raids are not stopped, I and my family will offer arrest on Saturday morning.""

Meanwhile, Ludhiana (Rural) Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Sandeep Goel claimed, “We have not detained any Akali Dal worker illegally. We are committed to ensure free and fair elections in Dakha Assembly segment.”

arrested nearly three years ago for “insulting religious beliefs.”

The three women were arrested by local authorities in May 2019, accused of “carrying out a profanation of the Virgin Mary of Częstochowa.”

They were charged for possessing and distributing posters featuring the “Black Madonna of Częstochowa” — a revered icon of the Virgin Mary in Poland — wearing a rainbow-colored halo.

They were initially acquitted in March 2021, but prosecutors appealed the decision. On Wednesday, a court threw out that appeal, according to Amnesty International.

“Today’s decision comes as a huge relief but cannot disguise the fact that these three women should never have been put on trial in the first place,” Catrinel Motoc, senior campaigner in Amnesty International’s Europe Regional Office, said in a statement.

“Distributing posters of the Virgin Mary wearing a rainbow halo should never be criminalized, so it is right that the appeal against their acquittal was rejected,” she added.

GOOD NEWS 🎉 The appeal against the acquittal of 3 women human rights activists in Poland on absurd charges of “offending religious beliefs” was dismissed. The decision comes as a huge relief but they should never have been put on trial in the first place.https://t.co/IxBGWMxpAo — Amnesty International (@amnesty) January 12, 2022

In Poland a person who “offends the religious feelings of others by publicly insulting a religious object or place of worship” may face up to two years behind bars.

Activists with the international human rights group said that the women were arrested for their activist work.

According to the organization, one of the women, Elżbieta Podlesna, was returning home to Poland after traveling to Belgium and the Netherlands in an advocacy tour to protest against the increasing pressure on rule of law in her country.

She said that in the early hours of May 6, 2019, police went into her home and confiscated her laptop, cell phone and memory cards. Podlesna claimed she knew she was being watched by the police, and that she was aware that authorities had requested surveillance camera footage from her building.

According to Motoc, since the start of the case against the three women, “more than a quarter of a million people have spoken out to demand that the authorities drop the charges in a case that has come to symbolize some of Poland’s most disturbing anti-human rights trends. Not only is space for free expression, activism and peaceful protest shrinking, but the climate of homophobia in the country is worsening amid an increase in hate crimes, the introduction of LGBTI free zones by local councils and attempts to ban Pride Marches,” she said.

ILGA Europe, a coalition of more than 600 LGBTQ rights organizations in Europe and Central Asia, ranks Poland as the worst-performing country in the EU in terms of LGBTQ rights.

“This case has also revealed an ugly seam of state-sponsored homophobia and exposed the way in which Poland’s criminal justice system is being used to target, intimidate and harass human rights defenders simply because of their activism. The Polish authorities must finally end their witch-hunt against these and other activists,” she added.

In June 2020 the Polish president, and then-candidate for reelection Andrzej Duda, told supporters during a rally that LGBTQ “ideology” was worse than communism.

2016; Credit: Reuters / Mathias Loevgreen Bojesen / Scanpix

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Former immigration minister Inger Stojberg, a main architect behind some of Denmark's tough immigration policies, was voted out of parliament on Tuesday by her fellow lawmakers following her conviction in a rare impeachment case earlier this month.

Ms Stojberg was handed a 60-day prison sentence last week by an almost unanimous impeachment court for intentionally ordering the separation of under-age couples seeking asylum during her tenure as immigration minister in 2016.

""The conclusion in the case must be that Mrs Inger Stojberg's conviction at the impeachment court is incompatible with being a member of parliament"", Jeppe Bruus, a spokesman for the ruling Social Democratic party, told parliament.

Under Danish and human rights law, each refugee couple, either married or in a relationship, must be assessed on its own merits, implying that the minister's order to separate all under-age couples was illegal. A total of 23 couples were separated.

The rules were changed to comply with law in the same year.

98 lawmakers, including from the Liberal Party, her former party, on Tuesday voted in favour of ousting Ms Stojberg from parliament, with eighteen from immigration hard-liner Danish People's Party and New Right voting against the motion.

25 out of 26 judges agreed to convict Stojberg in the impeachment court, only the sixth of its kind in the Nordic country in more than 170 years and the first since 1995.

After the vote, Inger Stojberg told reporters: ""I would rather be voted out by my colleagues here in parliament because I have tried to protect some girls than getting voted out by the Danish people because I have turned a blind eye"".

After her incarceration, she is free to run in the next general election.

""Do not expect this to be the last your hear from me"", she said.",[],[''],set(),"['Sinn Fein Eyes Historic Northern Ireland Election Win...', 'Emperor Penguin At Serious Risk Of Extinction Due To Climate Chan...', 'Inflation Forecasts Revised Upwards...', 'New British Chamber Working Group Addresses Sustainability Today ...', 'Luxembourg Drops Places In Global Green Finance Index...', 'National Digital Inclusion Day Workshops Announced...']",,,,True,2.0,,,en,,http://www.chronicle.lu/category/international/38837-danish-ex-minister-ousted-from-parliament-after-impeachment,<Element div at 0x7f4b53c9d9a0>,<Element div at 0x7f4b53c9ddb0>,<Element html at 0x7f4b53c86ef0>,<Element html at 0x7f4b53c86770>,{},ac2f9df9e1028ceb1c2940e5477a02bd.1651852861.2594938,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,6e28e64d-30fb-7368-aded-13ddd42ada41,2021_11_01-2021_12_31_gdelt_data.csv

Tsewang Rigzin, a journalist with the Jammu-based State Times who also runs a prominent Facebook page, Ladakh in the Media, was arrested following a complaint from Namgyal. The abusive comment against the MP had appeared on Rigzin’s Facebook page.

A Leh journalist who had last year alleged a BJP attempt to bribe reporters was briefly arrested on Saturday over another person’s abusive remarks against Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal.

Rigzin, who was granted bail on Saturday evening, has received widespread support.

The journalist released a video and a statement on Monday night detailing the “real” reasons for his arrest.

He told The Telegraph he had been arrested because of his role in “exposing” how BJP politicians allegedly tried to bribe journalists in Leh for favourable coverage ahead of last year’s parliamentary polls.

He said he had been targeted also for taking a stand against last week’s resolution by the BJP-led Leh autonomous council seeking constitutional safeguards for Ladakh.

“My Facebook page has 34,000 members, which is quite a big number in a place like Ladakh (with a population of 2.5 lakh). I was summoned twice by the police, first on September 1 and then on September 5, in relation to a comment made by somebody,” he said.

“I told them it’s not possible to monitor all the comments and offered to delete it but they told me not to, saying it would destroy evidence. On September 5, they told me they could not trace the person who had made the remarks. I don’t know whether he is a real person or a fake. But they told me they have to arrest me. I fully cooperated.… It was all planned.”

Rigzin said he was not detained in the lockup and had called an acquaintance to deposit bail for his release. He said the arrest was made under IPC Section 188 (disobeying a public servant). He also faces charges under Sections 294 (public obscenity) and 500 (defamation).

Namgyal did not respond to calls from this newspaper. The MP, however, defended his decision to lodge a complaint in a Facebook post on Tuesday, asking how he could be expected to “tolerate such unacceptable acts towards my family”.

He did not mention Rigzin by name but named the person who had abused him. The comment, he wrote, was related neither “to my political profession, nor to my party affiliation (or) to my stand on current issues”.

“It was (a) purely personal attack on my family members which is (a) very emotional issue for me. So I request all to please let police work independently rather (than) standing (with) anyone without knowing facts and supporting one who is trying to gain public sympathy by mixing the matter with other issues.”

Namgyal said he had lodged the FIR as a “husband of my beloved wife and as a father (of) our son”.

Rigzin said that had the MP called him, he would have clarified the matter.

The arrest came two days after the BJP-run Leh council sought job and land safeguards for Ladakhis under Article 371, the Sixth Schedule or a domicile law.

Rigzin said nobody supported a domicile law in Ladakh as it would encroach on the rights of Ladakhis. The Centre’s new domicile law for Jammu and Kashmir has partially thrown open jobs for “outsiders”.

“I feel that the action against me was just an excuse to harass me, and to silence the voices of thousands of people who are coming out so strongly in support of Sixth Schedule. For several months LiTM (Rigzin’s Facebook page) has been a platform where thousands can listen and express their views,” he said in a statement.

“Secondly, the BJP has been somehow trying to intimidate me for more than a year now, ever since we exposed the bribery case during (the) Lok Sabha election. I was one of the journalists instrumental in making the case public. Whenever I felt I should speak up on an issue as an activist or as a citizen, I never hesitated.”",[],[''],"{'Arrest', 'Bribery', 'Leh', 'Bharatiya Janata Party Bjp', 'Journalists'}",[],,,,True,2.0,,"Rigzin, who was granted bail on Saturday evening, has received widespread support",en,/images/favicon.png,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/bjp-bribe-scribe-held-for-anothers-post/cid/1791391,<Element div at 0x7f3fc193f680>,<Element div at 0x7f3fd5a28950>,<Element html at 0x7f3fc150e400>,<Element html at 0x7f3fc150e130>,{},7868ef2dd787c770f7e7c0fd1432298e.1652180519.6670613,gdelt_events,10-05-2022,0d36e21e-8ecb-5d73-3325-eb7246fe0911,2020_09_01-2020_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Two residents of the Florida Keys have been jailed for failing to quarantine after testing positive for the new coronavirus

MIAMI (AP) – Two residents of the Florida Keys have been jailed for failing to quarantine after testing positive for the new coronavirus.

Jose Interian, 24, and Yohana Gonzalez, 26, are facing charges of violating isolation rules for a quarantine and violating emergency management disaster preparedness rules, according to jail records. They were arrested Wednesday in Key West, officials said.

The Miami Herald reports Interian and Gonzalez had been ordered by the health department to quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19, but neighbors said they were ignoring the order.

Someone videotaped the couple and gave it to Key West police, according to Greg Veliz, Key West’s city manager.

“There were complaints from the neighborhood of them continuing to be outside, going about normal life functions,” Veliz said.

There were no court records in an online docket for the Monroe County court system, so it was not immediately clear whether Interian or Gonzalez had an attorney who could comment.

13/04/2021 - The Italian director is in Apulia shooting his third fiction film, following the abduction of a journalist in the Middle East played by Jasmine Trinca

On My Skin by Alessio Cremonini, which thrilled audiences when it opened the Orizzonti section of the 2018 Venice Film Festival, was the first Italian film to have been released simultaneously in cinemas and on Netflix. It was a decision made by the movie’s producer and distributor Lucky Red which caused a fair deal of controversy and protests among cinema operators, who found themselves deprived of viewers at an already critical time for the market. Exploring the final days of young Stefano Cucchi who died after being assaulted in a Roman prison, Cremonini’s film went on to receive numerous awards on account of its director and screenwriter but also owing to the extraordinary performance delivered by its lead actor Alessandro Borghi (Romulus & Remus – The First King ).

(The article continues below - Commercial information)

The Roman director is now back behind the camera, and has been for a week now, in the name of his third fiction feature film after Border and On My Skin, entitled Profeti, whose screenplay he is also responsible for in league with Monica Zapelli (One Hundred Steps, Red Like the Sky , Nour ). Profeti tells of the abduction of a journalist in the Middle East and her time in captivity. The film is scheduled to be shot in Apulia over a six-week period.

Cremonini has opted for Jasmine Trinca as his protagonist, an actress who previously played Stefano Cucchi’s sister Ilaria in On My Skin, who recently appeared in The Goddess of Fortune , Romantic Guide to Lost Places and her first short film as a director Being My Mom (read interview), and who will be hitting the big screen again this year in Ildiko Enyedi’s The Story of My Wife . In Profeti, Trinca steps into the shoes of a journalist abducted in the Middle East and is shored up by Isabella Nefar (Waiting for the Barbarians ) and Ziad Bakri (Blind Sun ).

Lucknow, Dec 30 (IANS) Swelling crowds, enthused cadres, increasing ground support and a cleverly stitched up alliance may seem a perfect recipe for elections for the Samajwadi Party, but this picture perfect cannot hide the challenges that Akhilesh Yadav faces in the 2022 polls.

For the first time in his two-decade long political career, Akhilesh is leading a campaign single-handedly with almost no back-up mechanism in the party.

Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav is conspicuous by his absence from the campaign and his health issues may not permit him to address more than one or two meetings.

In 2012, when Akhilesh led his party to a comfortable majority, he was firmly backed by his father, while he travelled across the state.

Mulayam would carefully chart his programme, identify leaders who would accompany him and also decide on issues that had to be addressed in different regions.

This time, Akhilesh is the sole campaigner and star attraction of his party and this naturally adds to the challenge and the burden.

Since he took over as the party president in 2017, Akhilesh has not allowed second rung leadership in the party to develop and, today, he runs a one-man army with not even his cousins taking part in the political exercise.

The Samajwadi Party also lacks mature leaders who can deal with situations in the absence of Akhilesh.

Party veterans have either passed away -- like Beni Prasad Varma, Bhagwati Singh -- or are completely side-lined.

The BJP, on the other hand, has a galaxy of campaigners that simultaneously hold fort. On any given day -- as elections draw close -- there are, at least, six BJP leaders addressing meetings in the state.

Another challenge that Akhilesh faces is to rein in overzealous party workers. Buoyed up by the people's response in Akhilesh's rallies, the untamed cadres often go overboard leading to major embarrassments for the party.

For instance, a group of party workers in Kanpur were arrested on Wednesday for attempting to create ruckus during the Prime Minister's visit on Tuesday. As the BJP underlined the incident as an example of 'SP's goondaism', Akhilesh was compelled to expel the five party workers.

Akhilesh also faces the challenge of striking a perfect balance between his Muslim and Hindu supporters.

The BJP has forced him to abandon the policy of Muslim appeasement -- or at least, not be vocal about it -- and peddle soft Hindutva.

As Akhilesh cautiously moves ahead, trying to balance the two ideologies, his Muslim leaders tend to act as irritants.

For instance, the recent statements made by SP MPs Shafiqur -- Rehman Barq and S.T. Hasan, embarrassed the SP to such an extent that Akhilesh was forced to disassociate himself from his own MPs.

Meanwhile, as the time for ticket distribution draws near, Akhilesh will also face a situation when he will have to handle discontent within his own party.

Seats that are given away to multiple allies, will leave the SP workers on these seats simmering with anger. The party could face internal sabotage and it will be testing time for Akhilesh to deal with the situation because the SP leaders have been working for five years in their respective constituencies to contest elections.

Akhilesh has never dabbled in coalition politics and his new allies like Om Prakash Rajbhar, are known to drive a hard bargain in politics. How he keeps all his allies in good humour, remains to be seen.

Another problem that Akhilesh has is his inaccessibility. He mostly remains unavailable to party workers and also the media and no one in the party is authorised to take a call on his behalf.

Unlike Akhilesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav -- despite his advancing years, still picks up the phone on random basis and talks to senior journalists and party workers, especially old timers.

It is this that keeps still Mulayam clued into ground realities and also tuned in to emerging situations.

Adil, 19, and his friend were riding their scooters in Brussels when they encountered police officers on patrol. The officers were monitoring compliance with a lockdown Belgium had imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Adil’s friend sped off in one direction, Adil in another. A police car called in as reinforcement collided with Adil’s scooter, killing him instantly.

Adil is sadly one of a growing number of people who have died, not from the coronavirus itself, but as a consequence of police enforcement of outbreak-related restrictions.

I have been tracking police abuses and the misuse of emergency powers during the pandemic as part of the online monitoring project COVID State Watch. As lockdowns ease in some parts of the world, this other coronavirus death toll demands greater attention.

Police officers have harassed, abused, beaten and killed people in their efforts to enforce coronavirus-related curfews and lockdowns on nearly every continent.

Almost three weeks into the lockdown in Nigeria, more people had died at the hands of police enforcing coronavirus restrictions than from the virus itself. Videos of Indian police officers forcing migrant workers to hop and crawl along a road and attacking street vendors went viral. In the US, a group of seven police officers violently dragged a man off a bus for failing to wear a face mask. In France, the police came under fire for tasering a man standing outside his home for allegedly violating harsh lockdown requirements.

The extent of police violence unleashed under the pandemic is so vast that it prompted a statement this week from UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, denouncing the use of “excessive, and at times lethal, force to make people abide by lockdowns and curfews”.

“Shooting, detaining or abusing someone for breaking a curfew because they are desperately searching for food is clearly an unacceptable and unlawful response,” she added.

Just like the virus itself, enforcement of coronavirus restrictions is hitting marginalised groups the hardest. In Greece, asylum seekers and refugees have been violently assaulted by police monitoring a coronavirus lockdown. In Australia, public health infringement notices have been disproportionately issued in areas of Sydney with large immigrant and Indigenous populations.

A similar pattern has emerged in areas of France with large immigrant populations. Bolivian soldiers violently pushed back a group of mostly poor and Indigenous Bolivians trying to re-enter the country from Chile, citing the need to contain the pandemic. In South Africa, low-income neighbourhoods and townships bear the brunt of police and army brutality.

Heavy-handed policing of marginalised groups in the name of containing the pandemic comes as no surprise. Those who are routinely over-policed are naturally the first victims of any expansion of police power. This pattern is reinforced by the nature of coronavirus restrictions.

“Essential workers”, day labourers, street vendors – those who cannot afford to confine themselves to their homes – or those who live in crowded housing are more likely to be outside and subject to police checks. They are also more likely to be poor, minority ethnic, Indigenous or of other marginalised backgrounds. Police powers that are broad and vaguely worded encourage officers to use their own discretion, only exacerbating this problem.

The deadly, and often discriminatory, impact of coronavirus policing is probably much greater than we currently think. Through the COVID State Watch project, we have encountered hundreds of cases of ill-treatment and misconduct by police enforcing coronavirus restrictions.

But journalists, activists and NGOs only succeed in documenting a small fraction of cases of police abuse, even in the absence of the difficulties presented by the lockdown. Very few victims make official complaints and formal channels of information-gathering, such as freedom of information requests, face delays and obstruction due to the lockdown.

We only know the tip of the iceberg when it comes to police brutality and misconduct during the pandemic – but even this is enough to demand a rethink of the “law and order” approach to dealing with public health emergencies.

Police and army officers do not become qualified health workers through the signing of an emergency decree.

Egyptian authorities arrested three human rights activists in apparent retaliation for a meeting with senior Western diplomats, writes Tom Allinson for Deutsche Welle. Gasser Abdel Razek, the director of one of Egypt's most prominent civil rights bodies, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) and Mohamed Basheer, the administration manager of the organization, have been detained. The EIPR says security forces questioned Basheer on the group's work and a meeting it held with 13 mainly European diplomats on November 3, where members discussed human rights in Egypt. Authorities also arrested Karim Ennarah, the director of criminal justice at the EIPR.

(CNSNews.com) – The Biden administration has criticized the recent elevation of Syria and Belarus onto the executive board of the World Health Organization (WHO) – but when given the opportunity to raise objections or call for a recorded vote, neither the U.S. nor any other delegation did so.

At the State Department on Wednesday, deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said in response to a question that the administration had “grave concerns” about the “election” of the two countries for three-year terms on the 34-member executive board.

At a WHO executive board meeting in Geneva the same day, U.S. representative Amy Norris White expressed “grave concerns” that the two governments do not share the values required for members of the board – specifically, upholding “universal values and human rights.”

“In particular, we note Syria’s track record of conducting chemical weapons attacks harming civilians and striking medical facilities as well as first responders,” she said.

“The United States takes this opportunity to reinforce the expectation of members of the executive board and calls on the governments of both Belarus and Syria to respect human rights.”

The Bashar Assad and Alexander Lukashenko regimes were handed the seats last Friday, the closing day of the WHO’s annual World Health Assembly (WHA).

The “election,” as with many in U.N. system, did not actually involve a vote. Instead, WHA president Dechen Wangmo, the health minister of Bhutan, read out the names of 12 candidates for the 12 vacancies.

“If elected, these 12 members would provide a balanced distribution of the board as a whole,” she said, before reading out the names in alphabetical order: “Afghanistan, Belarus, Denmark, France, Japan, Malaysia, Paraguay, Peru, Rwanda, Slovenia, Syrian Arab Republic, and Timor-Leste.”

“Is the assembly prepared, in accordance with the rule 80 of the Rules of Procedure, to elect these 12 members as proposed?” she asked.

After waiting a couple of moments, Wangmo continued, “As I see no-one wishing to take the floor, I understand that there is no objection. I therefore declare the 12 member[s] elected.”

(Rule 80 says elections should “normally be held by secret ballot” but that “in the absence of any objection, the Health Assembly may decide to proceed without taking a ballot on an agreed candidate or list of candidates.”)

The 12 nominees were chosen and put forward by the WHA’s General Committee, a 25-member body formed on the opening day of the annual assembly.

This year’s General Committee, selected on the opening day of the WHA, included the United States.

“As a member of the General Committee, the United States had the ability to challenge any appointment to this board by calling for a vote,” House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) observed on Thursday. “Yet the Biden administration let the election go by consensus, only speaking out afterwards.”

“It is unconscionable the Biden administration tacitly approved Belarus and Syria’s election to the World Health Organization’s executive board by not formally calling for a vote and objecting to their candidacy,” he said.

“Assad has killed and tortured tens of thousands of Syrians, including using chemical weapons against them. Lukashenko’s illegitimate regime murders its people in the streets and recently scrambled a MiG to divert a commercial airliner to Minsk in order to arrest a journalist,” McCaul said.

“These despots do not belong anywhere near leadership positions in any United Nations body – especially the agency tasked with protecting the world’s health.

Queries sent to the State Department and the U.S. Mission in Geneva about the decision not to object or call for a recorded vote brought no response by press time.

‘Terrible message’

“Electing Syria to govern the world's top health body is like hiring a pyromaniac to be the town fire chief,” commented U.N. Watch executive director Hillel Neuer. “Syria’s Assad regime systematically bombs hospitals and clinics, killing doctors, nurses, and others as they care for the sick and injured.”

“Health professionals have also been arrested, disappeared, imprisoned, tortured and executed. Electing this murderous regime to govern the world’s top health body is an insult to Assad’s millions of victims, and sends a terrible message.”

John Connolly, whose bestselling book Filthy Rich was turned into a hit Netflix mini series, told The Sun: ""Ghislaine certainly knows things that implicate the Prince.""

Connolly also speculated that prosecutors will try to strike a deal with Maxwell in return for her testifying about Andrew's relationship with Epstein's underage sex slave, Virginia Giuffre.

Giuffre has alleged in a lawsuit she was recruited aged 16 by Maxwell at Trump's Palm Beach country club, Mar-a-Lago, and alleges she had sex with the Duke, who denies all allegations of wrongdoing.

Meanwhile author Barry Levine said Maxwell, who was arrested by the FBI on Thursday on child trafficking charges, will now ""open up a hornets nest"" for Epstein's powerful acquaintances including the Duke, President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton as she reveals what she knows.

""Ghislaine will be fighting for her freedom, anything to escape prosecution,"" Levine, who has written a book on Epstein, 'The Spider,' for Penguin/Random House, said.

""No doubt she'll be putting herself first and that opens up a hornet's nest if she names names.

""This bust is sending Prince Andrew a powerful message from prosecutors that everyone is fair game.

""I'd also think it couldn’t come at a worse time for President Trump and former President Clinton. Just their friendships alone with Ghislaine, having all that recycled, is something neither of them wants to see.

“And, of course, there are men and women — whose names have yet to be made public — who are quaking in their boots for fear Ghislaine could link them to this sordid mess.

""Like her late father Robert Maxwell, who was fixated on control, Ghislaine right now doesn’t have any — and she's going to fight tooth and nail to regain that control. Naming names is certainly one way to do that.""

Conolly is now writing a second book about Epstein, called The Virus, which he says will expose others in the case.

“Epstein’s nickname in Florida was The Virus,” he added.

“The wife of an insurance executive who introduced Epstein to [billionaire businessman] Les Wexner hated Epstein and called him the Virus because he infected everyone with whom he came into contact.”

He also speculates the timing of Thursday's bust at Maxwell's $1million New Hampshire hideout was ""not coincidental"".

He claims sources told him that a reason Trump fired powerful New York prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, was because Trump didn't want Prince Andrew to testify.""

Berman’s successor, Audrey Strauss, has denied the claims and said that the timing of Maxwell's arrest was “not at all” related to Trump’s firing of Berman.

Prosecutors have said they kept an eye on Maxwell's whereabouts in the last year and arrested her when the indictment was ""ready.” The Sun reached out to the US Justice Department for comment.

Many of Epstein and Maxwell's alleged co-conspirators have been named and tracked down in recent years, but many have vanished, some even changing their names to escape the scandal.

Others have tried to distance themselves from the case.

Clinton has acknowledged taking four trips on Epstein’s plane, but has previously said he was completely unaware of the “terrible crimes” committed by the financier, who killed himself last year.

Trump once described Epstein as a ""terrific guy"" but changed his tune after Epstein was convicted of child sex crimes in 2008, saying he “knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him.""

“I had a falling out with him. I haven’t spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,” he added.

Prince Andrew who has been accused of having sex with an underage girl he was introduced to by Epstein, has always vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has joined the many voices expressing their support for Zimbabweans amid protests in the country.

Zimbabweans have taken to the streets to protest against alleged state corruption and the country’s slumping economy.

The government has denounced the protests, calling them an “insurrection”. As a result, the country’s citizens, including author Tsitsi Dangarembga, were arrested and charged with incitement to commit violence and breaching anti-coronavirus health regulations.

Dangarembga has since been freed on bail.

The country’s government has been widely criticised, with social media users shedding light on the protests using the hashtag #ZimbabweanLivesMatter.

Amnesty International has also joined those who condemned the crackdown on protests and dissent.

“This latest witch-hunt and repression of peaceful dissent is a continuation of what we have seen in the country in recent years, including the abductions and arbitrary arrests of those who are critical of the government,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Southern Africa.

“The brutal assault on political activists and human rights defenders who have had the courage to call out alleged corruption and demand accountability from their government is intensifying,” she said.

In a statement on Monday evening, the EFF called for the Zimbabwean Embassy in South Africa to be removed until “they restore the human rights in that country”.

“Failure to do so will result in direct action by EFF to prevent any official from the Zimbabwean government from participating in any gathering in SA until they respect ordinary Zimbabweans,” the party said, receiving praise from both South Africans and Zimbabweans, who commended it for taking a stand.

The EFF leader and the Zimbabwean Embassy in South Africa have, in the past few days, been engaged in a bitter exchange of words after his party released a statement questioning the country’s political and economic logic for compensating white former land owners.

Last week, Zimbabwe announced a US$3.5 billion compensation for 4,000 white farmers whose farms were confiscated.

However, according to the EFF, the compensation meant government had declared the people of Zimbabwe as enemies.

“The Zimbabwean government, which is currently engaged in the torture, incarceration, sexual assault and victimisation of protesters has no moral authority or standing to claim to speak on behalf of the people of Zimbabwe. This government, which is compensating land thieves for land which was acquired through a revolutionary process has declared the people of Zimbabwe as enemies, through the deployment of the military to suppress genuine protest.

“The EFF does not owe Zanu-PF any allegiance, and we have now identified them as part of long line of oppressive regimes and failing liberation movements which no longer have a vision for the continent,” said the EFF in a statement.

In response, the Embassy accused the “pretentious” EFF of attempting to rewrite history by distancing late Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe from the agreement to compensate white farmers.

“We cannot remain silent in the face of the EFF’s pretentiousness to know more about the history and politics of Zimbabwe than the Zimbabweans themselves. Even more, the EFF has the audacity to dare teach Zimbabweans, even our head of state about the land question in our country.

“The signing of this global compensation agreement is a significant step in the coming together of Zimbabweans in efforts to bring to finality a long outstanding, highly emotive and divisive issue. This agreement should be welcomed by those who genuinely wish Zimbabwe well.

“It is our expectation that the EFF and others who may wish to comment on the land issues in Zimbabwe do so from an informed, objective and constructive standpoint that respects the people of Zimbabwe’s struggles and sacrifices for their land and contributes to the unity and progress of the country,” said the Embassy.

He had always been outspoken and he remained outspoken in prison, where he wrote a collection of essays and a novel. He has now been awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for his tireless dedication. By Gerrit Wustmann

Abdulhamid II, the last sultan prior to the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, was heralded as a reformer when he took the throne, but became a decadent, paranoid despot who imagined plotters in every corner, had his spies trained on everything and everyone, and was firmly in the grip of his own control-freakery. He rebuilt the state and its administration, ensuring that all the reins were in his hands. His enormous nose made him a target for caricaturists, who put about that his nose was a sight to behold. When he sensed an attempted coup, he struck out mercilessly at those around him.

“The great waves of arrests which took place the following morning saw a number of pashas and hundreds of lower-ranking officers taken from their homes and placed in Balmumcu military barracks. (…) And fear, which lurked in Istanbul like an ogre raising its head above the ground from time to time, spread like a plague. Civilians were denounced and arrested too. Anyone could report on their enemies by claiming they were in the service of Fuat Pasha.”

Replace Fuat Pasha with Fethullah Gulen, Abdulhamid II with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the passage above reads very much like a newspaper article from the summer of 2016, when a failed coup attempt moved to bring down the Turkish government. But this text is not from 2016; it is from 1998 and it is not from a history book, but Ahmet Altan’s novel Like a Sword Wound (translated into English by Brendan Freely and Yelda Turedi, Europa Editions 2018).

A victim of the countercoup

Together with his brother Mehmet Altan and the journalist Nazli Ilicak, Altan was arrested just days after that fateful night of the 15th of July in the course of nationwide raids against the government’s opponents. Taraf, the daily newspaper founded by Altan, was also banned. He was accused of supporting those orchestrating the coup because he had dared to criticise the governing AKP and President Erdogan on a television programme broadcast the day before the coup. Altan is just one of tens of thousands of people to have fallen victim to this countercoup; to date, more than a hundred journalists have been imprisoned – more than in any other country worldwide.

In an essay, Altan recalls the parallels between his sentence and that of the protagonist in Like a Sword Wound. Like his protagonist, he sits restless in the examination room and waits for the judgement; words like ‘future’ and ‘fate’ disintegrate, his old life collapses in on itself. “My life’s aping my novel!” Altan writes in I will never see the world again. The Memoir of an Imprisoned Writer (translated into English by Yasemin Congar, Granta 2018).

A politically motivated decision

The judgement for Altan ordered difficult conditions for life. This meant solitary confinement. In a high-security prison in Silivri near Istanbul. This prison, it was claimed, could produce the best newspaper in the country, because the most important journalists and intellectuals in Turkey were confined there. Can Dundar was imprisoned here, as was Deniz Yucel. And the judgement against Altan was announced on the same day that Yucel was set free, which once again highlighted that lawful judgements were no longer being made here; these were political statements. Meanwhile, Altan was cleared of his conviction by the Supreme Court of Appeals Penal Chamber, which has recently dared to stand against the will of the presidential palace. But the criminal court in Istanbul intervened, opened new proceedings and Altan was initially obliged to remain behind bars.

This November, Ahmet Altan will receive the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for his essay collection. “This politically-motivated sentence robbed one of Turkey’s critical commentator of his freedom,” the jury explained in its justification for awarding Altan the prize. “In a situation where his freedom had been taken from him, Ahmet Altan asserts his inner freedom in a moving, courageous way. The texts, written in dialogue with world literature, document his resistance and intellectual independence.” Ultimately, literature shows itself to be stronger than any arbitrary form of justice.

As winter approaches, Alberta labs working to reduce wait times, delays for medical testing Photo by Gavin Young/Postmedia As Alberta labs continue to complete thousands of COVID-19 tests daily, delays for access to general lab services have been impacted with non-urgent bookings being pushed up to three to five weeks. When checking the Alberta Precision Lab website to book a general lab work appointment in Calgary on Sunday, almost every location had no appointments available until the second week of November. This is because APL’s service centres and collection locations are currently operating at approximately 79 per cent of pre-pandemic capacity, according to Alberta Health Services in a statement to Postmedia.

Article content “We are aware of concerns over wait times and delays for lab testing, and AHS and APL are pursuing innovative approaches provincially to return to pre-pandemic capacity and services for regular testing,” said AHS. “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, patients who required urgent lab work have continued to receive it. However, some laboratory services were affected as APL ramped up testing for COVID-19, a key part of Alberta’s pandemic response.” Read more. How the White House is trying to convince America that Trump’s illness isn’t a big deal Photo by Joyce N. Boghosia/The White House/Handout via REUTERS This video wasn’t released simply as a matter of course. It followed reports earlier in the day that Trump had been in more dire condition on Friday than the White House at first let on. The New York Times reports that the revelation that Trump had been more ill than was originally suggested “infuriated” the president, prompting him to first encourage his attorney Rudy Giuliani to pass a message about his vitality to the New York Post and, later, to make a similar point publicly himself.

Article content In other words, Trump himself wanted to show the world how healthy he was, something that wouldn’t be aided by an on-camera cough. (His doctors have publicly acknowledged that Trump has been experiencing a cough, a common symptom of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.) Trump’s team also released photos of him apparently working from the presidential facility at Walter Reed. In one, he’s seen in the same room and outfit as in the released video. In a second image, he’s in another room, sitting at a conference table without a jacket and with numerous folders and papers in front of him.Here, too, there is a bit of sleight-of-hand at play. The photos give the impression that Trump was working for an extended period, that these photos capture various moments over the course of the day.

Two men who had died at the hands of Haitian police and 15 others under suspicion ""may have belonged to the national army"" of Colombia, having left it between 2018 and 2020, general Jorge Luis Vargas told a press conference.

Moise was shot dead in a pre-dawn attack Wednesday by a 28-member hit squad made up of 26 Colombians and two Americans of Haitian origin, according to Port-au-Prince. The president's wife, Martine, was wounded.

The Colombian authorities provided no further information on the men's army careers or the reason for their departure from service.

Two of the suspects flew from Bogota to Panama on May 6 and from there to Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic, where they stayed four days before taking a flight to Haiti, according to Vargas.

The other Colombians arrived in the Dominican Republic -- which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti -- on June 4, and travelled to Port-au-Prince two days later.

Colombia has said it has information on four companies' involvement in the crime, without giving further detail.

President Ivan Duque earlier announced that Colombia will send an intelligence mission to Haiti to aid in the investigation.

Haiti's police chief Leon Charles has said three members of the hit squad were killed by police and 17 taken into custody. Eight remain at large.

Colombia's El Tiempo newspaper said among those arrested was Manuel Antonio Grosso Guarin, 40, one of the country's most experienced soldiers.

Another was Francisco Eladio Uribe, who, according to his partner, left the army in 2019 after a 20-year career.",[],"['Thought', 'Involved', 'Haitian', 'President', 'Assasination']",set(),[],2021-07-09 19:15:39+00:00,,,True,2.0,,"Colombia's El Tiempo newspaper said among those arrested was Manuel Antonio Grosso Guarin, 40, one of the country's most experienced soldiers",en,/apple-touch-icon.png,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/world/17-colombian-ex-soldiers-thought-involved-in-haiti-assassination-3467696,<Element div at 0x7f49ca8f5130>,<Element div at 0x7f4c46d9b040>,<Element html at 0x7f4c48ea7400>,<Element html at 0x7f4c48ea7bd0>,{},0e14e5f5f6ddd0ce9fa6ad5126b7b096.1652017655.3777447,gdelt_events,08-05-2022,1f3ba4c2-196f-f7bd-17fb-dc6a654d8628,2021_07_01-2021_08_31_gdelt_data.csv

J.B. Pritzker and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton in the 2022 elections.

Monday was the deadline for candidates to turn in their nominating petitions to the Illinois State Board of Elections to get their names on the June 28 primary ballot.

Candidates who were in line at 8 a.m. on the first day of filing, March 7, will enter a lottery for a chance to have their names listed first on the ballot. But those who filed in the final hour before 5 p.m. Monday, March 14, have a chance to be listed last on the ballot.

The State Board of Elections has until Monday, March 21, to certify the petitions. In the meantime, candidates and party officials may try to challenge other candidates’ petition signatures.

Among the last to file in the governor’s race were Republicans Jesse Sullivan, of Petersburg, a political newcomer and owner of the venture capital firm Alter Global LLC, and his running mate Kathleen Murphy, of Warrenville. Murphy is a former spokeswoman for former state Rep. and 2018 GOP gubernatorial hopeful Jeanne Ives.

Their opposition includes Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin and his running mate, state Rep. Avery Bourne, of Morrisonville. They join other teams of candidates who filed earlier: state Sen. Darren Bailey, of Xenia, and his running mate Stephanie Trussel of Lisle; Bull Valley businessman Gary Rabine and his running mate Aaron Del Mar of Palatine; former state Sen. Paul Schimpf, of Waterloo, and his running mate Carolyn Schofield of Crystal Lake; and the team of Emily Johnson, of Wheaton, and Bret Mahlen, of Orland Park, members of the group We Are the People Illinois, which has called for investigations into unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 elections. The website for the group identifies it as consisting of “over 200 people.”

Another late filer Monday was GOP gubernatorial candidate Max Solomon, of Hazel Crest, and his running mate, Latasha Fields, of Chicago. According to his website, Solomon is a native of Nigeria who now practices law in the Chicago area, while Fields is the founder of Christian Home Educators Support System.

One other GOP candidate, Keisha Smith, of Country Club Hills, filed for governor without a running mate, something that a State Board of Elections spokesman said could be grounds for objection and disqualification because state law requires candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to run as a team.

Pritzker and Stratton also face one challenge from within their own party, Beverly Miles, a nurse and U.S. Army veteran from Chicago, and her running mate Karla Shaw.

CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS: Illinois voters this year will also choose candidates for other constitutional offices. The most contentious of those will likely be for the office of secretary of state, where incumbent Jesse White is stepping down after six terms in office.

On the Democratic side, former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias and Chicago City Clerk Anna Valencia appear to be the leading candidates, while Chicago Alderman David Moore and charity director Sidney Moore, of Homewood, are also in the race.

On the Republican side, former U.S. Attorney John Milhiser, of Springfield, and state Rep. Dan Brady, of Bloomington, are competing for the nomination. Also in the race is former Chicago police officer Michelle Turney, who also affiliates with the group We Are The People Illinois.

In the race for attorney general, three Republicans have lined up to challenge incumbent Democrat Kwame Raoul. They include Thomas DeVore, the southern Illinois lawyer best known for his lawsuits challenging Pritzker’s COVID-19 mitigations; Deerfield attorney Steve Kim; and David Shestokas, a former assistant state’s attorney for Cook County who is a hearing officer for the Chicago Board of Elections.

In the race for state treasurer, Republican state Rep. Tom Demmer, of Dixon, and Lake Bluff resident Patrice McDermand, also of We Are The People Illinois, will vie to challenge incumbent Democrat Michael Frerichs.

And in the race for Illinois comptroller, Republicans Shannon Teresi, a certified public accountant from Crystal Lake, and Michael Kinney, of Carol Stream, will compete for the nomination to challenge incumbent Democrat Susana Mendoza.

New Delhi: In the wake of reports that the historic Nankana Sahib Gurdwara and Sikh pilgrims visiting it were targeted by a stone-pelting Pakistani mob in Pakistani Punjab, India on Friday lashed out at the “vandalism” there and “strongly condemned these wanton acts of destruction and desecration of the holy place”. India asked Pakistan “to take immediate steps to ensure the safety, security, and welfare of the members of the Sikh community,” to take “strong action against the miscreants who indulged in desecration of the holy Gurdwara and attacked members of the minority Sikh community” and also “to take all measures to protect and preserve the sanctity of the holy Nankana Sahib Gurdwara and its surroundings”. New Delhi said these “reprehensible actions followed the forcible abduction and conversion of Jagjit Kaur, the Sikh girl who was kidnapped from her home in the city of Nankana Sahib in August last year”. According to news agency reports from Chandigarh, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh appealed to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan to ensure that the devotees stranded at the Nankana Sahib Gurudwara were rescued from the mob.

The Gurdwara in Pakistani Punjab is especially revered as Nankana Sahib is the birthplace of Guru Nanak.

According to some media reports, the violent mob was led by the members of the Muslim family that had abducted the Sikh girl in September last year. Following tremendous pressure, the girl was returned to her family soon after the reported intervention then by the Pakistan Government.

In a statement on Friday, the MEA said, “We are concerned at the vandalism carried out at the revered Nankana Sahib Gurudwara today. Members of the minority Sikh community have been subjected to acts of violence in the holy city of Nankana Sahib.”

The MEA added, “India strongly condemns these wanton acts of destruction and desecration of the holy place.

The Zimbabwean government has hired a fourth lobby and public relations (PR) firm in a desperate bid to spruce up its battered international image and bolster the diplomatic re-engagement drive that has fallen off the rails amid a growing backlash over the deteriorating human rights situation in the country, the Zimbabwe Independent can report.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration has engaged London-based BTP Advisers–which joins United States-based Mercury International Limited, Ballard Partners and Avenue Strategies–in a quest to help Zimbabwe return to the community of nations after decades of isolation.

The company has also been tasked with communicating to stakeholders about the circumstances under which Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors’ Association leader Peter Magombeyi was allegedly abducted.

In a briefing by BTP Advisers to world media at the instigation of Foreign Affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo on behalf of government last week, Harare blamed local media houses and other pressure groups for peddling falsehoods on Magombeyi’s alleged abduction.

A press release issued by BTP following the engagement distanced government from Magombeyi’s abduction, which the firm said had frustrated the re-engagement programme.

“These incidents do nothing to assist, and only seek to obstruct the government’s genuine and open-minded efforts to engage with the international community on behalf of the Zimbabwean people,” the firm said in a statement dated September 20.

“Given this fact, the government expresses its frustration at the ongoing, instant reaction by those in the international media alluding to government involvement in these disappearances. We ask the media to spend less time insinuating and more time investigating how and who may benefit and be behind them.

“The government calls for all parties to come to the table and discuss this dispute in the spirit of openness and mutual respect. The government is concerned that the timings of a spate of disappearances–followed by reappearances–of civil society and labour activists on the eve of major international meetings of crucial importance to the whole country are forming a pattern.”

BTP, a public relations firm whose senior management has close links to the Liberal Democrats, has in the past worked with Rwandan President Paul Kagame and successfully led a campaign to exonerate Kagame from the 1994 genocide.

A 2009 report from the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative acknowledged that the BTP’s “excellent public relations machinery” had succeeded in hiding “the exclusionary and repressive nature of the regime” in Kigali.

BTP advised Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta during his dispute with opposition leader Raila Odinga after the 2014 elections.

The company also ran Kenyatta’s PR campaign when he was facing charges from the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. He was charged for his role in the violence that erupted during the 2007 Kenyan elections, where more than 1 200 people were killed while 300 000 were displaced.

In February, Zimbabwe spent US$500 000 on US-based lobby firm Ballard to canvass for the removal of targeted sanctions imposed on the southern African country. Brian Ballard, a senior partner in the firm, was part of President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign and is part of the Trump re-election bid.

Ballard has a large African clientele that includes Moise Katumbi, the opposition leader in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who feared being jailed by former President Joseph Kabila and went into exile in 2016.

In June, government engaged Avenue Strategies Global LLC, at a fee of US$1 million, to lobby the US government to drop sanctions against the southern African nation.

Government also recently engaged US firm Mercury International Limited in a contract which will run until May 31, 2020. Moyo is cited in the contract form which is undersigned by Counsel Leonardo Dosoretz.

Washington D.C., over controversies like journalists allegedly being under surveillance by the Justice Department.

This case takes place in Rockingham, 90 minutes east of Charlotte, at The Richmond County Daily Journal. The newspaper publishes two days a week and has only a couple of reporters. It shares a small building with a copying and printing store.

Brian Bloom, the publisher since 2019, has big expectations.

“I sat down with them and said the last Pulitzer Prize was won by a newspaper in Storm Lake, Iowa, that had three people,” Bloom said during a recent interview in his office. “A father and two sons. Just because we’re small doesn’t mean we can’t be good.”

While Bloom wanted to be known for investigative reporting, his small paper has made national news for a different reason.

In early 2020, the news editor, Gavin Stone, was reprimanded by a judge for taking a cellphone photo in court.

About 18 months later, Stone assigned rookie reporter Matthew Slasser to cover a murder trial. The publisher said Stone remembered the ban on cellphones, but mistakenly thought Slasser could bring a voice recorder inside the courtroom to help his notetaking.

Bloom said a bailiff saw Slasser’s recorder and told Superior Court Judge Stephan Futrell, who is not the same judge who reprimanded Stone for the photo.

Steve Harrison/WFAE / Brian Bloom is the publisher of the Richmond County Daily Journal

“The judge ordered, ‘Stop the murder trial’ and told Matthew that he needed to leave the courtroom and take the recorder with him, which Matthew did,” Bloom said. “And he came back here fairly shaken but not overly so.”

Superior Court rules generally allow electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings, but media outlets often have to ask for permission first. And judges can choose to prohibit the technology.

Later that day, the newspaper got a call from a bailiff, summoning Stone and Slasser. They thought it would be an informal discussion with Futrell about what happened, Bloom said.

“And instead of meeting in chambers and without anybody’s knowledge (the judge) had convened a hearing,” Bloom said.

He said the two staff members asked if they need a lawyer, and were told no.

Then Futrell fined Slasser $500 for criminal contempt of court. Stone was sentenced to five days in jail.

Bloom said the reporter made a mistake, but he said jailing the news editor went too far. At the appeal, Bloom said Futrell was angry.

“When I went for the appeal hearing (he) was a man who was spewing anger, literally spitting anger, making comments that were completely inappropriate and without any basis of fact,” Bloom said. “And he was adamant he was going to get his inch of flesh.”

Bloom said Stone and Slasser are not doing interviews. WFAE couldn’t reach Futrell, who has also declined to comment for other media outlets.

Stone was released from jail after a day, but the case is pending. The Stanly County district attorney is now handling the case and a court date is set for later this month.

Sarah Matthews, an attorney with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the Richmond County case is unusual — but not unprecedented.

“It stands out in the sense that an editor who wasn’t even the one making the recording was jailed,” she said. “That’s how this is quite unusual.”

In 2018, freelance journalist Zachary Siegel was arrested while covering the murder trial of a Chicago police officer in the shooting of Laquan McDonald. The judge said he had recorded part of the trial.

Matthews said the Richmond County case is troubling.

“And also I would say just the immediate sentencing was pretty harsh and excessive,” Matthews said.

Futrell was appointed to the bench Gov. Roy Cooper in 2018.

Last month, Bryan Anderson from the Associated Press asked Cooper whether he’s concerned about the judge’s actions.

“I’m curious if you plan on reporting that to the judicial standards commission?” Anderson asked during a news conference. “We asked your office a couple of weeks ago and we’re still looking for a comment from you.”

The case has received national attention, but Cooper said he didn’t know about it.

“I don’t know the situation involving that,” Cooper said. “I know that our courts should be as open as possible, but I do know that the court has certain rules it can implement.”

Anderson asked whether the governor would encourage courts to be more open. ",[],[''],{'Political Redistricting'},"['Wfae', ""Steve Harrison Is Wfae'S Politics"", 'Government Reporter.

Provided by Al Jazeera The winning scratchcard is reportedly being held by a court in Bruges [File: Thomas Coex/AFP]

An Algerian national deemed to be staying without documents in Belgium is battling to claim a 250,000-euro ($270,000) jackpot won on a scratchcard, with authorities insisting it can be paid only if he can prove his identity.

“My client is in an illegal situation, he has no papers and no bank account,” Alexander Verstraete, a lawyer for the 28-year-old, told the AFP news agency on Friday.

“We are looking for those documents that can prove his identity. He will have to contact his family in Algeria.”

Verstraete said the winning scratchcard was currently being held by a court in the city of Bruges after three friends tried to claim it unsuccessfully on his client’s behalf.

The friends, also from North Africa, were detained for a night by police on suspicion of theft before being released when the real winner came forward with his lawyer.

The winning ticket was bought a few weeks ago in Zeebrugge. The Belgian port city is a popular destination for migrants and refugees trying to reach England hidden in trucks or containers.

Verstraete said his client, who does not intend to apply for asylum to stay in Belgium, had obtained a promise from the authorities that he would not be deported until he had received his prize.

The prize is the jackpot of a scratchcard sold for five euros ($5.5), which offers a “one in 3.69 chance” of winning some sort of payout, according to the national lottery website.

The retailer who sold the ticket is prohibited from giving out such a prize in cash.

For any prize of more than 100,000 euros ($108,000), the winner must go to the company’s headquarters in Brussels, said Joke Vermoere, spokeswoman for the national lottery.

That is where the winner’s three friends went.

“The winner did not show up at our place, we have not seen him, which is blocking the procedure for the awarding of the prize for the time being,” said Vermoere.

She did not specify the conditions or the nature of the documents required to claim the win.

“It is in the hands of the public prosecutor’s office in Bruges,” she said.",[],[''],{'War in Ukraine'},[],,,,True,2.0,,"The winning ticket was bought in Zeebrugge, a port city and popular transit point for migrants and refugees.",en,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/15/undocumented-algerian-fights-to-claim-belgium-lotto-win,<Element div at 0x7fc4ed7ea0e0>,<Element div at 0x7fc4ed81e9f0>,<Element html at 0x7fc4ed826180>,<Element html at 0x7fc4ed826950>,{},58e4be483b557af6ebe2fbb95d0cb485.1651829116.7773752,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,3ea49f19-c6ea-22f7-d877-f3d214c2772a,2022_03_01-2022_05_06_gdelt_data.csv

Stop arresting reporters for doing their job.

That was one of many tweets I sent out before the clock even hit 7:30 a.m. Friday.

The news, locally, this week has been busy; nationally, too. Despite my unusually early wake up, I was glad to have reached the end of a very hectic week.

It was a good Friday for about five minutes.

Then I saw the video of CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his production crew getting arrested while doing their jobs, covering ongoing protests in Minneapolis in the wake of the death of George Floyd after his arrest by Minneapolis officers. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told CNN he expects “there will be charges” against the four officers involved in Floyd’s death.

Jimenez, along with producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez, were arrested on live television shortly after 6 a.m.

It was 6:52 a.m. I was awake and I was angry.

My brain took me back to Bridgeport on the night of May 9, 2019. For my own sanity, I won’t rehash all the details surrounding my arrest.

But here’s the thing: I was on the sidewalk. I was doing my job. I identified myself. I didn’t have a crew — no other media were there at that point actually because our photographer had just left about 10 minutes prior.

I got arrested while my phone filmed the entire thing, capturing mostly just the audio as two sergeants pulled my arms back and put cuffs on my wrists.

Like Jimenez and his crew, there was no immediate reason given for my arrest.

CNN president Jeff Zucker spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Friday morning after the team’s arrest, according to CNN. Walz apologized to Zucker for the arrests and said he was working to have them released immediately.

Hearst Connecticut Media’s then-Vice President of News Matt DeRienzo had a call with Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim after my arrest — I’m sure much like the conversation Zucker had with Walz. Like Walz, Ganim apologized. He said he was encouraging police officials to release me.

In a statement later Friday, Minnesota State Patrol said: “In the course of clearing the streets and restoring order at Lake Street and Snelling Avenue, four people were arrested by State Patrol troopers, including three members of a CNN crew. The three were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.”

The city of Bridgeport released a similar statement after my arrest.

Walz said the Minneapolis arrests were “unacceptable,” CNN reported. They were.

The team was released from the Hennepin County Public Safety facility in downtown Minneapolis around 7 a.m.

Before their arrests, Jimenez was standing in front of a long line of police officers in riot gear, when the officers moved toward Jimenez and his crew and asked them to move.

It was all on camera.

Jimenez told the officers he and his three colleagues were part of a CNN crew and identified himself with his CNN identification card, CNN reports.

“We can move back to where you'd like,” Jimenez is heard saying. “We can move back to where you'd like here. We are live on the air at the moment. This is the four of us. We are one team. Just put us back where you want us. We're getting out of your way. So, just let us know. Wherever you'd want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection. Let us know and we've got you.”

At 5:11 a.m. local time — 6:11 a.m. here in Connecticut — two officers in riot gear stepped up to Jimenez and said, “you are under arrest.” Jimenez asked why. He was handcuffed and led away by the officers.

Again, the camera and the live audience watching this unfold, caught it all. It felt all too familiar for me.

U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, an organization that highlights violations against journalists, said at least 40 journalists have been arrested while covering protests since 2017. Nine journalists were arrested in 2019.

Two journalists have been arrested so far this year, according to the organization’s data, which has not yet been updated to include the CNN arrests.

The data shows at least eight journalists have been attacked, at least five have had equipment damaged, at least six have faced access denials and at least eight have been served subpoenas or legal orders. I say “at least” because there’s no guarantee every incident is reported on.

Mr. Quiñones was imprisoned on charges of ""resistance"" and ""disobedience."" These alleged acts occurred in April 2019, when he was detained and beaten without cause for covering a politically-charged trial of homeschooling parents in Guantánamo.

Quiñones Matter Summary

Roberto de Jesús Quiñones Haces, like many freethinkers, has suffered several decades of the Cuban regime's persecution. In the past, he has been blocked from traveling abroad and has undergone multiple unlawful searches-and-seizures and detentions.

On April 22, 2019, Mr. Quiñones was arrested at the Guantánamo courthouse and beaten for five days. He had been covering the trial of Pastors Rigal and Expósito for homeschooling, for CubaNet. Radio Martí has a recording of Mr. Quiñones speaking about the beating he received here, and ADN Cuba shows photo evidence of his attack in a profile of the case here.

In June 2019, GLA agreed to work on Mr. Quiñones's behalf. On August 1, he was cited for refusing to pay a fine for his alleged misbehavior. This was the day after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed his concern for Mr. Quiñones in a phone interview.

Mr. Quiñones appealed his first sentence from house arrest. This appeal was rejected and he was imprisoned on September 11. On April 1, 2020, One Free Press and the Committee to Protect Journalists featured Mr. Quiñones as one of several journalists worldwide who was unjustly imprisoned.

In support of Mr. Quiñones and his long-suffering family, and since there is no legal reason to have detained him to begin with, GLA demands the Cuban regime release Mr. Quiñones immediately. The GLA shall redouble its efforts to defend him and also hold to account those involved in the unlawful imprisonment of Mr. Quiñones.

The Global Liberty Alliance is committed to defending fundamental rights and the rule of law, including the fundamental right to freedom of speech. You can find more information about the work that GLA is doing on our blog, our Facebook page, or our Twitter account.

“Plainclothes security forces have raided Mada Masr´s office in Cairo. Staff are currently being held inside, and their phones have been switched off,” the independent news site posted on Twitter. The raid comes after Shady Zalat, 37, a news editor who has worked since 2014 at the prominent website was arrested from his home on Saturday.

Mada Masr publishes investigations into corruption and security issues in Arabic and English. It published an explosive article last week alleging that President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi´s son Mahmoud had been transferred to Moscow on a diplomatic posting.

His re-assignment from a senior intelligence post came after he had been criticised internally within the security apparatus, Mada Masr reported. The article, which cited unnamed Emirati and Egyptian officials, gave details about the country´s security agencies at a time when press freedoms in Egypt are shrinking.

Good question. The short answer is nothing; my wife is innocent. What happened is this: she and I hired a car to visit her family for Thanksgiving and dropped it off in Boston at 9am. The company – which I won’t name because I don’t want it to set its lawyers on me – said we returned it at 9pm and insisted we pay them an extra $350. We said: “Hell, no,” so it referred us to debt collectors who hounded us for weeks. This could have had a terrible knock-on effect on our credit score and ability to get a mortgage, but a lawyer friend helped us get the issue dropped – except we hadn’t realised the company had banned my wife from ever using it or its many subsidiaries again. (Which we would never do by choice – however, rental car costs have gone up 43% and it was the cheapest option.)

Being banned for life from a major car rental company is inconvenient, but our situation, which I strongly suspect was caused by a computer glitch, could have been far worse. Hertz is being sued by hundreds of US customers who allege they were wrongfully arrested after the rental company reported them to the police for stealing cars they say they had legitimately rented. A Nasa employee, who is part of the lawsuit, was allegedly arrested at gunpoint after Hertz reported the vehicle he had rented was stolen. One woman spent 40 days in jail – away from her kids and two-month-old baby – because she was arrested for car theft. Another customer spent seven months in jail and eventually signed a plea deal just to bring the ordeal to an end.

The allegations against Hertz have been public since 2019, but the case is back in the news because a judge recently ordered Hertz to unseal documents that show the company filed more than 3,300 police reports about stolen vehicles involving its customers each year. (Hertz had been trying to argue those numbers were “trade secrets” and should be kept confidential). As USA Today noted in a new in-depth piece on the issue: “That means over the past seven years since false theft report cases have been known to occur, theft charges have been levied against more than 23,000 people. How many of them were innocent paying customers is unknown.”

What exactly is going on? Nothing, according to Hertz. The company has described the accusations as baseless; it argues theft reports are “rare and happen only after exhaustive attempts to reach the customer”. The lawyers in the class action, meanwhile, argue that Hertz has a faulty computer system and can’t keep track of its inventory; instead of investigating “missing” cars itself, they say it outsources the work to police stations. The police, by the way, aren’t always thrilled about this – according to USA Today, court records show that “after multiple reports of stolen vehicles that ended up being located on Hertz’s lots, [some police] agencies reportedly said they wouldn’t take new reports from the company”.

Obviously I don’t know all the facts in the ongoing Hertz lawsuit. But the case has striking parallels with the UK’s Post Office scandal, where hundreds of postal workers were accused of theft due to a faulty computer system designed by Fujitsu; scores of lives were ruined because management trusted technology over low-paid workers. It’s not just technology that is to blame, of course – it’s an economic and legal system that protects and prioritises corporations over people.

Members of Canada's House of Commons on Wednesday unanimously voted to grant citizenship to Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who has been imprisoned in his home country since 2012 and whose wife and three children live in Canada.

The motion asks Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino to use his ""discretionary power"" to grant Canadian citizenship to Badawi, ""in order to remedy a particular situation and unusual distress.""

He was convicted in 2014 to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for ""insulting Islam."" He received 50 of those beatings in January 2015, but the rest of the sessions -- which were to be carried out weekly -- were suspended after a global outcry.

Badawi, an outspoken defender of freedom of expression, had called for the end of religious rule under Wahhabism -- a rigid interpretation of Islam -- in Saudi Arabia.

""Now that this is a formal request from the House, (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau and Minister Marco Mendicino must act,"" Yves-Francois Blanchet, head of the separatist Bloc Quebecois party and sponsor of the bill, said after the vote.

""Every day counts"" for Badawi, ""as his health is constantly in danger in prison,"" Blanchet said in a statement.

Relations between Ottawa and Riyadh deteriorated in the summer of 2018 when the Canadian government called for the release of Saudi human rights activists, including Badawi's sister Samar Badawi.

Badawi's wife and three children, who live in Quebec, have already received Canadian citizenship.

Clashes broke out between BJP workers and the West Bengal Police in Kolkata on Thursday as BJP workers tried to break through police barricades during their march towards Bengal secretariat 'Nabanna'.

Thousands of BJP workers from Kolkata and Howrah began marching towards Nabanna to protest the ""worsening"" law and order in the state, on Thursday afternoon. The West Bengal Police, however, blocked the march and police personnel resorted to lathi-charge, used tear gas and water cannons on BJP workers at Santragachi in Howrah district.

""The police is lathi charging our people...stone-pelting being done from Khidirpur side. Can't the police see that?"" BJP leader Locket Chatterjee was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

Several BJP leaders, including BJP state vice-president Raju Banerjee and MP Jyotirmoy Singh Mahato, have reportedly been injured.

Chaotic scenes were witnessed as BJP workers retaliated by hurling stones at cops. Following West Bengal Police's crackdown, BJP workers also set ablaze tires in Howrah during the party's state-wide agitation.

On BJP’s holding a big march even as the state is battling coronavirus pandemic, BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said, “All workers are wearing masks. Are rules only for us? Mamata ji holds demonstrations with thousands and we're being taught lessons of social distancing.”

“Do the same rules not apply to her?” Kailash Vijayvargiya asked.

We are protesting democratically, but Mamata Ji has tried to turn our peaceful demonstration into a violent protest. Goons along with police pelted stones at us: BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya in Kolkata https://t.co/MulZaJB486 pic.twitter.com/Cc3uPhblwr — ANI (@ANI) October 8, 2020

BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya claimed, “We are protesting democratically, but Mamata ji has tried to turn our peaceful demonstration into a violent protest. Goons along with police hurled stones at us.”

The BJP, however, later called of their protest after two hours. A BJP leader told India Today that the party decided to suspend the march for the day, while adding that the massive protests will be seen in days to come.

The West Bengal government had earlier cited the Covid-19 pandemic to deny permission for the BJP youth wing's ‘March to Nabanna’. The Mamata Banerjee-led government said peaceful and democratic rallies within ""permissible parameters"" of only 100 people would be allowed.

The government also announced that Nabanna, the state secretariat building in Howrah, will be closed for a two-day sanitisation exercise.

Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress MP Kakoli G Dastidar hit out at the BJP saying, ""So much for BJP's 'peaceful rally' which was led by a BJP worker carrying a firearm and sharp weapons. People will not accept BJP's politics of hate and violence in Bengal. Absolutely disgusting.""

Justin David Rapier, 41, of Marion, was arrested on two counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee. Rapier allegedly sexually abused a high school girl in his Cedar Rapids home on two occasions while he was employed at Riverside High School in Oakland. The student, a juvenile, told police the abuse occurred on Aug. 10, 2019, and again in May 2021.

A preliminary hearing has been set for 8:30 a.m. April 15 in Linn County District Court. Bail was set at $8,000.

Rapier has pleaded not guilty to a charge of sexual exploitation by a school employee from when he worked at Highland School District, rural Riverside. The arrest report says Rapier, a language arts teacher, allegedly had sexual contact with a girl who attended the school and sent her messages by text and social media from 2017 to 2021. She was a juvenile at the time, the report said.

A pretrial conference is scheduled for June 6 in the Washington County Courthouse. Rapier is free on a $5,000 bond and a no-contact order has been issued.

Rapier’s attorney, Cory Goldensoph of Cedar Rapids has made a motion for discovery.

If convicted, Rapier could face up to five years in prison for each count.

Putin’s government.

Bloomberg News and the BBC said their correspondents in Russia could no longer freely report because of the new censorship law signed by Mr. Putin on Friday, which effectively criminalized independent journalism on the invasion of Ukraine. Under the legislation, which could take effect as early as Saturday, journalists who simply describe the war as a “war” could be sentenced to prison.

“The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country,” Bloomberg’s editor in chief, John Micklethwait, wrote in a note to staff.

CNN International, the global arm of CNN, said it had stopped airing in Russia, and ABC News said that it would not broadcast from the country on Friday. “We will continue to assess the situation and determine what this means for the safety of our teams on the ground,” ABC News, which is based in New York, said in a statement.",[],[''],"{'Mr. Putin', 'Vladimir V.

vessels legal, Malami insists

Malami

The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, has justified the approval he gave to Omoh Jay Nig Ltd, a firm accused of stealing Crude Oil and Diesel, to auction seized vessels.

The AGF, in a statement that was signed by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu, insisted that the firm had no pending criminal charge as at the time it was granted the contact through an open bid that held in 2019.

He said his attention was drawn to a “maliciously concocted publication in some media outfit”, alleging that the auction contract was given to a company that is purportedly standing trial in court for stealing crude oil and diesel.

Malami decried that the misleading reports were aimed at confusing the public and tarnishing his good image.

Narrating his side of the story, Malami stated that Omoh Jay Nig Ltd was granted the approval vide Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) letter DPR/DSM/ROM/OPS/COL 2/285 dated August 11, 2009, to evacuate the products onboard of MT AKUADA and MT HOPE.

He said: “That was four years before the coming of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government and long before Malami was appointed as the Attorney General of the Federation.

“EFCC filed a motion dated 8th June 2009 but filed on 11th June 2009 in Suit No. FHC/B/130C/08 held at Court 1, ikpoba hill, Benin City before Hon. Justice Chukwura Nnamani praying for the following orders:

“An ORDER vesting custody of the vessel with contents on the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN);

“An ORDER forfeiting the vessel MT AKUADA used in conveying bunkered 12, 000 metric tonnes of crude oil seized to FRN; and

“An ORDER forfeiting the bunkered 12, 000 to FRN.

“NOTE: The Motion was struck out on 23rd October 2009.

“Also note that Omoh Jay Nig. Ltd filed Suit No FHC/L/CS/652/2018 against EFCC and 4 ors on 11th September 2018 at Lagos Judicial Division before Hon. Justice M.S Hassan praying for an ORDER directing the EFCC to unfreeze its account at Zenith Bank as it unlawfully and illegally connived to freeze the account without a valid court order.

“The EFCC did not file a Counter Affidavit or any written agreement.

“On 13th May 2019, Hon. Justice M.S Hassan granted the prayer of Omoh Jay Nig Ltd.

“The OHAGF confirms that following the president directive to clear territorial waters and highways of obsolete and unauthorized vessels, barges, ships, boats, trucks vehicles amongst others, it obtained Final Forfeiture Orders dated 16th January 2018 and 15th April 2019 from the Federal High Court on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria in Suit N0 FHC/ABJ/CS/741/2017, FHC/ABJ/CS/742/2017 and FHC/ABJ/CS/237/2019.

“Based on the advice of the Office of the National Security Adviser which is predicated upon the risk being posed by the drifting vessel MT ANUKET containing crude oil at Elegushi Beach and based on the expertise and experience of Omoh Jay Nigeria Limited in the disposal of the content of AKUADA and MT HOPE when engaged by the Department of Petroleum Resources dated 11th August 2009.

“The OHAGF engaged their vide letter dated 9th September 2019 to conduct an Open Bid Sale for the following vessels:

“MT ASTERIS with Crude Oil; MV PSV DERBY with Automated Gas Oil (AGO); MV ZAHRA with Automated Gas Oil (AGO); MT PEACE; and MT ANUKET EMERALD.

“The only involvement of Omoh Jay Nigeria Limited as far as the documents before the OHAGF is the baseless freezing of Omoh Jay Nigeria Limited account as a fall out in the case lost by the EFCC on MT AKUADA and MT HOPE and even at that, the Federal High Court, Lagos Division has struck out motion brought against Omoh Jay Nigeria Limited as stated above.

""It is worthy to mention that the disposal of the vessels was done following the final forfeiture obtained by the OHAGF and the Presidential Directive of 25th October 2018 directing the OHAGF to put in the interim before the passage of the Proceeds of Crime Bill, appropriate transitional arrangements for the management and expeditious disposal of the realizable assets to preserve their economic value.

“Therefore, as far as the question of the criminality of Omoh Jay Nigeria Ltd is concerned, it is not before the OHAGF and for the avoidance of doubt, it should be noted that the disposal of the vessels under reference was conducted with the due process following a report submitted by",[],"['The', 'Attorney-General', 'the', 'Federation', 'and', 'Minister', 'Justice', '', 'Mr.', 'Abubakar', 'Malami', '', 'SAN', '', 'has', 'justified', 'the...The Advocate']",set(),[],,,,True,2.0,,"The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, has justified the approval he gave to Omoh Jay Nig Ltd, a firm accused of stealing Crude Oil and Diesel, to auction seized vessels.

Describing someone as a grandparent at work is age discrimination - even if they are one, an employment tribunal has ruled.

Executive Anne Dopson sued her employer after a colleague wrote a car review which described the then-62-year-old as 'a grandmother'.

The former sales director, who has three grandchildren, said she was upset when the glowing review of a Renault Kadjar said it had performed admirably as 'comfy wheels' for a grandparent.

Mrs Dopson, now 66, complained to her boss that, although she was a grandmother at the time, it had been 'a dig at my age' and had 'raised a laugh in the office', the panel heard.

Sales director Anne Dopson sued her employer for discrimination after a colleague wrote a car magazine review which described the then-62-year-old as 'a grandmother'

The grandmother-of-three later resigned from her £50,000-a-year job and then took her employers to a tribunal claiming discrimination.

An employment judge has now ruled the review was 'detrimental' and 'less favourable' treatment because it pointed out her age.

However, her claim ultimately failed as it was lodged too late and was deemed an 'isolated' incident.

The hearing was told Mrs Dopson began working for Stag Publications, a publishing, media and events company, in 2002 as an advertising manager before becoming the sales director.

Stag Publications - based in St Albans, Herts - has a target readership in the automotive trade and one of the publications it printed was Fleet World.

In the May 2017 issue of the magazine, Steve Moody, the publisher at the company, wrote a review of a Renault Kadjar seven seater car.

Mrs Dopson complained colleagues had had 'a dig at my age' and 'raised a laugh in the office' after she was described as 'a grandmother' in a car review article for a magazine produced by Stag Publications, the media company where she was a sales director. Pictured: Stag's office in St Albans

In that article, read to the hearing, he wrote: 'So the Kadjar has gone back after a year of service on our fleet.

'In that time myself, Luke Wikner, Nat Middleton, Alex Grant and Anne Dopson have all spent a fair amount of time behind the wheel, which basically means it has had three spells as family transport, one as a ride for the bachelor about town and the other as comfy wheels for a grandmother.

'You can choose who applies to which category. But the point is this: it has performed very well in all roles, being stylish on the outside and functionally superb on the inside.

'Very impressed indeed, as we all were with the Kadjar.'

Mrs Dopson then wrote an email to her Managing Director Jerry Ramsdale - later filed as a grievance - which mentioned the editorial, the tribunal heard.

Her email read: '[The reference to me being a grandmother] doesn't exactly sit well at the moment, and apparently raised a laugh in the office, however even though I made a joke of it with Steve in light of people being told that I am leaving/retiring this can only highlight my age to everyone.

'I have no problem with being a grandma and I love and have been called Grandma since 1990 by marriage, and for the last seven years since Tom was born I delight in taking every opportunity to show his pictures to all and sundry, but I don't agree with what could be perceived as a dig at my age.'

The formal grievance was investigated and rejected which Mrs Dopson later appealed, the tribunal heard.

The hearing were told Mrs Dopson - who has now moved to Ireland - started a sickness absence in May 2017 from which she never returned.

Luke Wikner, the head of production at the company, then investigated her appeal which was again rejected. Mrs Dopson however said the decision was 'flawed' as she felt he was 'not impartial', the panel were told.

As a result, she resigned in October 2017 and filed a claim for unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal and age discrimination to the employment tribunal.

Prior to this, Stag Publications experienced a loss of £80,000 in profits in the first four months of 2016 and a question of bonuses created 'conflict' between Mrs Dopson and Mr Ramsdale, the tribunal - held remotely in Watford - heard.

It concluded Mrs Dopson resigned because her income was going to be 'significantly reduced' due to a drop in revenue, the company's failure to make profits and the ambiguity surrounding when or whether it would return to profit.

election commission so they can then be scanned in Nashville, Tenn. Thursday, Aug. 6, 2020

A Tennessee law that blocks sharing absentee ballot application forms will remain in effect, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.

Tennessee voters must apply for a vote-by-mail or absentee ballot by completing and submitting an application to their local election commission, who will then handle the process of sending out ballots to those eligible voters.

Those applications are widely available. The Secretary of State's office and local county commissions often put them online for individual voters to download, print and mail.

But state law imposes a felony charge for anyone who shares those applications with another person if they're not an employee of an election commission.

Voting rights activists last summer sued the state in an attempt to overturn the law. They argue handing out the application is an effective part of get-out-the-vote campaigns to put the tools in people's hands more easily.

But the state says they're focused on minimizing election fraud and there are other, more secure ways to get the form.

U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson denied a motion for an injunction against the law in September, ahead of the presidential election last fall.

He reiterated most of the same arguments in Tuesday's ruling.

""The Court must decide for itself what the Law does and does not prohibit. And as the Court explained at considerable length in its Preliminary Injunction Opinion, the Law simply does not prohibit any conduct that is expressive,"" he wrote. ""Accordingly,

the Court concludes that the Law does not restrict expressive conduct and thus is not within the scope of the First Amendment.""

The plaintiffs include the Memphis and West Tennessee AFL-CIO Central Labor Council, the Tennessee State Conference of the NAACP, The Equity Alliance, and Memphis A. Phillip Randolph Institute and Free Hearts.

Most of them were also named plaintiffs in a separate federal lawsuit against the state's rules on first-time voters. That suit also failed to make major changes after initial injunctions; the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in June undid a lower court's decision.

""Of course, we agree with Judge Richardson’s order and his recognition of the General Assembly’s responsibility and authority in protecting the integrity of Tennessee’s elections. Additionally, we are grateful for the great work of the Attorney General’s office,"" Julia Bruck, spokesperson for the Tennessee Secretary of State's office wrote in an email Wednesday.

A request for comment sent to attorneys for the voting activists was not immediately returned.

The letters, signed by Secretary for Security John Lee, were sent to Lai after the Hong Kong authorities announced the freezing of his majority stake in publisher Next Digital (0282.HK) and local accounts of three companies owned by him under a sweeping new national security law.

One of Lai's financial advisers said that while the amount of funds in the accounts was relatively small, they represented the Hong Kong management end of a global network of banking relationships covering his private wealth.

Three senior private bankers and three corporate lawyers - independent from Lai's accounts - said the action extended the tightening national security apparatus into elite tiers of the banking system for the first time, exposing risks for clients and top financial managers in Hong Kong.

The advisers are seeking guidance from bankers and lawyers on how to challenge the freeze, and its impact on offshore holdings and banking relationships managed through Hong Kong until now.

The action by the security secretary is also fuelling concern about the broader investment climate in the city given the potential reach of the security law, imposed on the former British colony last June by China's parliament, lawyers, bankers and diplomats say.

The moves could imperil any attempt by the democracy activist to move offshore assets back home to prop up Next's troubled Apple Daily tabloid, a staunch government critic, the financial adviser said.

Shares in Next Digital rose as much as 330% as they resumed trading on Thursday after authorities last week froze Lai’s 71.26% stake, then worth $45 million.

Lai has emerged as one of the highest profile targets of the new law and is facing three national security charges including allegedly colluding with a foreign country.

The letter to Lai, sent to him at the city's high-security Stanley Prison, threatens up to seven years' jail and an unspecified fine for any dealing in the named assets, including disposal or conversion, using them as collateral or transferring them in or out of Hong Kong.

The letter to Lai lists seven Hong Kong accounts that are linked to three companies registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).

Lai could not be reached for comment.

Described as ""Notice No. 1"", the letter states that the action is taken under the ""implementation rules"" of Article 43 of the law, which allows for the seizure or freezing of property ""used or intended to be used"" for the commission of an offence.

The letters also acknowledge the right of Lai and the banks to challenge the notice, which expires in May 2023, in court.

The same language was used in letters to HSBC (HSBA.L) and Citibank (C.N), according to the documents seen by Reuters.

A Security Bureau spokesman said as judicial proceedings were going on ""it is not appropriate for us to disclose operational details"".

""Suffice to say, endangering national security is a very serious crime.""

Banking regulator, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said banks had to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations, including freezing of assets under relevant laws, which includes the national security law.

""The HKMA has no role in criminal investigations and we are not in a position to comment,"" it said.

'WAKE-UP CALL'

The letter to Lai specified that he would be held liable if he dealt with the assets ""except under the authority of a licence"" granted by Security Secretary Lee.

The letters to the two banks did not make clear which employees in the bank would be held liable.

A Hong Kong-based spokesperson for Citibank said the bank did not comment on individual client accounts. ""Citi is required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in markets where we operate,"" the spokesperson said. A spokeswoman at HSBC in Hong Kong declined to comment.

Case: Activist Disha Ravi was arrested last week from her Bengaluru home. (File)

A day after three news channels got notice over activist Disha Ravi's petition - linked to the coverage of her arrest in a case related to the farmers' protest toolkit shared by Swedish teen climate crusader Greta Thunberg earlier this month - the Delhi High Court today made observations about ""sensationalism"" in reporting.

The High Court asked Delhi Police to stick to the stand that it hasn't leaked details while the reporters were asked to ensure the ""probe is not hampered"". At the same time, Ms Ravi, 22, has been ""directed to ensure that there is no indulgence to malign the police and other authorities"".

In her petition, the activist had sought action against three news channels - News 18, India Today, and Times Now - for publishing contents of her alleged private chats, thereby violating Cable TV Network rules

""While a journalist cannot be asked to reveal their source, the same has to be authentic. The Delhi Police claims that it has not leaked anything whereas the media claims to the contrary,"" the court observed today.

""Half-baked, speculative information about an ongoing investigation was being disseminated,"" lawyer Akhil Sibal, appearing for the environmental activist, told the court even as the Delhi Police maintained that no private chats were leaked.

""Right to privacy, the sovereignty and integrity of the country and the freedom of speech need to be balanced. The recent coverage definitely shows there is sensationalised reporting by the media. While press briefings are held generally, media cannot disseminate the information in such a sensationalised manner,"" the High Court said.

The news channels have been told to ""ensure that proper editorial control is exercised while disseminating information to ensure investigation is not hampered"".

""Time would be needed to be given to all respondents to file detailed replies,"" the court said.

Ms Ravi had moved the High Court seeking directions to the police to not leak investigation material, including alleged contents of her private chats, to the media. The 22-year-old had also said the police ""did not obtain any transit remand, nor did they permit the petitioner to consult with a lawyer"".

""Surprisingly, there was significant media coverage of the petitioner's remand hearing and the media seemed to have more knowledge about the time and venue of the petitioner's production than her lawyers,"" her petition said.

Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Suryaprakash V Raju today said Ms Ravi was ""defaming and vilifying the police to put pressure"" on the cops, stressing that the petition ""is a systematic attempt to blame the police and derail investigation.""

""The police or any other agency cannot use the media till investigation is pending to subvert the process of justice, as this would weaken the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused,"" Mr Sibal countered.

Ms Ravi's arrest had triggered widespread condenmnation from the opposition leaders and farmers who have been agitating against three new agricultural laws near Delhi's borders since late November.

She and two other activists - Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk - held a Zoom meeting before the Republic Day to plan a social media buzz on the tractor rally, which descended into violence, police said earlier this week.

On Sunday, the police alleged that Disha Ravi was a key conspirator and in an attempt to revive a Khalistani group, prepared and spread the Toolkit. ""I did not make the Toolkit. We wanted to support the farmers. I edited two lines on February 3,"" Disha Ravi had told a Delhi court.

""Disha Ravi has been arrested after following all due processes. Whether someone is 22 or 50 years old, law treats everyone equally. The court was in agreement with the decision to arrest her... and, hence, we were given the remand for five days,"" Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava told reporters on Tuesday amid outrage.",[],"['Disha Ravi', 'Toolkit Case', 'Delhi High Court']","{'Disha Ravi', 'Swati Bhasin', 'Toolkit Case', 'Delhi High Court', 'Akshay Kumar Dongare'}",[],,,,True,2.0,,"A day after three news channels got notice over activist Disha Ravi's petition - linked to the coverage of her arrest and the case filed over the farmers' protest toolkit shared by teen climate crusader Greta Thunberg earlier this month - the Delhi High Court today made observations about ""sensationalism"" in reporting.",en,https://www.ndtv.com/static/images/logo_ndtv_touch_icon.png,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/toolkit-case-delhi-high-court-asks-police-to-stick-to-stand-that-it-hasnt-leaked-details-media-asked-to-ensure-probe-not-hampered-2373967,<Element div at 0x7f5f5920dd60>,<Element div at 0x7f5f5beeb9a0>,<Element html at 0x7f5f5bb64ae0>,<Element html at 0x7f5f5bb644a0>,{},1db1b1757235ad143d6df9a64fa960f9.1652112167.3827524,gdelt_events,09-05-2022,534fcd72-39c2-c656-faff-6903ede00e36,2021_01_01-2021_02_28_gdelt_data.csv

NEW YORK (AP) — The British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted Wednesday of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by the American millionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

The verdict capped a monthlong trial featuring sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14, told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein’s palatial homes in Florida, New York and New Mexico.

Jurors deliberated for five full days before finding Maxwell guilty of five of six counts. As the verdict was read, Maxwell appeared to show little reaction behind a black mask. She stood with her hands folded as the jury filed out, and glanced at her siblings as she herself was led from the courtroom, but was otherwise stoic.

She faces the likelihood of years in prison — an outcome long sought by women who spent years fighting in civil courts to hold Maxwell accountable for her role in recruiting and grooming Epstein’s teenage victims and sometimes joining in the sexual abuse.

The defense had insisted Maxwell was a victim of a vindictive prosecution devised to deliver justice to women deprived of their main villain when Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial in 2019.

During the trial, prosecutors called 24 witnesses to give jurors a picture of life inside Epstein’s homes — a subject of public fascination and speculation ever since his 2006 arrest in Florida in a child sex case.

A housekeeper testified he was expected to be “blind, deaf and dumb” about the private lives of Epstein, a financier who cultivated friendships with influential politicians and business tycoons, and Maxwell, who had led a jet-setting lifestyle as the favorite child of a media mogul.

Pilots took the witness stand and dropped the names of luminaries — Britain’s Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump — who flew on Epstein’s private jets.

Jurors saw physical evidence like a folding massage table once used by Epstein and a “black book” that listed contact information for some of the victims under the heading “massages.”

There were bank records showing he had transferred $30.7 million to Maxwell, his longtime companion — one-time girlfriend, later employee.

But the core of the prosecution was the testimony of four women who said they were victimized by Maxwell and Epstein at tender ages.

Three testified using first names or pseudonyms to protect their privacy: Jane, a television actress; Kate, a former model from Great Britain; and Carolyn, now a mom recovering from drug addiction. The fourth was Annie Farmer, a psychologist who chose to use her real name after being vocal about her allegations in recent years.

They echoed one another in their descriptions of Maxwell’s behavior: She used charm and gifts to gain their trust, taking an interest in their adolescent challenges and giving them assurances that Epstein could use his wealth and connections to fulfill their dreams.

They said the script would darken when Maxwell coaxed them into giving massages to Epstein that turned sexual, encounters she played off as normal: After one sexual massage, Kate, then 17, said Maxwell asked her if she’d had fun and told her: “You are such a good girl.”

Carolyn testified that she was one of several underprivileged teens who lived near Epstein’s Florida home in the early 2000s and took up an offer to give massages in exchange for $100 bills, which prosecutors described as “a pyramid of abuse.”

Maxwell made all the arrangements, Carolyn told the jury, even though she knew the girl was only 14 at the time.

Jane said in 1994, when she was only 14, she was instructed to follow Epstein into a pool house at his Palm Beach estate, where he masturbated on her.

The lone count on which Maxwell was acquitted, enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, applied only to Jane.

“I was frozen in fear,” she told the jury, adding that assault was the first time she had ever seen a penis. She also directly accused Maxwell of participating in her abuse.

Maxwell’s lawyer asked Jane why it had taken so long to come forward.

“I was scared,” she said, choking back tears. “I was embarrassed, ashamed. I didn’t want anybody to know any of this about me.”

night, and boarded a plane for their journey back to Israel.

Nigerian authorities released the trio from prison Tuesday evening and handed them over to US custody. American embassy staff then took them to the local Chabad center to spend the night.

They were given their passports and phones just before their flight took off for Istanbul Wednesday night.

The three Israelis will arrive at Ben Gurion Airport Thursday morning at 8:50 am.

Rudy Rochman, a pro-Israel activist with almost 95,000 followers on Instagram, filmmaker Andrew Noam Leibman and French-Israeli journalist Edouard David Benaym were arrested July 9 while shooting a documentary in a separatist region of southeast Nigeria.

The Israelis were in Nigeria to film “We Were Never Lost,” a documentary exploring Jewish communities in African countries such as Kenya, Madagascar, Uganda and Nigeria. They were focusing on the Igbo Jewish community in Nigeria.

In a statement published on Instagram Wednesday night, the trio said that they were “wrongfully taken on Friday July 9th, 2021 at 7:30 AM (Nigerian time) to the local DSS facility in Anambra State, Nigeria where they were held for 24 hours before being transported to the DSS headquarters in Abuja, 9 hours away with dangerous trasport [sic].”

The DSS, or Department of State Services, is Nigeria’s internal security agency.

The men said they were taken into custody at gunpoint by “over a dozen” DSS men wearing black ski masks.

“Rudy, Noam, and David were caged and held for 20 days in horrendous conditions, locked into a small cell, sleeping on the floor with no access to showers or clean clothes. They were interrogated and mistreated without ever officially being arrested or accused of anything.”

The three men said in their statement that they were officially cleared of all wrongdoing, but were instructed by the Nigerian government to leave the country immediately.

They promised to find another way to tell the story of Igbo Jewish life.

The filmmakers spent three Shabbats in prison, and were provided with Kosher food by the local Chabad and members of the Jewish community. They were denied legal representation during their incarceration, according to members of the Jewish community with knowledge of the situation.

According to media reports, Nigerian authorities from the Department of State Services arrested and interrogated the trio on suspicion that they had come in contact with Biafran separatists.

One of the men entered Nigeria on a French passport, and the other two on American passports. This made it difficult for the Israeli embassy to get involved at the onset, according to sources with knowledge of the situation.

The families of the three Israelis said Wednesday that local political elements had “twisted” the gifting of a Torah scroll to a local community to claim it constitutes support for separatist political ambitions.

The Torah scroll is currently with the local community.

The men took off from Ben Gurion Airport on July 5 and landed in Nigeria the next day.

According to locals, the crew was detained at a synagogue during services in the Igbo village of Ogidi. The Igbo consider themselves a lost tribe of Israel.

“The filmmaking crew thought it would be a nice gesture to bring several gifts with cultural symbolism to the communities it planned to visit,” the families said in their statement, adding that one of the gifts was the Torah scroll.

“Unfortunately, members of non-state political groups have hijacked for their own purposes images of the filmmakers gifting a Torah to a local community,” the families charged.

A relative of one of the men told The Times of Israel last week that separatist social media accounts had taken advantage of the Israelis’ trip to claim that the three were supporting Biafran separatist groups.

The PKK has been fighting for the freedom of the Kurdish people, an oppressed minority nationality in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. While the PKK has carried out an armed struggle since 1984, it has also implemented at least four unilateral ceasefires, the first in 1993 and the latest in 2013 when it began withdrawing its armed units to camps in Northern Iraq.

The PKK has dropped its demand for an independent Kurdish state and now calls for autonomy within a democratised Turkey.

The preamble to the petition states: “The PKK seeks to enter into direct negotiations with the Turkish government. Its acknowledged leader, Abdullah Öcalan, jailed in Turkey since 1999, will play a key role in any such negotiations and the PKK wants his harsh conditions of imprisonment significantly eased to facilitate this.”

The federal government first added the PKK to the list of prohibited organisations in 2006 after Turkey’s dictator President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited Australia. It was re-listed last August.

Being listed a “terrorist organisation” makes it illegal for Australians to be a member of the PKK, raise funds or actively support it. This is a serious restriction on Kurdish Australians’ freedom of political expression.

The Australian Federal Police and ASIO have raided the homes and community centres of the Kurdish community in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Kurdish-Australian journalist Renas Lelikan was arrested and charged with being a member of the PKK in 2016, after reporting on the Kurdish freedom struggle from the Middle East.

Lelikan was eventually convicted of being a member of the PKK, however, in her sentencing in 2019 NSW Supreme Court Justice Lucy McCallum recognised that “the ideology of the PKK as expressed in the writings of Abdullah Öcalan has more in common with the values of our democracy than it does with extremist violent jihad”.

The government’s listing of the PKK left the court no choice but to convict Lelikan, McCallum said “there was no available evidence that the PKK seeks to harm Australians or Australia’s democratic institutions. Nor is there evidence to suggest that Australia faces any threat from the PKK”.

“Whilst I accept that support for terrorism is inherently serious, the ideal of self-determination espoused by the PKK is not the most dangerous ideal of our times.”

The supreme court of Belgium ruled in 2020 that the PKK is not a terrorist organisation.

Two Labor MPs on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security issued a dissenting minority report, after the PKK’s terrorist listing — the first and only time the committee has been divided over whether an organisation should be listed.

Greens MPs and independent MP Andrew Wilkie support the calls for de-listing. NSW Greens MP Jamie Parker told Green Left: “The PKK poses no risk to the people of Australia. The listing denies the important role it can play in a peace process and its key role in the defeat of ISIS.

“The Australian Greens opposed the original listing of the PKK under the John Howard government in 2005. Delisting the PKK would give extra impetus to a peace process between the Kurds and Turkey. The leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, can play an important role in a peace process and should be released from his inhumane imprisonment.”

Melbourne-based activist and Co-Chair of North and East Syria Solidarity Fionn Skiotis told GL that the new petition was part of an international campaign. The Belgian Supreme Court decision was “one of the first cracks in the crumbling of this ridiculous labeling of the PKK as a terrorist organisation, which it is not”, he said.

Labelling the PKK a terrorist organisation helps the Turkish state continue to oppress the Kurdish people. “In Turkey, people can be sent to jail for simply saying a Kurdish expression, or singing a Kurdish song because this can be presented as some form of support for ‘terrorism’”, Skiotis said.

On the day Jimmy Lai, its founder, was sentenced to 14 months in prison in April, a commentary in the pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao called for a ban on Apple Daily in order to “close national security loopholes”.

The 72-year-old media tycoon and his 26-year-old newspaper have been among the most high-profile critics of Beijing and the controversial national security law (NSL), which they deem “draconian”, but which the authorities say is “necessary”. The law bars secession, subversion and foreign collusion.

Shortly after the news of the paper’s closure made headlines on Wednesday, campaign groups criticised the move. Amnesty International said in a statement that it was “the blackest day for media freedom in Hong Kong’s recent history”. “The fact that the authorities are using the national security law to enable this crackdown highlights the deeply repressive nature of the legislation,” it wrote.

But while critics argue recent moves endanger press freedom, the authorities appear to have their own framing of the saga. On Tuesday, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, told critics not to “beautify these acts of endangering national security”. Lam’s security chief, John Lee, last week urged the public and the media to cut all ties with several of the newspaper’s executives who had been arrested, “or you’ll regret it very much”.

‘Rotten apple’

In Beijing, China’s state broadcaster remarked last month that “doomsday is getting closer and closer” for the “rotten apple that plagued Hong Kong for 20 years”. The Global Times this week quoted Louis Chen, the general secretary of Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, as saying: “What Apple Daily has done is crystal clear: the paper takes the national security law as nothing by continuing violating the law and it has gone far beyond ethical and journalistic standards.”

To some mainland Chinese, Apple Daily is a symbol of a split in Chinese identity and the newspaper itself has been viewed as controversial over the years. In 2012, for example, it published a full-page advertisement calling mainland Chinese “locusts” who swarmed Hong Kong to drain its resources. On the social media platform Weibo, a related hashtag created when the paper’s editor was arrested has been viewed 110m times.

Yet, all of this is happening as businesses and news media are recalibrating their strategies in Hong Kong amid the change in political atmosphere. Therefore, the chilling effect among media and individuals is also palpable.

“When people as outspoken as me are unwilling to speak on air about this subject, then you can reasonably infer that they no longer feel safe to speak under the NSL,” David Webb, a prominent Hong Kong investor who held shares in Next Digital – Apple Daily’s parent company – told the media.

For many years, the culture of free speech in Hong Kong attracted the likes of the New York Times and the Financial Times to expand their operations in the former British colony. But in the last few years, as both local and foreign journalists’ associations complain about “deterioration of press freedom”, news media have been rethinking their Hong Kong strategies, too.

The New York Times, for example, last year announced its intention to move some of its Hong Kong staff to Seoul because the NSL “unsettled news organisations and created uncertainty about the city’s prospects as a hub for journalism”. Several other international news outlets are said to be planning a similar move.

International press may have the luxury to choose where to be based, but local organisations are likely to end up with limited options. It is difficult to predict what is next in this fluid situation, but analysts are taking the authorities’ use of the Trump-era phrase “fake news” in recent weeks as an indication.

Last month, Lam said her government was working on “fake news” legislation to tackle “misinformation, hatred and lies”. “We will continue to be very serious about this issue because of the damage it is doing to many people,” she said.

Shortly after that remark, the police sent a glossy pamphlet called “Know the facts: rumours and lies can never be right” to a few Hong Kong-based newsrooms, including the New York Times. Accompanying it was a letter addressed to editors, warning against the “wicked and ",[],[''],set(),['Vincent Ni'],2021-06-23 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,"Analysis: a palpable chill has run through the Hong Kong media, amid warnings about ‘fake news’",en,https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/23/the-blackest-day-apple-dailys-demise-comes-as-no-surprise,<Element div at 0x7f1b9bbf21d0>,<Element div at 0x7f1b9bbd7180>,<Element html at 0x7f1b9bc36bd0>,<Element html at 0x7f1b9bc36220>,{},31d2ea30b8070be7b8af3e1b3c2299a0.1652033883.3785586,gdelt_events,08-05-2022,656f262d-02ce-c1bf-0a82-2710bd0a8b7b,2021_05_01-2021_06_30_gdelt_data.csv

Police sources said that a 44-year-old man of Uruguayan nationality, reportedly an anarchist, had been taken into custody following a raid on a flat at Lavalle 3766 in the early hours of Friday morning.

Officers at the scene reportedly found two metal drums containing petrol. They identified the individual using CCTV footage of the incident at the newspaper’s offices in the City neighbourhood of Barracas.

Leaders from across the political spectrum this week condemned Monday night’s attack on the newspaper’s offices, which Grupo Clarín bosses described as “worrying” but “minor.” At least nine molotov cocktails were thrown at the entrance to the pro-opposition daily’s offices on Monday night at around 11.05pm.

The attack was captured by a nearby security camera. In the footage, which Clarín posted on its website, a group of hooded people can be seen loitering on the pavement on the opposite side of the road to the building, located at 1743 Piedras.

The gang, thought to number nine, then start to throw crude incendiary devices, commonly known as molotov cocktails, at the newspaper’s offices, before running off down Ituzaingó Street.

Security staff promptly called the emergency services, with firefighters and police rushing to the scene and sealing off a perimeter. The City’s Bomb Squad was also deployed to ensure all the incendiary devices were no longer a threat.

The incident has been classified as “public intimation” by the authorities, who have opened an investigation and are searching for the culprits. On Tuesday morning, scorch marks could be seen on the pavement and building’s exterior.

Condemnation of the attack was swift and came from all political sectors.

""I would like to express our repudiation of the episode that took place in front of the Clarín newspaper’s headquarters. Violence always disrupts democratic coexistence. We hope that the facts are clarified and the perpetrators are identified through the investigation that is underway,"" President Alberto Fernández said in a post on Twitter.

""Democratic coexistence, which is severely affected by the promotion of hate speech, must be cared for by all Argentines,"" read a statement issued via the La Cámpora youth organisation linked to Kirchnerite sector of the ruling coalition that has often been at odds with the newspaper.

Taking a stronger tone, former president Mauricio Macri said the “unacceptable” attack was an assault on freedom of speech.

""The attack on Clarín is a very serious attempt to intimidate the media and the entire press. It is unacceptable and reminiscent of the violent practices of the past. I repudiate the attack and send my solidarity. May the government and the justice system clarify what happened and arrest those responsible,"" said the Juntos por el Cambio leader on Twitter.

Buenos Aires City Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta also repudiated the attack, describing it as a ""sign of intolerance and violence.""

A number of press organisations, including Asociación de Entidades Periodísticas Argentinas (ADEPA), Foro de Periodismo Argentino (FOPEA), Federación Internacional de Periodistas (FIP) and Sindicato de Prensa de Buenos Aires (SiPreBA) also expressed their condemnation of the attack, calling on the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.

In a statement, the newspaper’s parent company Grupo Clarín condemned the “violent expression of intolerance against a media outlet” and said it was awaiting “urgent clarification and sanction.”

Fenster formerly worked for the Daily Iberian and the Current. He moved to Myanmar in June 2020 to continue his work as a journalist. In May 2021, Myanmar officials detained Finster on charges of spreading false or inflammatory information, contacting illegal organizations, and violating visa regulations.

US journalist jailed in Myanmar for nearly 6 months is freed



By GRANT PECK and DAVID RISING

BANGKOK (AP) — American journalist Danny Fenster, who was recently sentenced to 11 years of hard labor after spending nearly six months in jail in military-ruled Myanmar, was freed and on his way home Monday, a former U.S. diplomat who helped negotiate the release said.

Fenster, the managing editor of the online magazine Frontier Myanmar, was convicted Friday of spreading false or inflammatory information, contacting illegal organizations and violating visa regulations. His sentence was the harshest yet among the seven journalists known to have been convicted since the military ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in February.

“This is the day that you hope will come when you do this work,” Bill Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico and past ambassador to the U.N., said in a statement emailed by his office. “We are so grateful that Danny will finally be able to reconnect with his loved ones, who have been advocating for him all this time, against immense odds.”

Fenster was handed over to Richardson in Myanmar and will return to the U.S. via Qatar over the next day and a half, according to the statement. He has been in detention since he was taken into custody at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was headed to the Detroit area in the United States to see his family.

“We are overjoyed that Danny has been released and is on his way home — we cannot wait to hold him in our arms,” his family said in a statement. “We are tremendously grateful to all the people who have helped secure his release, especially Ambassador Richardson, as well as our friends and the public who have expressed their support and stood by our sides as we endured these long and difficult months.”

It was never exactly clear what Fenster was alleged to have done, but much the prosecution’s case appeared to hinge on proving that he was employed by another online news site that was ordered closed this year during a crackdown on the media following the military’s seizure of power. Fenster used to work for the site but left that job last year.

According to the United Nations, at least 126 journalists, media officials or publishers have been detained by the military since the takeover and 47 remain in custody, though not all of them have been charged.

Of the seven journalists known to have been convicted, six are Myanmar nationals and four were released in a mass amnesty on Oct. 21.

“We welcome the release of American journalist Daniel Fenster from prison in Burma, where he was wrongfully detained for almost six months,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, using an old name for the Southeast Asian country. “We are glad that Danny will soon be reunited with his family as we continue to call for the release of others who remain unjustly imprisoned in Burma.”

Frontier Myanmar Editor-in-Chief Thomas Kean echoed those sentiments.

“Danny is one of many journalists in Myanmar who have been unjustly arrested simply for doing their job since the February coup,” he said.

Richardson said he discussed Fenster’s release during a recent visit to Myanmar when he held face-to-face negotiations with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the country’s ruler.

A CNN crew reporting on the unrest in Minneapolis was arrested by state police officers while on live television, despite identifying themselves as reporters. The city was plunged into turmoil for a third night of protests in response to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed while in police custody.

The crew was released later Friday morning. Footage from CNN morning program ""New Day"" shows CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez reporting early in the morning, and then being approached by Minneapolis State Patrol.

A cameraperson who was arrested alongside Jimenez and his producer told CNN that police said they were being arrested for not moving to a new location after being directed to do so. However, footage shows that Jimenez and the crew informed the officers that they were reporters, and attempting to get out of the way.

""We can move back to where you'd like here. We are live on the air at the moment,"" Jimenez is heard saying to police officers approaching him in riot gear. ""Wherever you'd want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection.""

Two police officers are shown grabbing Jimenez's arms and informing him that he is under arrest.

""Okay. Do you mind telling me why I am under arrest, sir?"" Jimenez asks as the officers pull his arms behind his back to handcuff him. Another member of the CNN crew is heard informing the officers that they are live on television.

Jimenez's producer, Bill Kirkos, and the cameraperson, Leonel Mendez, were then arrested.

Story continues

CNN reporter Josh Campbell, who was also on the ground in Minneapolis in a different part of the city, told ""New Day"" anchors John Berman and Alisyn Camerota that he had the ""opposite"" experience of Jimenez.

""I identified myself, I told them who I was with, they said, 'okay, you're permitted to be in this area,'"" Campbell said. He expressed shock that the police arrested Jimenez and his crew after they identified themselves and informed the officers that they were reporting live. Campbell is white, and Jimenez is black.

CNN later reported that CNN president Jeff Zucker spoke to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who said he ""deeply apologizes"" for the arrest of Jimenez and his crew.

Jimenez, who was released later in the morning, reported that there was ""no animosity"" from the officers and said they told him they were following orders. Jimenez also said that while it was a shocking experience, he was comforted that it occurred on live TV.

""The one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV,"" Jimenez said, explaining that this allowed others to speak out on his behalf.

Minnesota State Patrol confirmed the arrests in a tweet.

""In the course of clearing the streets and restoring order at Lake Street and Snelling Avenue, four people were arrested by State Patrol troopers, including three members of a CNN crew. The three were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media,"" the tweet said. Jimenez and his crew had identified themselves as media while being arrested.

The arrest of Jimenez and the CNN crew comes after President Trump waded into the controversy to condemn the protesters and seemingly advocate for violence. Mr. Trump called the protesters ""thugs"" and said that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet was quickly flagged by Twitter as one that could glorify violence.

Niquel Johnson, 40, told the Washington Post that when he ordered his drinks last week he gave his Islamic name, Aziz, as he had done in the same store “countless” times before. This time, the three drinks he ordered all came back labelled “Isis”.

As well as being an Egyptian god, an alternative name for the river Thames and a song by Bob Dylan, Isis is the common acronym for the Islamic State terrorist group. Johnson said seeing the word on his beverages made him “shocked and angry”.

“I felt it was discrimination,” he said.

In a statement to the Post, Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said: “After investigating, we don’t believe this was a case of discrimination or profiling.

“The customer approached and provided the name Aziz. The barista mistakenly spelled it incorrectly. We have connected with Mr Johnson and apologized for this regrettable mistake.”

But Borges’ simple statement belied a baffling, labyrinthine story.

Johnson told the Post Starbucks claimed to have answered a complaint he filed by email via a phone conversation with his niece, Alora.

But Johnson insisted such a phone call could not have occurred. He does not have a niece named Alora and the nieces he does have are too young to have such a conversation.

Johnson provided to the Post a recording of an exchange with a Starbucks representative in which he made clear his confusion and anger.

“So that is a new revelation for me and us, Niquel,” the Post quoted the representative as saying. “And I don’t know how we got to that point. I apologize.”

The Post said the identity of the woman Starbucks says it spoke to remains a mystery.

This is not the first time a Starbucks store in Philadelphia has attracted national media attention, stoking intense debate about race and racism through the interaction between an employee and customers.

Last year, two African American men were arrested after a Starbucks worker in the city called police because the men were sitting peaceably but not ordering anything. The men eventually settled for $1 each and a promise from the company that it would set up a $200,000 programme for young entrepreneurs.

Starbucks’ chief executive, Kevin Johnson, apologised and ordered more than 8,000 stores closed for an afternoon, so that nearly 175,000 employees could be trained about the dangers of unconscious bias.

Johnson told the Post that the outcome of that case made him think Starbucks would treat his complaint seriously.

“You think they would have their facts in order,” he said. “How could they allow anyone to speak for me?”",[],[''],set(),['Martin Pengelly'],2019-09-01 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,"Niquel Johnson said when he ordered at a Philadelphia store he gave his Islamic name, Aziz",en,https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/01/niquel-johnson-starbucks-philadelphia-legal-action,<Element div at 0x7ef7593d3c70>,<Element div at 0x7ef7593c8d10>,<Element html at 0x7ef75a386b30>,<Element html at 0x7ef75a3866d0>,{},a801d8f739b58c8c559826b1ab1f8384.1652447234.4124281,gdelt_events,13-05-2022,65c58c11-b9c9-5afb-f634-ae1116206ee0,2019_09_01-2019_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

PETERSBURG, Russia -- A court in Russia's second-largest city, St. Petersburg, has upheld a lower court decision to fine a journalist whose collarbone was broken by a police officer while being taken into custody in July.



David Frenkel said on Twitter that the St. Petersburg City Court announced its decision on September 10.



In late July, the Dzerzhinskiy district court in St. Petersburg fined Frenkel, a Mediazona news-website correspondent, 2,500 rubles ($33) after finding him guilty of refusing to follow a police officer's instruction, meddling in the work of a polling station, and the violation of coronavirus restrictions on June 30.



Police said that, during his detainment, in which an officer broke Frenkel's collarbone, the journalist ""provoked a conflict situation"" by resisting law enforcement officers, pushing them, using his feet and leaning against walls even though video presented at the hearing failed to show such a scene.



Frenkel had gone to the polling station to check on possible violations during a national vote on controversial amendments that among other things allowed President Vladimir Putin the possibility of seeking new terms in office after his current one expires in 2024.



Video of the incident posted on social media shows two police officers tackling Frenkel to the ground. A cracking noise can be heard, followed by Frenkel screaming out in pain.

He underwent surgery due to his injury on June 30.



Denis Dmitriyev, the police officer who detained Frenkel, said at the hearing that he detained the journalist at the request of the election commission's chairman because Frenkel ""was interfering with the voting process,"" an accusation Frenkel denies.



Frenkel has filed a lawsuit against the police officer, accusing him of abuse of power, but the city's Investigative Committee refused to launch a probe.



A former city official, Dmitry Abramov, who said he was an observer at the polling station, testified at the hearing that Frenkel ""most likely"" broke his collarbone when he fell down on the floor and the injury was not inflicted by police.



During the incident, Abramov stepped on Frenkel's leg and pulled the arm affected by the broken collarbone, trying ""to prove"" that the journalist was faking an injury.



However, the St. Petersburg Public Chamber said Abramov was not an accredited observer, Mediazona has reported, raising questions about why he was there.

Leading scientists are warning that a failure to impose tougher restrictions will see tens of thousands of deaths.

Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine are predicting that a failure to act could lead to a further 25,000 to 75,000 deaths in the next five months.

Their worst case scenario is that there could be up to 492,000 hospital admissions and 24,700 deaths by the end of April.

On Tuesday, PM Johnson is to put his plan B to a House of Commons vote, and will be relying on Labour to vote for his plan and see it through.

To date, 65 Tory MPs who think that business has already been over-interfered with, are going to vote against the government, so PM Johnson will be relying on the Starmer-led Labour Party to see him through, and defeat the Tory ultras.

Two days later on Thursday, there is the North Shropshire by-election.

A large number of Tory MPs are now hoping that the Lib Dems will defeat their own Tory Party candidate, after which they will be sending a letter to the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, for a no confidence vote in PM Johnson to force his resignation and a new Tory leadership election.

Labour’s attitude to Johnson was made clear on Friday when Starmer was asked by the BBC: ‘Respectfully the question is: “Do you personally think that he should resign?” Starmer replied: ‘Look, I don’t think that he is fit for office, do I think that Boris Johnson will resign?

‘No I don’t think so, because I don’t think that he is fit for office, therefore I think his party has to ask some questions here. But look, we have got lie after lie, dishonesty after dishonesty, we have got a Prime Minister who says there wasn’t a party, now he is investigating a party he said didn’t exist.

‘We have got the Cabinet Secretary investigating whether a party happened in the Prime Minister’s own building.

‘He could end that investigation now by admitting that it happened and get the Cabinet Secretary back to doing the work of the government.’

Starmer says: ‘Johnson is not fit for office,’ but refuses to lead a national campaign to get him out.

In fact, he would rather allow the Tories to change horses in mid-stream, to continue the current effort to resolve the crisis at the expense of working people.

It has been clear from the start of the Covid-19 crisis that the Tories were much more interested in keeping business profitable than defending the NHS or the interests of the working class.

Starmer would rather that Johnson be replaced by someone like Truss, who he would join in a National Government to make the working class pay for the crisis rather than take action to bring the Tories down. He is helping the Tories by refusing to mobilise the working class to get rid of Johnson and the Tory government.

However, as the scientists are telling us, hundreds of thousands of lives are now in the balance. All the bosses and Starmer are concerned with is the capitalist system making billions in profits for the bankers and the monopolists.

The trade unions must now step forward to wage the struggle that former State Prosecutor Starmer refuses to wage.

The trade unions, with their millions of members must move forward to prosecute the struggle. They must tell Johnson that they will not allow up to 100,000 more deaths to keep capitalism going.

There must be an emergency recall of the TUC Congress to call a general strike to bring down the Tories and bring in a workers’ government. This will nationalise the banks and the major industries, to create the conditions for stamping out Covid-19 as they have done in China, and then go forward to socialism.",[],[''],"{'tuc', 'parliament', 'strike', 'labour party', 'china', 'broadcasting', 'banks', 'hospital', 'education', 'tory party', 'unions', 'election', 'nhs'}",[],2021-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png,https://wrp.org.uk/editorials/labour-tory-crisis-deepens-as-covid-19-omicron-variant-races-ahead-infecting-tens-of-thousands/,<Element div at 0x7f4b548a5ea0>,<Element div at 0x7f4b548a5d60>,<Element html at 0x7f4b548a29a0>,<Element html at 0x7f4b548a2090>,{},8da4bb53feec98e240cc34d496600e84.1651851606.6110518,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,e4aaa32e-bbdf-2c99-ed6d-03f342139738,2021_11_01-2021_12_31_gdelt_data.csv

cannons to disperse the workers of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) who were protesting near Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's farmhouse near here against the statewide power outages.

Led by Punjab AAP chief Bhagwant Mann, thousands of party workers gathered and started marching towards the farmhouse in Siswan, raising slogans.

Facing severe electricity crisis, the Punjab government curtailed timings of government offices from Friday, besides cutting down on power supply to high energy consuming industries with immediate effect to save crops and ease the domestic power situation.

AAP MLA and Youth Wing state president Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the main cause for the high cost and shortage of power is the wrong power purchase agreements reached by the previous (Parkash Singh) Badal government with the private thermal plants, which were not cancelled by the present Congress government.

""Just like the Badals, the Amarinder Singh government is also taking bribes from the power companies,"" he alleged.

The protest came days after AAP's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal promised free electricity up to 300 units and round-the-clock power supply in Punjab if the party wins the Assembly elections slated early next year.

A day earlier, the Shiromani Akali Dal had held statewide protests before the offices of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to highlight the plight of the farmers, domestic consumers and industrialists, claiming that they are suffering because the Congress government has ""deliberately"" withheld the eight-hour free power supply to the farmers, besides imposing unscheduled power cuts in the urban areas.

Mocking his own government in the state over the power outages, Congress leader and former Cabinet minister Navjot Sidhu had said on Friday, ""There is no need for power cuts in Punjab or for the Chief Minister to regulate office timings or AC use of the common people... If we act in the right direction."" Sidhu, in a series of back-to-back tweets, said, ""Punjab already gives Rs 9,000 crore power subsidy but Delhi gives only Rs 1,699 crore as power subsidy.

""If Punjab copies the Delhi model, we will get merely Rs 1,600-2,000 crore as subsidy. To better serve the people of Punjab -- Punjab needs an original Punjab model, not a copied Model!!""

has called Black Lives Matter protesters 'spoiled brats' and 'knuckleheads' for 'wasting police resources' after 14 were arrested during last night's demonstrations over the cop killing of a black city worker in Texas.

Commissioner Dermot Shea laid into protesters in an interview with NY1 Tuesday morning where he accused them of 'breaking windows, property damage, graffiti, lighting fires.'

Protesters took to the streets of the Big Apple Monday night after white cop Shaun David Lucas gunned down black man Jonathan Price while he was trying to break up a domestic violence situation at a gas station in Wolfe City Saturday night.

Price's death tops off a string of police killings of black men and women across America in recent months which have sparked nationwide protests demanding an end to police brutality and racism.

NYPD Commissioner Shea (pictured) has called Black Lives Matter protesters 'spoiled brats' and 'knuckleheads' for 'wasting police resources' after 14 were arrested during last night's demonstrations over the cop killing of a black city worker in Texas

Shea blasted protesters Tuesday morning as he said the NYPD had arrested 24 in connection to demonstrations across the city Monday night.

'Breaking windows, property damage, graffiti, lighting fires. I mean, that is the last thing that we as New Yorkers need right now,' he raged to NY1.

'And that's last night in New York City - 24 more arrests, you know, at a time when we have diminished resources, and we have a violent uptick with the courts and everything else going on.

'We don't need officers pulled away for these, sometimes I don't know what you call them - peaceful protesters - maybe spoiled brats at this point.'

DailyMail.com was told by the NYPD that the department actually made 14 arrests and issued 10 summonses during Monday night's protests.

Charges for those arrested included unlawful assembly, disorderly conduct, obstructing governmental administration, and one for petty larceny.

Ten summonses were also issued for disorderly conduct.

Footage on social media showed cops and protesters clashing, with one video showing officers lunge to detain a peaceful demonstrator.

Protests - that began back in May after the death of George Floyd - ramped up again Sunday and Monday after Price, a 31-year-old unarmed city worker, was shot dead by Wolfe City police officer Lucas, 22, on Saturday night.

Witnesses said Price was trying to break up a fight between a couple outside an East Texas convenience store.

Cops arrived on the scene and Lucas tasered and shot Price dead in the street.

Lucas was arrested and charged with murder Monday.

Shea's attack on protesters demonstrating in the wake of Price's killing and complaint of a lack of resources comes as he has repeatedly slammed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for axing $1 billion from the NYPD's budget back in June.

This included a cut of $335 million, from $603 million to $268 million, to the NYPD's overtime budget.

The NYPD is already on track to blow that overtime budget out, having spent $85.6 million in overtime already over the first three months of the fiscal year, according to the Independent Budget Office.

The data shows the department spent $13.8 million in July, $43.7 million in August, and $28 million in September.

However the NYPD historically spends over budget on overtime, averaging $723 million in recent years and last year spending $823 million - more than $200 million more than its $603 million budget.

The budget cuts came after shocking footage circulated on social media of NYPD cops violently attacking protesters as demonstrations erupted back in May.

Thousands have taken to the streets nationwide demanding justice and calling for an end to police brutality and racism since Memorial Day when black man George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis cop who knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes until he passed out and died.

Abdikarim Abdalla Ahmed was stabbed on Market Street in Bury, Lancashire, shortly before 4pm on Friday.

Emergency services treated him at the scene before he was taken to hospital, where he died.

A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with murder.

The boy has been remanded into custody and will appear before Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court on Monday.

Two other 16-year-old boys have been released on bail.

She added: “My beautiful boy Abdi passed away far too young and with his whole life ahead of him, he was taken from us too soon, and in the worst possible way.

“My boy was a victim of knife crime, I beg all parents to speak to their children and know what’s going on in their lives, before their child is taken away.”

“We can tell you that there is no scarcity of oil in this country,” Pathirana told reporters. “Do not get unnecessary fears.”

His comments came amid reports that Sri Lanka was seeking to borrow 2.5 billion US dollars from some unsolicited proposal made by US and Europe based funds to repay loans of state-run petroleum utility Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

But the cabinet spokesman said the country has “adequate stocks” and would finance oil purchases in the future.

“The government is ready to finance oil imports in the future,” he said.

Sporadic speculation over fuel availability came after Energy Minister Udaya Gammanpila asked the public to use fuel sparingly amid foreign exchange shortages.

Last month a trade union leader linked to the opposition was taken to custody by police for questioning over a statement that there is oil stock only for three weeks.

In July there were media reports that an oil tanker was kept waiting to discharge its cargo over a payment delay.

Meanwhile Minister Pathirana said the discussions between Minister Udaya Gammanpila and oil supplying countries are to discuss the price and long term credit lines.

“There is no final decision on this,” he said. “But I want to clearly say there is no oil scarcity.”

Sri Lanka raised oil prices earlier this year backtracking on an election promise to ‘fix’ oil prices through an energy price stabilization fund.

Government statements have said the banking system was threatened by over 652 billion rupees (about $3 billon US dollars) loaned rupees to the CPC, and prices had to be raised to stop further borrowings.

The public had questioned why the CPC is in debt when customers paid hard cash for oil.

Analysts had shown that whenever Sri Lanka’s central bank printed money to created foreign exchange shortages the CPC had been made to borrow dollars to avoid buying dollars in the market with the rupees, running up massive debts.

In 2018 the CPC ran an 80 billion rupee loss on its forex liabilities. Oil bills generally get the attention of policy makers (whenever money is printed) because they are large.

However in years when money is not printed and the central bank runs deflationary policy, the CPC not only pays oil bills effortlessly with its rupee revenues, but also repays part of its credit lines.

For at least two hours, politicians will be able to share their memories of the Conservative MP for Southend West after a morning of prayers and a minute’s silence at 2.30pm.

The Speaker of the House Sir Lindsay Hoyle will make a statement before Boris Johnson moves a motion for an adjournment, which will enable parliamentarians to open the tributes session, lasting until 5.30pm.

On Sunday evening, his family described how their “hearts are shattered” after he was attacked while meeting constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex on Friday.

In a statement published through the Metropolitan Police, his wife, four daughters and son said: “Strong and courageous is an appropriate way to describe David. He was a patriot and a man of peace.

“So, we ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. This is the only way forward. Set aside hatred and work towards togetherness.

“Whatever one’s race, religious or political beliefs, be tolerant and try to understand.

“As a family, we are trying to understand why this awful thing has occurred. Nobody should die in that way. Nobody.”

A 25-year-old man, understood by the PA news agency to be Ali Harbi Ali, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of Sir David’s murder and remains in police custody.

He has been detained under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and detectives are expected to continue to question him until Friday after a warrant of further detention was granted.

The Sunday Times said the suspected killer’s father, Harbi Ali Kullane, who the newspaper described as a former adviser to the prime minister of Somalia, had confirmed his British-born son had been arrested.

A friend of Mr Kullane’s, Harbi Farah, told the Sun: “I have known his dad Harbi for more than ten years. He’s a good man and this will be very upsetting for him.

“He’s a well-respected member of the Somali community in Britain and also in Somalia.

“He hasn’t been well for the last couple of years. He’s had surgery and is shielding.

“I never met Ali but I heard from other family members he was studying medicine.”

As part of the counter-terrorism investigation, Sir David’s links to the Gulf state of Qatar are being examined by police as part of a drive to analyse all avenues over why he was targeted, according to the Times newspaper.

The paper reported that it is one of several lines of inquiry being investigated, quoting Whitehall sources as saying a “clear reason on why he was targeted has not been established.”

Sir David was chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary British-Qatar Group, with his most recent visit to the nation being last week, according to images published on the group’s Twitter page.

The MP referenced the visit in one of his last tweets, writing: “As Chairman of @QatarAPPG, I was very pleased to meet the Emir during our recent delegation to Doha.”

The State of Qatar published a statement on Sunday condemning the attack, stating it considered his stabbing “a horrific crime and a clear violation of human rights.”

Other reports meanwhile suggested the attack was random.

The Telegraph said the politician was not “specifically targeted” but is believed to have been chosen as part of a plot to murder “any MP.”

Bong Go online but assured the public that the justice system in the country works.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after the Philippine National Police arrested last Wednesday a 41-year-old salesman in Butuan City for calling Duterte on Facebook “crazy” and that Go will supposedly come in to save the day.

In an interview over State-run PTV-4, Roque said while it was up to authorities to go after who they think are violating the law, other government agencies will eventually step up to correct their wrong judgment.

“We leave it to authorities pero kapag meron pang maling ginawa ang otoridad ay kino-correct naman po ng ibang ahensiya ng gobyerno gaya ng piskalya. So we will let the process proceed,” he said.

“Gaya ng nabalitaan ko ‘yung isa yata na naaresto eh nagkaroon ng order ang piskalya to release dahil hindi daw tama ‘yung warrantless arrest. So sa amin po, nagpapakita po ‘yan na gumagana naman ang ating sistema,” he added.

Roque was referring to the arrest of a public school teacher by the National Bureau of Investigation for a social media post offering a P50-million reward to anyone who would kill Duterte.

The Department of Justice said the warrantless arrest would have been invalid but was eventually “cured” after the teacher admitted to his actions.

Meanwhile, Roque said he will ask Philippine National Police chief Police Gen. Archie Gamboa to look into reports that a factory worker who violated quarantine protocols was “beaten black and blue” by police officers in General Trias, Cavite on May 12.

Bilal Farooqi, the news editor at the Express Tribune, said he was arrested by the Karachi police last week on charges of sedition for defaming the country’s army and criticizing the government but later he was released on bail. Absar Alam, a former anchor at AAJ news channel, said he also faced similar accusations in charges made available to him by police. Asad Ali Toor, a journalist at Samaa television, is facing a sedition case, the local media reported.

Many prominent journalists in Pakistan have taken to social media to describe their battles with government censorship. Reporters Without Borders has lowered Pakistan’s ranking by three points to 145 out of about 180 in its 2020 World Press Index. The ranking has dropped six notches since Khan, once a vocal advocate of the free media, came to power in 2018. The prime minister has claimed the press enjoys unprecedented freedom in the South Asian nation.

“The arrest of Bilal was a part of the nefarious and concerted plan to gag the free media and independent voices,” the Karachi Union of Journalists, said in a statement. The government has no tolerance for dissenting views and criticism of any kind, Farooqi said on phone from Karachi on Tuesday. Such cases are an “honor in a fascist regime,” Alam said on phone.

Zafar Abbas, a spokesman for Pakistan’s interior ministry, was not immediately available for comments on journalists being booked for treason.

In July, a senior journalist, Matiullah Jan, claimed he was kidnapped from Islamabad by the security forces and later released after pressure from the media groups. Jan is known for being a strong critic of Khan and the army’s alleged involvement in politics. The country’s powerful military has ruled Pakistan for about half of its seven-decade history.

Judge Nurul Amin Biplob sentenced four people to death for the seven-year-old murder. But he acquitted controversial blogger Shafiur Rahman Farabi.

Secular blogger Das, who was also an organiser of Sylhet Ganajagaran Mancha, was hacked to death in front of his house at Sylhet’s Subidbazar on May 12, 2015.

The four capital punishment recipients are Abul Hossain, 25, Faysal Ahmed, 27, Mamunur Rashid, 25, and Abul Khayer Rashid Ahmed, 24.

“The killers are members of an organised group. They killed Das in a planned way,” the judge said while delivering the verdict.

“Das was a person of scientific and progressive thoughts. He was involved in the practice of free thinking through his writing in the blog. The extremists brutally killed him in broad daylight to suppress his fundamental right to free speech and to forever silence his pen.”

“The killers were intended to terrorise those who believe in science and progressive thoughts and pen or speak against religious fundamentalism.”

“The death sentence of four in the case is a landmark verdict. Justice has been established through the verdict,” public prosecutor Muminur Rahman Titu said.

Das was hacked to death in front of his house at Sylhet’s Subidbazar on May 12, 2015.

A banker by trade, Das also wrote on science topics and edited a science magazine named ‘Jukti’. He was also an organiser of the local Ganajagaran Mancha.

His elder brother Ratneshwar Das started a murder case at Sylhet’s Airport Police Station a day after his death.

The case alleged that Das was killed in a pre-planned attack by religious extremists for writing about science.

“The murder of the victim was a heinous crime committed by the accused by instilling fear in people’s minds and disrupting public safety. It tarnished the international image of Bangladesh. Other militants, on the contrary, would be encouraged to carry out such crimes if these ones are not handed down exemplary punishment.”

Farabi was behind bars in another case during the killing of Das.

According to the sheriff's office, a parent whose children attend Dyer Elementary School reported ""multiple instances"" of a staffer's inappropriate physical contact with students. The alleged contact took place during the 2021-22 school year.

The staffer has been identified by the sheriff's office as Daniel Powers; he was terminated on April 19 for violating district policy, officials said. The district sent a letter to families on April 21 regarding a staff member's ""behavior.""

During the preliminary investigation, the sheriff's office said investigators developed probable cause that Powers ""victimized multiple students"" of the school. He was arrested on April 25 and jailed on referred charges of repeated sexual assault of a child (three counts) and misconduct in office (three counts), according to the sheriff's office.

The investigation is ongoing. The sheriff's office said it has reason to suspect there may be more victims. Anyone with information is asked to call investigators at 262-636-3323 or email andrew.willis@racinecounty.com.

In a statement, Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said:

""There is nothing more precious than the innocence of a child, and I pledge that I will bring the full force of the Sheriff’s Office to investigate every and all allegations of inappropriate conduct with children so that the perpetrator, if guilty, can be brought to justice and duly held accountable.""

Authorities had been on their way to arrest him in connection with the murder of social media star Alexis, according to The Daily Beast.

Alexis was found strangled to death and naked by the side of a road shortly after Thanksgiving last year.

ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP

In the days following her death Tom called his wife his ""world"" and called for the public's help in finding her when she disappeared.

""My world! My everything! I'm so lost right now! My one and only!"" he wrote. Following her death he called her ""the most amazing woman.""

But a different picture of the couple's marriage soon emerged from friends of Alexis who said she had been in an abusive relationship with Tom.

The Daily Beast reported that Alexis had allegedly told friends during a trip in early November that Tom was abusing her.

She apparently also claimed she was divorcing him.

A friend told the publication: “Throughout the trip, he was sending really awful, nasty messages to her.

“But one night when she and I were talking alone she said, ‘He strangles me and chokes me out and I blackout and wake up on the bathroom floor every single time.’”

'SCARED FOR HER LIFE'

One friend told ABC13 Alexis has been ""petrified"" in the weeks before her death. They did not elaborate on why but added: ""This girl is scared for her life.""

Another two friends claimed that on the day his wife disappeared, Tom had been arguing with her before she ""hopped over their patio fence and into a car.""

Local reports suggest that Alexis did not leave in her vehicle.

Her husband denied any marital problems, saying he was cooperating with detectives and felt confident police are ""going to find everyone that was involved.""

Tom denied having an argument with Alexis before she disappeared and claimed he was receiving death threats as her Instagram clout grew.

While denying the fight, Tom told the outlet: ""There are always other sides to everything.

""I don't need to set the record straight,"" he said. ""I'll let it play out the way it is. I know what my life was with my wife.""

TOM'S CLAIMS

He also claimed that his wife had been unhappy.

""She wasn't happy. She was stressed. I would cuddle her to try to make her strong,"" Tom told ABC13 on December 2, 2020.

It is unclear when Tom became wanted for the murder and when he moved away from Houston.

He had not been charged.

Alexis' Instagram account, which has now been memorialized, included pictures of her and Tom alongside her influencer pictures.

One photo posted on July 3 last year is captioned: ""I love this man.""

Tom posted a string of photos on social media after his wife, who he married in December 2019, was found dead, calling her ""the most amazing woman.""

FAMILY BLOCKED

Alexis' mom also revealed last year it took two weeks before Tom allowed her to see the body.

Stacey Robinault said she told her son-in-law 49, that she wanted to bring Alexis’ body home to Pennsylvania.

She told local news station KRIV: “As her husband, he would have primary custody of what determined what happened with her, and he had said all along that he was willing to let her come home.”

Robinault said Tom cut off communication and eventually, the medical examiner made her the next of kin.

“I didn’t think I was gonna get her, and I had actually given up hope, when all of the sudden the forensics lab called me,” Robinault said.

“It just was a very strange – I’d almost call it ‘fight’ to get her.”

LAST SEEN

The couple had moved to Houston in January 2020 after marrying the month before.

Alexis was last seen the day after Thanksgiving in their apartment.

Friends had last heard from her at around 6pm that day, and after that phone calls began going straight to her voicemail.

A city worker found Alexis' body dumped at the side of a road in Houston on November 28 last year.

The influencer – who had 21,000 followers on Instagram – had no visible injuries.

TOM FOUND DEAD

Ever since Chan Yin-lam, a 15-year-old student of Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI), was found dead in the sea off Yau Tong on Sept. 22, there has been a lot of speculation about the cause of her death.

Just this Wednesday, hundreds of students gathered again on the HKDA campus to ask the school to release additional CCTV footage regarding Chan. Failing to get that and to have a dialogue with the school's vice-principal, the students went on a rampage and vandalized a lot of campus facilities.

We agree that Chan’s death deserves further investigation, and many professionals have also called on the Coroner's Court to launch an inquiry to unravel the mysteries surrounding her death.

But is it necessary for the students to use violence in their bid to seek the truth?

It is unwise for them to voice their concerns and demand action by means of intimidation and coercion, particularly in an academic community where people are supposed to use reason and virtue to make a point.

Since the outbreak of the anti-extradition bill movement, a lot of students have been engaged in political disputes, with some of them suspected of having committed serious crimes such as rioting, arson and criminal damage during protests.

According to statistics compiled by media, between June 9 and Oct. 25, police arrested some 780 students, who accounted for over 30 percent of all the protest-related arrests.

Among them, 264 are students from the 11 tertiary institutions, which is definitely worrying.

Learning to be inclusive, to be respectful and to make compromises might sound a bit of a cliché these days, but isn't it still necessary and inspiring at a time when Hong Kong is witnessing its worst unrest in decades?

While we believe that it is a noble cause for students and other citizens to fight for freedom and human rights, we also believe it is equally necessary for them to respect others’ freedom from fear, and incumbent upon them to avoid resorting to violence.

Kingston, who died this month at 62, was insatiably curious. She was driven to demand better of everything and everyone. Hers was the calibre of journalism that left editors’ minds spinning, and competing writers — myself included — jealous and desperate to understand her magic formula.

Kingston peeled back layers. She exposed the complicated machinery behind curtains of power. She went literary places others dared not go. Her bio on the Maclean’s magazine website said ""Senior writer and columnist Anne Kingston covers contemporary culture — everything from medical politics to the politics of food.""

That’s range.

Maclean’s was home to her final bylines, which some may see as a curious place for a feminist to hang her hat. But she was never afraid of a challenge, including being outnumbered by men in newsrooms most of her career.

Today’s intersectional third- and fourth-wave feminist activists roll their eyes at the cautious complicity of the second-wave feminist generation into which Kingston was born in 1957. But Kingston was neither cautious nor complicit. Her strong character and critical mind were shaped in part by growing up in a single-parent household. She saw injustice and wrote about it.

Throughout her career she questioned everything from Canada’s relationship to the monarchy to our so-called world class health care system to intimate partner violence, long before the Women’s March became a thorn in the side of the current U.S. president.

And everyone from sharp young court reporters to seasoned editors for Canada’s oldest magazine seems to agree that in the world of Canadian news media, Kingston’s writing had a special place.

Kingston covered Hollywood mogul and serial sexual predator Harvey Weinstein with fearlessness and ferocious critical insight right up until December, two months before she died of cancer.

Mandi Gray, a PhD candidate and feminist activist, saw the news media in action during the 2016 trial of a man charged with sexually assaulting her.

Kingston was different, she says.

""Anne Kingston was incredibly important for bringing issues of gendered inequality to a demographic of Canadians that are either ill-informed about the issues, or simply reject the premise that gender inequality exists,"" says Gray, who added that her father — a lifelong Maclean’s subscriber — is not the easiest arm to twist on gender justice. But he read Kingston’s columns anyway.

""I met Anne at a conference on campus sexual violence in 2016. I was surprised she made the trek to Kingston, Ontario, to sit through two days of a conference. She told me she was there to learn about what was happening on campuses across Canada,"" Gray continued.

""That really struck me. So rarely have I met journalists who are there to listen and learn (again, likely a perk of having full-time permanent employment). She wasn’t there just desperately searching for the next big headline about campus sexual violence. In our meeting, Anne was kind and thoughtful.""

The year 2016 could be classified as a cultural turning point in Canada. We had a new federal government. Celebrity CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi was on trial for sexual assault with multiple accusers.

Toronto Star reporter Alyshah Hasham met Kingston in the courtroom during that trial. Kingston was there for every brutal detail of testimony, but she wasn’t filing stories the same way Hasham was. As a columnist, Kingston took her time to observe and ruminate.

""Anne didn’t do stereotypical reporting,"" Hasham says. ""She was thoughtful, layered. She would contextualize things, including the advocacy happening outside the courtroom.""

Seated next to Kingston during the Ghomeshi trial was Sarah Boesveld, filing for Chatelaine.

""She treated me as a colleague and an equal, despite the many questions I peppered her with,"" says Boesveld. ""We shared observations about what was playing out in front of us — hers so incisive and intelligent it felt like she was on a different plane from the rest of us. Seeing more, understanding more.""

""Despite Anne being such a wonderful generalist, I feel like she really made her mark writing about gender dynamics and issues that affect women’s lives,"" adds Boesveld. ""I looked up to her immensely while working that beat at Chatelaine. While the rest of us needed so much time to absorb what was going on in front of us duri",[],"['Jian Ghomeshi', 'Alyshah Hasham', 'Anne Kingston journalist', 'British Columbia Media', 'Canadian media', 'Canadian newspapers', 'Digital Media', 'Future of News', 'I regret having children feature', 'Jess Brown Canadaland', 'Journalism', 'Journalism in Canada', 'Julie Delahanty', 'Mandi Gray', 'Media in British Columbia', 'Media in Canada', 'Michael Geist', 'New Media', 'Newspapers in Canada', 'Sarah Boesveld Chatelaine', 'Sarmishta Subramanian', 'Steve Anderson', 'intersectional feminism', 'second-wave feminism']",set(),['Jenn Jefferys'],2020-02-24 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,Sharply critical and a fine writer — she blazed her own path.,en,/design-article.thetyee.ca/ui/img/favicon.ico,https://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2020/02/24/Anne-Kingston-Feminist-Journalist-Difference/,<Element div at 0x7f209fbb14a0>,<Element div at 0x7f209fc1fbd0>,<Element html at 0x7f209fc1cbd0>,<Element html at 0x7f209fc1c9a0>,{},91dfd0d18284e022db6e04c297105f6d.1652374337.852204,gdelt_events,12-05-2022,bd9c5ae9-4443-2f36-554a-f9127033c837,2020_01_01-2020_02_29_gdelt_data.csv

President considers releasing prisoners charged with minor offences

Mar 24, Colombo: Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has directed the legal experts and the Department of Prisons to look into ways of granting some relief to the prisoners who were charged with minor offences and those who were jailed for being unable to meet their bail conditions.

President issued these instructions during a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat today (24) with the members of the committee appointed to make recommendations on the possibility of providing legal redress for the prisoners who had committed minor offences.

Steps were taken to provide relief to the inmates following an inspection tour by the President at an earlier occasion.

The Committee is scheduled to meet the President again on March 26 to submit their recommendations on granting legal reliefs for inmates who are currently unable to pay fines or pay for bail money or produce personal bail.

The Committee of Lawyers consists of officials of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Department of Prisons.

Commissioner General of Prisons Jayasiri Tennakoon, Director General of Legal Affairs of the Presidential Secretariat, Hariguptha Rohanadheera, Deputy Commissioner of Prisons, Venura Gunawardhana, President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, Secretary Kaushalya Navaratne, President’s Counsel Shavendra Silva, and Attorney Susara Dinal participated in this meeting.",[],"['Lanka', 'Sri Lanka', 'lanka news', 'sri lanka news', 'breaking news', 'ceylon', 'NEWS']",set(),"['Gamini Gunaratna', 'Sri Lanka News Paper Lankapage.Com', 'Llc - Latest Hot News Sri Lanka']",,,,True,2.0,,Sri Lanka : President considers releasing prisoners charged with minor offences  (Sri Lanka - latest news stories and top headlines),en,,,<Element span at 0x7ff4b468fae0>,<Element span at 0x7ff4b42c9d60>,<Element html at 0x7ff4b40d8ea0>,<Element html at 0x7ff4b42c9720>,{},1792cacbf228289e159e440df791a68f.1652349433.823753,gdelt_events,12-05-2022,1eec339c-02f3-23df-f9d7-a41307808bd4,2020_03_01-2020_04_30_gdelt_data.csv

The Quebec Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a guilty verdict in a 2016 trial that convicted a Montérégie daycare worker of having assaulted an infant in her care.

The province’s highest court has ordered a new trial be held for Véronique Lalonde, who was found guilty of aggravated assault and sentenced to two years in prison.

Superior Court Justice Serge Champoux based his judgment on expert testimony that the infant had suffered a non-accidental head trauma commonly referred to as “shaken baby syndrome.”

The prosecution had argued that the trauma suffered by the infant occurred in the moments before the symptoms appeared, a conclusion that led to a guilty verdict for Lalonde, who had been caring for the child when the symptoms manifested themselves on April 2, 2012.

But another theory was raised during the trial by the defence in the form of testimony from a pediatric neurosurgeon specializing in infant epilepsy. The witness, who performed first aid on the child when he arrived in hospital, said the symptoms corresponded more closely with convulsions associated with a trauma received anywhere from two to 10 days before April 2, when the baby was in the care of his mother, father or grandmother.

(Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, will be arraigned on July 14 on charges of luring underage girls so that the financier, now dead, could abuse them, according to a court order issued Tuesday evening.

Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan federal court said a bail hearing would be held at 1 pm EST that day via video conference.

Maxwell, 58, arrived at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on Monday. She was arrested on July 2 at a mansion in New Hampshire, where investigators said she had been lying low.

Prosecutors said Maxwell groomed girls so Epstein abuse them at lavish homes in Palm Beach, Florida; New Mexico and Manhattan.

Epstein was awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking minors between 2002 and 2005 when he was found hanged in a federal facility in Manhattan in August. Medical examiners concluded his death was a suicide.

Nathan said on Tuesday that to optimize video quality, only the judge, Maxwell, her lawyer and a prosecutor would appear on video at the hearing. The judge said others could access audio of the hearing by telephone.

In response, several of the continent's regimes have shut down the internet or blocked social media apps. To sidestep the economic costs and global criticism that these online shutdowns incur, governments have turned to digital surveillance technology as a shrewder way to crush all opposition.

In a recently-released report titled ""Running in Circles: Uncovering the Clients of Cyberespionage Firm, Circles"", the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab — which investigates digital espionage against civil society — details how government agencies in Botswana, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe are using the surveillance technology developed by Israeli telecom company Circles to snoop on the personal communications of opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists. These seven African countries are among 25 around the world using Circles, which is affiliated with the notorious NSO Group whose invasive Pegasus spyware has been used to target human rights defenders and journalists around the world.

How does it work?

Circles technology is sold to nation states only, and intercepts data from 3G networks, allowing the infiltrator to read messages and emails, and listen to phone calls in real time. Using only the telephone number, a Circles platform can identify the location of a phone anywhere in the world within seconds.

Circles exploits flaws in Signalling System No.7 (SS7), the set of protocols that allows networks to exchange calls and text messages between each other. This allows government agencies to track individuals across borders without a warrant, bypassing international conventions.

In 2019, 3G became the leading mobile technology in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for over 45 per cent of all connections. With the faster — and possibly more secure — 4G networks being at least five years away from becoming the standard for mobile connectivity on the continent, Circles' 3G-manipulating technology is ideal for power-hungry African leaders looking to cling to power by spying on critics.

The spying revelations came as African governments — including some named in the Citizen Lab report — are cracking down brutally on protestors and opposition groups.

Nigeria

Recent #EndSARS protests triggered a deadly response from Nigeria's state security apparatus, with the government able to infiltrate the movement's organisational structures successfully.

Citizen Lab identified two Circles systems in Nigeria that both began operating in June 2015. One of them was being used by the Nigerian Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA). In 2016, the governors of Delta and Bayelsa states also purchased Circles systems to spy on political opponents and critics. The presence of Circles products in Nigeria goes back more than a decade, when former Rivers state governor, Rotimi Amaechi, became the first Nigerian politician to use the surveillance technology in 2010.

Circles' government clients in Nigeria have a long history of abusing surveillance technologies to conduct mass surveillance of citizens' telecommunications. Femi Adeyeye, a Lagos-based political activist who has been detained several times for criticising the Nigerian government, is not surprised that Muhammadu Buhari's regime is using the invasive spying technology.

Adeyeye cited several cases where Nigerians were swiftly traced, arrested and detained after criticising the government. These include journalists Omoyele Sowore, Abubakar Idris Dadiyata and Stephen Kefas. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has also reported numerous cases of the Nigerian authorities abusing phone surveillance by targeting journalists' phones to reveal and track sources for stories investigating government corruption.

""We are already in the worst stage of dictatorship,"" warns Adeyeye. ""Freedom of expression, media, and political association have been further weakened by this spying technology.""

He says that Nigerian political analysts now self-censor when commenting on national political issues, after witnessing the government's infiltration of #EndSARS. ""They have seen how people have been traced, their passports seized and bank accounts frozen, and how they have been forced to go into exi",[],[''],set(),[],2021-02-24 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210224-african-governments-are-crushing-opposition-using-israeli-spyware/,<Element div at 0x7f5f817bb950>,<Element div at 0x7f5f8327c130>,<Element html at 0x7f5f82fd8d60>,<Element html at 0x7f5f82fd8590>,{},2ff9a0d6090f999bb3b69d5e85e3cdc8.1652113110.828551,gdelt_events,09-05-2022,c1b51688-1f0f-f1ba-43c4-e98da240874b,2021_01_01-2021_02_28_gdelt_data.csv

filmed demolition

Authorities in the city of Santiago de Cuba demolished a church that has long been a target of the communist regime and arrested a pastor who streamed the demolition live on social media, a human rights group has reported.

According to the London-based nonprofit Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Cuban State Security brought heavy machinery and bulldozers to the Assemblies of God Church in the Abel Santamaria neighborhood of Santiago de Cuba last Friday and destroyed the church.

CSW added that the church has been under threat since 2015 even though the denomination is one of the largest religious groups in Cuba and is legally recognized by the government.

Pastor Alain Toledano who lives in the same neighborhood and pastors another church recorded the government attack on the church and broadcast it on Facebook Live through his mobile phone.

However, he dropped the phone on the ground as he was approached by men wearing plainclothes. As the video feed was cut, the sound of bulldozers could be heard as members of the church sang in the background.

Cuban police then took Toledano, a leader of the unregistered denomination the Apostolic Movement, to the Motorizada Police Station. According to CSW's report Friday, he is being kept incommunicado.

Cuban authorities have claimed that the demolition was for the construction of train tracks on the site, but CSW sources said the church was the only building in the neighborhood that was destroyed.

“Officials at the Cuban Physical Planning and Housing Departments first attempted to demolish the church in 2015 but backed off after members of the church and other denominations, led by Rev. Fausto Palomo, held a peaceful sit-in in the building,” CSW's report noted. “They also threatened to confiscate the homes of those living on the property in 2015.”

Pastor Toledano’s actions “demonstrated cross-denominational solidarity and we commend his courage in bearing witness to government attacks on Reverend Fausto Palomo and the members of his church,” CSW CEO Scot Bower said. “We call on the Cuban authorities to immediately release Pastor Toledano and to cease its targeting of him and his family.”

In July, Cuba released Pastor Ramon Rigal, who spent over a year in prison for homeschooling his children, according to a statement by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent and bipartisan panel of experts that advises Congress and the federal government.

Rigal, who was arrested with his wife, Ayda Expósito, in April 2019, was serving a two-year term and was previously scheduled to be released in 2021. Although it’s unclear why he was granted early release, it came as the government had released thousands of prisoners in previous months to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Last December, the U.S. State Department placed Cuba on its “special watch list” of countries that engage in or tolerate severe violations of religious freedom.

In a March report, USCIRF detailed how Cuban authorities manipulated the legal system to “wage persistent harassment” against religious leaders. The panel also voiced concerns over the denial of religious freedom for human rights activists and journalists.



CSW notes that Toledano has also been a target of the government since his ministry began in 2003. And over the past 15 years, his church was demolished twice. Toledano was put on a government list of Cubans who are prohibited from leaving the country.

misconduct. (AAP: Paul Braven)

A Sydney court has been told former NSW Labor ministers Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald must go to jail for conspiring over a lucrative mine licence.

After a year-long trial, Eddie Obeid, 77, his middle son Moses, 51, and Macdonald, 72, were found guilty of conspiring over a coal exploration licence.

The licence was granted over the Obeid family farm in the Bylong Valley near Mudgee, when Macdonald was Resources Minister from 2007 to 2009.

The deal led to a $30 million windfall for the Obeid family.

Justice Elizabeth Fullerton is hearing sentencing submissions for the men who are appearing in court via video.

The judge noted that the offence of conspiracy was a common law offence, not a legislated one, so has no maximum sentence.

Crown Prosecutor, Sophie Prosecutor Callan SC, said Eddie Obeid was previously jailed for five years for misconduct over Circular Quay Cafe leases, and that the mine licence conspiracy was even more serious.

""The objective seriousness is at the high end, because it included a breach of office by a Minister "" Ms Callan said.

Justice Fullerton asked Ms Callan if a full time custodial sentence was the only option the Crown would consider.

""Yes,""' Ms Callan replied.

The judge noted that Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald had tendered a string of letters from medical professionals to argue why they should not go to jail.

They include letters from GP's, a neurologist, an ophthalmic surgeon, a gastroenterologist, details of an appointment with a psychologist and brain surgeon, and details about how COVID was being mentioned in the state's jails.

The court heard Macdonald suffers incontinence and might need a surgery.

The Mumbai Police have accused Republic TV, along with Box Cinema and Marathi channel Fakt Marathi, of manipulating TRPs.

Shaikh has also sought Rs 5 lakh as damages, saying the “defamatory reports” published against the Mumbai Police have resulted in his mental agony. The plea, filed through advocate Abha Singh, said that Republic TV and its Hindi news channel Republic Bharat have indulged in a “smear campaign” against the Mumbai Police.

The plea also claimed that the defendant, Arnab Goswami, can not “be granted the liberty to discuss his own case and arbitrate it in his own TV channels by defaming Mumbai Police” when an investigation was underway.

Shaikh alleged that Goswami was conducting debates and airing stories that might influence the investigation, according to the Hindustan Times. “The plaintiff submits that the Defendant No. 1 has transgressed his limits as an owner of two most popular TV Channels and has started pursuing his own agenda by being the Editor-in-Chief and by blurting out large sermons about his own case which is under probe by a statutory body,” the plea said.

Shaikh also alleged that Republic TV was trying to topple the investigation by launching a libellous campaign against the Mumbai Police, citing statements Goswami used against the force’s chief Param Bir Singh.

It also said that Goswami is the owner and director of the company that runs the news channels, its editor-in-chief and the main anchor of the debates. The suit argued that this was in “open contempt” to the Press Council of India guidelines, which state that the owner/management has to be distinct from the editor.

The case will be taken up for hearing on October 21.

The TRP row

A fake TRP racket was uncovered earlier in October when the Broadcast Audience Research Council filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. Hansa Research is one of BARC’s vendors on engagement with panel homes, or “people’s meters”. Republic TV, Box Cinema and Marathi channel Fakt Marathi were accused of TRP manipulation during the preliminary investigation.

Last week, the Broadcast Audience Research Council decided to pause weekly ratings for news channels for three months and review its measurement system, amid a row over the alleged manipulation of TRP.

On October 14, Republic TV’s Executive Editor Niranjan Narayanaswamy and Senior Executive Editor Abhishek Kapoor appeared before the crime branch of the Mumbai Police to record their statements in the case.

The Mumbai Crime Branch said on October 12 that they had arrested a former Hansa Research employee named Vinay Tripathi from Uttar Pradesh. The officials said that he played a key role in the scam and had paid another accused to manipulate ratings. The police also recorded the statements of two senior officers from Hansa Research.

The police have also arrested the owners of Box Cinema and Marathi channel Fakt Marathi, Shirish Shetty and Narayan Sharma.

Republic TV Chief Executive Officer Vikas Khanchandani had appeared before the Mumbai for questioning in case on October 11. The TV channel’s Chief Financial Officer Shiva Subramaniyam Sundaram was supposed to appear before the police on the previous day, but he asked for a reschedule citing “personal commitments”.

The Information and Broadcasting Ministry, and a parliamentary panel on information technology have noted that TRP measures are not in tune with the current technologies. They also observed that the English news space, because of its minuscule size, is particularly susceptible to manipulation.",[],"['India', 'Arnab Goswami', 'Republic TV', 'TRP scam', 'Iqbal Shaikh', 'Television Rating Points', 'Mumbai Police', 'Param Bir Singh', 'Fakt Marathi']","{'Covid-19', 'TRP scam', 'Republic TV', 'Television Rating Points', 'Media Matters', 'Mumbai Police', 'Arnab Goswami', 'Iqbal Shaikh'}",['Scroll Staff'],,,,True,2.0,,Former Assistant Commissioner of Police Iqbal Shaikh sought to restrain the channel from airing any material related to the case and Rs 5 lakh as damages.,en,https://scroll.in/static/assets/favicon.5f31c86209ff21c26b68aabf47772769.003.png,https://scroll.in/latest/976304/trp-scam-ex-police-officer-files-case-against-arnab-goswami-republic-tv,<Element div at 0x7f41355bee00>,<Element div at 0x7f412f69d360>,<Element html at 0x7f412f69d950>,<Element html at 0x7f412f69df40>,{},55dd14e2c58f12a235b6327a74e9a664.1652186582.8141592,gdelt_events,10-05-2022,ee5970c0-7a2c-7cef-4591-011347222cde,2020_09_01-2020_10_31_gdelt_data.csv

Somali Television Network (STN) station, operating from Garowe, the regional administrative capital of Puntland was shut down this evening by Puntland police while journalist Abdifatah Muse alias Jiib who is working for STN TV was also arrested. Jiib was arrested because he recorded a vox pop from members of the public about an address the Puntland president Said Abdullahi Deni made on the evening of February 21, 2021.

“These are dangerous days for journalism in Puntland,” said Omar Faruk Osman, NUSOJ Secretary General. “It doesn't fool anybody as this repressive campaign is a warning to Puntland journalists and to the people in particular to toe the line in the run-up to Somalia elections both for Federal Parliament and for President in the coming weeks. This cannot continue and Puntland authorities must change course, if not it will be a disaster for democratisation efforts currently being undertaken in Puntland”.

Another journalist, Ahmed Botan Arab who was arrested for similar reasons on 22 February 2021 was released yesterday evening. While he was released without charges, the authorities warned him not to broadcast similar contents of interviews with members of the public.

Unfortunately, these incidents are not isolated and represent a sustained assault on media freedom and the public' right to receive and impart opinion through media of their choice.

Independent Journalist Kilwe Adan Farah is now serving his 60th day in detention in Garowe after he was arrested by the Puntland secret services (PISA) on 27 December 2020. Initially he was kept for more than two weeks in incommunicado detention.

NUSOJ calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Abdifatah Muse and Kilwe Adan Farah, and for STN TV to be allowed to resume its operations.

“Puntland has been using its security apparatus to silence any critical voices and journalists continue to be victims of this repressive tactic,” declared Osman. “Numerous attacks on journalists, news media organisations and denial of access to information had already created a dangerous climate for journalists who will be under further pressures in the run-up to national elections. Puntland must allow journalists and media houses to work independently without fear of reprisals.”

“We particularly call on Puntland President Said Abdullahi Deni to end these politically motivated attacks and allow journalists to work freely and independently so they can perform their duties without undue interference from the authorities,” he stressed while adding that “journalists and the general population of Puntland have a right to protection under the law and the regional administration has a duty to ensure that basic rights are enjoyed as set out in state and federal laws”.",[],[''],set(),[],,,,True,2.0,,"Following the closure of an independent television network and the arrest of another journalist, the National Union of Somali Journalists NUSOJ condemns the continued campaign against independent journalism in Puntland State of Somalia, and calls on Puntland authorities to change course.

We at the Cryptosphere are very proud to support the Internet Ungovernance Forum from the Pirate Party International. The conference runs from November 9-13 in Paraíba, Brazil, and features some of the most prominent names in the world of digital freedoms.

It began in Turkey as a counterpoint to the more establishmentarian Internet Governance Forum, giving voice to those shut out by organizations and individuals in control of the digital pipeline.

Speakers include Canada’s own Gabriella Coleman, the only professor of anthropology who has specialized in the study of Anonymous.

Birgitta Jonsdottir, the Pirate MP of Iceland, will be speaking Tuesday along with David Miranda, who has been detained on the basis of simply being the husband of “inconvenient” journalist Glenn Greenwald. Other speakers include Adriano Belisario, Danny O’Brien, Theo Oliveira, and Peter Sunde, co-founder of The Pirate Bay.

All of the talks are being livestreamed, so you can follow along in real time. We’ll have the embeds just as soon as we have a YouTube or Vimeo URL for each one.

Press Release:

Internet Ungovernance Forum Brazil is for those of us who demand free, secure, and open internet for all! The IUF are organising the Internet Ungovernance Forum on 9th – 13th November 2015, for everyone who demands that fundamental freedoms, openness, unity and net neutrality remain the building blocks of the Internet… Their objective is to talk about the true and real problems of the internet, how can we solve them and to chart a path for action… The forum will be in parallel to the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2015 which will also be held in João Pessoa in November. Interested parties all around the world will join and follow this important event. However, we see that at IGF the most urgent problems of the Internet do not get proper attention. Due to its format, the main perpetrators of many of the Internet’s problems, for example the governments and corporations, are getting representation in IGF that they don’t deserve. Given these circumstances, they decided to take initiative to defend the Internet as we know it and to create a parallel space to raise the voices of civil society initiatives, activists and common people… For us, the most vital problems today are censorship and freedom of speech; surveillance and privacy; excessive commercialisation and super-monopolies; protective, prohibitionist and conservative governance approaches; awful governance examples as in the case of Brazil and the list goes on. Further, we do not see any of these problems independent of the greater political, social and economic contexts in which the Internet and related digital infrastructures are embedded in… We want to reclaim the Internet as a fundamental infrastructure of our societies, cities, education, health, work, media, communications, culture and everyday activities… We call on our participants to resist seeing the problems of the Internet as only technological and void of its materiality…

Thousands came out to protest in the Hebron and Ramallah areas.

The family of Nizar Banat, originally from the southern West Bank town of Dura, says that he was severely beaten by the Palestinian forces during his arrest. Rumors emerged on Thursday early morning that he had been evacuated to a hospital, and the Hebron District Bureau announced Banat's death a short while later. On Palestinian social media, he is being declared a ""shahid,"" or martyr.

Protesters in Hebron and Ramallah accused the PA of carrying out a political assassination, while some clashed with Palestinian police in Ramallah. Protesters also called on President Abbas and the PA to be ""overthrown.""

Banat, a former member of the Fatah movement, has been repeatedly arrested by the Palestinian Authority for his sharp criticism of its leadership in Facebook posts and videos. He accused them of corruption, as well as abandoning and profiteering off of Palestinian national interests in return for personal benefit and wealth.

Human rights groups and Banat's family said that the autopsy showed that he suffocated from blood in his lungs after being beaten by security forces. One of the doctors who took part in the autopsy also revealed that Banat suffered injuries to all parts of his body, including his head and limps. The doctor said the circumstances raised suspicion of criminal wrongdoing.

Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced the Palestinian Authority would initiate a commission of inquiry into the circumstances of Banat's death, but demonstrations still sprung up in Hebron and the Ramallah area. Posters circulating on social media compared Banat to Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in 2018 in the country's Turkish consulate.

On their part, Hamas responded to the incident by encouraging mass participation in Banat's funeral, and calling on the Palestinian public to ""change the dangerous reality dictated by the Palestinian Authority and security coordination in the West Bank.""

According to Palestinian activists, Banat's home is located in the area of Hebron city that is under Israeli security control, so Palestinian forces must receive permission from Israel to enter the area and carry out arrests.

He has also castigated Mohammed Dahlan – a rival of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas – and his supporters, many of whom are former members of the Palestinian security establishment.

One of the last videos he posted on Facebook was about the Israel-PA vaccine agreement, in which Israel was to provide the Palestinians with Pfizer coronavirus vaccines that are set to expire soon in exchange for doses that Pfizer will send to Israel next year. Many members of the Palestinian public, which already has a high rate of vaccine skepticism, were convinced that the PA was intentionally hiding the particulars of the deal.

Banat claimed in his video that if Palestinians were to have died from receiving expired vaccine doses, Israel would have been accused of mass extermination – ""an accusation it could not have tolerated,"" which is why the deal was leaked.

Banat was a candidate for the Liberation and Dignity party, which planned to run in the Palestinian parliamentary elections that were originally scheduled for May 22, but were canceled by Abbas.

Palestinian activists who criticize the PA report that its security apparatuses are exerting more pressure against them in an attempt to silence them, and that many have been arrested or called into meetings to be rebuked in past weeks. Earlier this week, Issa Amro, an activist and resident of Hebron, was also arrested by the PA after writing a critical social media post; he was released the next day.

The commission of inquiry announced by the Palestinian Authority will be led by the Justice Minister Mohammed al-Shalaldeh, alongside an independent human rights professional, a doctor representing the family, and a representative from Palestinian intelligence.

Democratic Republic of Congo have raised allegations of sexual abuse by aid workers during an Ebola outbreak, a report said on Wednesday.

They said they were sexually exploited or abused in acts that included alleged rape or led to unwanted pregnancies by men in the east of the country, The New Humanitarian (TNH) and the Thomson Reuters Foundation said.

The men offered them jobs in exchange for sex, identifying themselves as working for major aid organisations.

Three of the seven organisations named are UN agencies, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), which features in 14 of the claims.

The allegations centre on Butembo, a major trading city and an epicentre of the 2018-2020 outbreak of Ebola that claimed 2,200 lives.

The investigators said: 'One woman said she was raped by a man who said he was with the WHO, and reporters learned of three others who said they had become pregnant.

'One of those women died after a botched abortion as she tried to conceal the pregnancy from her husband and children, her sister said.'

The fight to roll back the Ebola epidemic, Democratic Republic of Congo's worst ever, has been tarred by allegations of sexual abuse by well-paid aid workers who flooded into the poor region.

A probe last year by TNH, a news agency that covers humanitarian crises, gathered testimony from 51 women who said they had suffered sexual exploitation in Beni.

The WHO, reacting to the latest accusations, said it had identified two women in Butembo as 'potentially having had sexually exploitative relationships with individuals' connected to the agency.

That information will be shared with an independent investigative commission set up last October, it said.

Spokesman Marcia Poole said: '(The) WHO is committed to taking prompt and robust action, including collaborating with relevant national authorities on criminal proceedings, in all cases where WHO staff may be found guilty of perpetrating (sexual exploitation and abuse).'

The new report said sexual predators also claimed to work for the UN's International Organization for Migration; the UN's children's fund, Unicef; the International Rescue Committee (IRC); International Medical Corps (IMC); the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA); and DRC's health ministry.

Most of the aid workers allegedly involved were Congolese, the report said.

The gunmen were said to have attacked the mosque in large numbers while residents were observing the evening prayers on Thursday.

Although the state government and police authorities have yet to confirm the incident, a local security source narrated how it occurred to Channels Television.

He said the bandits surrounded the mosque upon their arrival in the area and in the process, they took about 14 worshippers away to an unknown destination.

The gunmen were also reported to have carted away an unspecified number of cattle from Tudun Amada village, also in Giwa Local Government Area.

According to the locals, the assailants split into two groups for simultaneous operations, with some invading the mosque while the rest attacked some houses within the community.

Channels Television had reported that no fewer than 11 persons, mostly elderly women, were abducted by gunmen suspected to be bandits in neighbouring ​​Katsina State.

The incident occurred on Saturday morning at Shinfida Village in Jibia Local Government Area of the state.

Sources said the victims were abducted on their way to join other residents who earlier ran to a refugee camp for safety after their village came under attack by bandits last night.

Those kidnapped by the gunmen, according to sources, virtually lack the capacity to leave at the time most residents fled to safety due to their physical strength and some health conditions.

The assailants were also said to have planned to set the entire village of Shinfida on fire following the attack.",[],[''],set(),[],2022-03-12 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,,en,//www.channelstv.com/wp-content/themes/channels2016/images/favicon.ico,https://www.channelstv.com/2022/03/12/gunmen-abduct-14-worshipers-from-mosque-in-kaduna/,<Element div at 0x7fc099ab8e50>,<Element div at 0x7fc099ab8540>,<Element html at 0x7fc099ac9360>,<Element html at 0x7fc099ac9770>,{},1ec0affdb65c6a78f81f66961cbdfdaa.1651825282.5208158,gdelt_events,06-05-2022,10ea7e46-fc19-9077-0e29-18335f72d33d,2022_03_01-2022_05_06_gdelt_data.csv

“I was introduced to the world at the age of 15 as a pariah, as the scum of the earth,” Salaam said.

Salaam, along with four other teenage boys of color, was jailed for the rape and attack of a jogger in Central Park in 1989 only to be proven innocent in 2002. The group, commonly known as the Central Park Five, is now referred to as the Exonerated Five. Despite having his youth taken from him, the message Salaam shared with more than 180 students was one of hope.

The virtual program, titled “An Evening with Yusef Salaam,” was the keynote event of the College’s Black History Month celebration in February. The celebration also included lectures; a poetry performance; and a one-day symposium that included panel discussions addressing issues of current social and racial interest, service learning activities, and a candlelight ceremony in remembrance of the enslaved people who played a formative role in the College’s history.

During his Feb. 23 presentation via Zoom and YouTube, Salaam detailed how his Islamic faith grew while he was in prison. He said he began to “find freedom in prison, even though I was in bondage,” as he discovered meditation and read the sacred texts or many world religions. This faith journey behind bars helped establish a foundation for the rest of his life, he said, and gave him the “spiritual eyes” to look at his experiences in a positive light.

“When you open [your spiritual eyes], you see things differently,” Salaam said. “It gives me the opportunity to see the Central Park jogger case as a love story between God and his people.”

He explained that while the case was a grave injustice, the fact that they were eventually exonerated proved that the truth doesn’t stay buried. Now, he is using his platform to speak truth to power and educate people on disparities in the criminal justice system.

Nine students had the opportunity to ask questions, with topics ranging from his experiences in prison, to his writing style, to his faith, to the way he was represented in the media at the time of his arrest, and to his thoughts on police in America. Salaam’s answers were valuable for students majoring in criminal justice, religious studies, psychology, communications and more.

Kinsey Nguyen ‘23 posed the first question to Salaam and asked about the 2020 book “Punching the Air,” which Salaam co-wrote with Haitian-American author Ibi Zoboi. Nguyen, who is majoring in criminal justice, said she was nervous, excited and honored as she asked her question.

“Being able to hear his story from his own point of view was illuminating, and how he managed to turn all those negative feelings into something bigger than himself was truly inspiring,” Nguyen said. “Dr. Salaam was a great guest speaker to listen to, and I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to ask him my question and listen to all the insightful words he had to give.”

Salaam answered questions with great detail and thoughtfulness, sprinkled with wit and humor. He quoted people ranging from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to “the great philosopher Cardi B,” Salaam’s description of the popular rapper, songwriter and actress. Salaam read excerpts of his own poetry and told the story of writing one poem out on a napkin in prison.",[],[''],set(),[],,,,True,2.0,,,en,/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png,,<Element div at 0x7f6200e4fae0>,<Element div at 0x7f6200e4f680>,<Element html at 0x7f6200687e00>,<Element html at 0x7f5d742a5720>,{},961c84a92b2c5b48e29cf128c213982d.1652113327.9371483,gdelt_events,09-05-2022,7ed544db-ad11-720a-8b45-8639ef8508f7,2021_01_01-2021_02_28_gdelt_data.csv

Jack and Sheila Shelmerdine open up about their heartbreaking discovery in a new BBC Two programme that looks into how the killer, dubbed 'Doctor Death', got away with his crimes for so long.

The Shipman Files: A Very British Crime Story, made by filmmaker Chris Wilson, reveals that when the serial killer doctor began working in Hyde in 1977, Jack and Sheila were among his first patients to attend his surgery at Donneybrook Medical Centre.

The programme reveals that Shipman - who later established himself at another surgery in 21 Market Street - was also the GP for both sets of parents, including Jack’s father, Jack Snr, and Sheila’s mum, Alice.

Jack Snr died in 1979, aged 77, while Alice died in 1982 aged 75.

The GP was found guilty of killing 15 of his patients back in 2000, with the total number of victims said to be around 250.

It was two decades after their loved ones' deaths that the Shelmerdines discovered that Jack Snr was murdered by Shipman, and that Alice was likely murdered by him, when the inquiry into the doctor’s crimes was conducted, shortly after his conviction.

Jack Shelmerdine tells the documentary of his parents: “They were so close - they were inseparable. My father died just before their 50th wedding anniversary. We got the celebration all lined up, it was a month before then that he died.

“Both my parents were living with us. My father had retired. He wasn’t well - he had chronic bronchitis. He had a flare up and we called in Shipman. I think we left Shipman to it, more or less.

“He came downstairs and said to me, your father is very, very ill. He said I have given him an injection to help him sleep overnight and get some rest.

“Then we all went to bed and when we got up in the morning and my father wouldn’t wake up. We phoned Shipman and he said he would send an ambulance. That arrived and my father was taken into Tameside General Hospital. Then he passed away.

“My mother was absolutely devastated. I remember her saying, what are we going to do now? As though the world had stopped. It was almost more than she could take. All I could say was we had to get on with it.”

In 2000, when the Shipman Inquiry reviewed Jack Snr’s case, it concluded that he had been murdered by the doctor.

It ruled that the injection that Shipman had given him before bed was the cause of his death.

Sheila said: “I just couldn’t believe it.”

The episode goes on to explain that this is sadly not the only connection that the family had to Shipman’s crimes.

The inquiry also looked at Sheila’s mum, Alice - also a patient of Shipman - who died at home in 1982, aged 75.

Sheila said: “Someone went into my mother’s house and found her dead on the settee.”

Jack added: “The TV was on, the heating was on, her mother was sitting in a chair.

“Everything fitted the circumstances, but they couldn’t say 100 per cent, categorically, because no one had seen Shipman enter the premises.”

The average age of Shipman’s victims in Hyde was 76 - many of whom were living active lives.

Documentary maker Chris told the Manchester Evening News: “I lived in Manchester for about 10 years and when the news broke, I was working for Granada and BBC Manchester, forging my early filmmaking career.

“I didn’t do anything specific with regards to reporting on Shipman but it’s one of those stories which is lodged at the back of my mind that I never quite understood.

“I grew up in Skelmersdale and my doctor was exactly the same as Shipman in the sense that he would help with funeral arrangements of his patients and visit them in their homes.

“At the time I didn’t know a lot in detail about Shipman but the picture in my head was a man bumping off old decrepit ladies. There’s something about that detail that makes it seem not so bad,"" Chris added.

“There’s almost a sense that he’s not really a serial killer - the victims died at home and there was no blood and gore like you see in the films.

“But that just isn’t the case. For many of his victims, there was nothing wrong with them. They were fit and active members of the community.

MS PORTER: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today’s briefing. I have three updates at the top and then we’ll resume taking your questions. I’d like to start off today by noting the tragic passing of our friend and colleague Tejinder Singh, who was the founder and editor of India America Today. Tejinder covered the State Department for 11 years, participating in many State Department briefings both in person and also calling in every telephonic briefing. We already miss seeing his name in the question queue here today. Tejinder was well-known for being a kind and generous colleague, and also for keeping us on our toes with his questions. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and colleagues as we grieve his loss. And I speak for my colleagues here when I say that he was such a pleasure to work with for all of us, and his presence will be sorely missed.

Yesterday the United States began celebrating the first day of Pride Month. Not only do we recognize how far we have come in the fight for the protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons, but we also acknowledge the distance that remains on the path to full equality and equity.

The United States is committed to increasing U.S. engagement on LGBTQI+ issues intersectionally, working to ensure the same-sex spouses for our diplomats assigned abroad are afforded the same privileges and immunities as opposite-sex spouses, and empowering local movements and persons advancing the rights of LGBTQI+ persons. We are proud of our work with local and international partners to build a more inclusive global society for all LGBTQI+ communities.

We seek to increase the visibility of and address the acute challenges faced by particularly marginalized members of these communities, including women and girls, transgender, non-binary, and intersex persons. Although the United States still has work to do, we strive to lead by example in the promotion and protection of human rights for all persons.

And finally, as you know, Secretary Blinken was in Costa Rica yesterday and today, where he met with senior government officials from across the Central American region to discuss how our countries can work together to create a more democratic, prosperous, and secure region. They also worked to deepening the region’s collaborative approach to shared challenges of irregular migration.

Yesterday, the Secretary attended a meeting with foreign ministers and vice ministers from all seven Central American countries, as well as Mexico and the Dominican Republic. They discussed issues essential to the wellbeing of people in this region, including strategies for addressing root causes of migration and managing migration flows in and throughout the region; combating corruption and strengthening democratic institutions; generating inclusive economic growth; recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic; and healthy environmental stewardship.

Secretary Blinken also met yesterday with President Alvarado and Foreign Minister Solano of Costa Rica to discuss the strong partnership between our countries on migration, climate change, and security. In addition, he met with the foreign secretary of Mexico and the foreign ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to discuss vital work to address migration and other challenges within those countries.

This morning, Secretary Blinken visited a pair of joint U.S.-Costa Rican initiatives that show how the United States can successfully partner with the region to help build a better future. He first visited a neighborhood that benefits from “Sembremos Seguridad,” an initiative citizen security program for at-risk youth. He then visited an environmental stewardship initiative that sets a model for efforts to reduce deforestation and fight climate change in the region. He also sat down with a Costa Rican media outlet to communicate with local audiences and demonstrate support for media independence in Central America.

This trip is a part of the administration’s focus on Central America. Vice President Harris will be headed to the region next week to further advance our efforts to improve conditions for people of Central America, which also advances the interests of people in the United States.

And with that, we’ll give it a few minutes before taking your questions.

SINGAPORE, Jan 9 — A construction worker has sued his employer and dormitory operator for being forcibly locked up with about 20 other migrant workers after their roommate tested positive for Covid-19.

Rahman Mohammad Hasibur, a Bangladeshi, filed a claim last Monday (December 28) for S$215,000 (RM654,201) in damages for being falsely imprisoned in a dormitory room for 43 hours and emotional distress suffered.

The dormitory in Tuas, run by Joylicious Management, had come under fire last year after migrant workers rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) said on its Facebook page that it received a “distress call” that a group of foreign workers had been locked up for days.

The exact period they were confined for had been a subject of dispute — a dormitory manager told TODAY previously that the men had been locked in the room for “less than 24 hours”.

In Rahman’s statement of claim seen by TODAY, he alleges that he was locked up from around 10pm on April 19, a day after a roommate tested positive, to around 5pm on April 21.

He had to call the guardhouse each time he wanted to use the toilet, and guards would take 10 to 15 minutes to reach the room to escort them there, his lawyers from law firm Eugene Thuraisingam said in the statement.

Some of the men were running fevers in the hot and poorly ventilated room. They were transferred to a new room that was also locked from the outside on the afternoon of April 21 and were freed only after the police unlocked the door at 5pm.

“(Rahman) and his fellow migrant workers were robbed of their dignity and deprived of their fundamental human rights during the false imprisonment,” his lawyers said.

The Joylicious dormitory manager, who wanted to be known only as Thng, told TODAY then that they had “no choice” but to do so for the safety of some 800 workers staying there.

Reena Wong, the design director for the men’s employer V Spec Engineering & Supplies, had also sent an email to TWC2, asking the rights group to take its posts down and apologise.

In it, she elaborated on the trouble that the two allegedly problematic workers were causing, stating that the company may be compelled to take legal action against them.

“We believe two of our employees on work permit have been spreading false media claims and making a riot internally,” she said in the email. “For example, they had informed others that a fight had taken place inside the dormitory. I had checked with our other employees in the same dormitory and found that it is not true.”

A few days after the men were released, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) issued a stern warning to Joylicious.

“The dormitory operator was advised that it is unacceptable to forcibly confine the workers to their room,” MOM said then.

It added that V Spec, which consented to the confinement, would also not be allowed to hire new foreign workers, pending police investigations.

Rahman, who has since returned to Bangladesh, said in a statement: “Should I succeed in my action, I hope that it will deter other employers and dormitory operators from similar actions towards their employees and residents in their care.”

TODAY has contacted Joylicious Management and V Spec Engineering & Supplies for comment. ― TODAY",[],"['singapore', 'singapore migrant workers', 'covid-19', 'singapore migrant worker dormitories']",{'COVID-19'},[],2021-01-09 00:00:00,,,True,2.0,,"SINGAPORE, Jan 9 — A construction worker has sued his employer and dormitory operator for being forcibly locked up with about 20 other migrant workers after their roommate tested positive for Covid-19.
