          <h3>The Execution of Mujtaba al-Sweikat</h3>

          <h4>02-May-2019</h4>

          <span>
            <p>
              A Saudi student who gained admission to Western Michigan
              University was beheaded last week for charges associated with his
              participation in a pro-democracy protest.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was 17 years old, at the airport to catch a flight to the U.S.,
              where he planned to visit colleges and hoped to attend Western
              Michigan University, where he subsequently gained admission. But
              he was arrested for crimes related to participation in a
              pro-democracy protest before he could board the plane.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last week Saudi Arabia announced Mujtaba al-Sweikat was one of 37
              people executed for terrorism-related crimes. The human rights
              group Reprieve says al-Sweikat, who was arrested in December 2012,
              was convicted on the basis of a confession obtained by torture.
            </p>
            <p>
              CNN reported on court documents it obtained regarding al-Sweikat’s
              prosecution. According to the documents obtained by the
              broadcaster, al-Sweikat’s father, who served as his lawyer,
              portrayed his son as a diligent student, loyal to the kingdom of
              Saudi Arabia, who completed his final high school exams with a
              score of 94 percent. Although al-Sweikat confessed to throwing
              Molotov cocktails at security forces and running a chat group to
              help organize demonstrations, his father claimed in reality he
              joined the demonstrations just twice, for five minutes each time.
            </p>
            <p>
              "He was subjected to psychological and physical abuse, which
              drained his strength," his father reportedly said. "The
              interrogator dictated the confession to Sweikat and forced him to
              sign it so that the torture would stop. He signed it."
            </p>
            <p>
              United Nations human rights officials had previously written to
              Saudi officials regarding al-Sweikat’s case, using an alternative
              spelling of his name. In November 2016, they wrote in regard to
              information they had received that he “was routinely subjected to
              torture including suspension from his hands and feet, sleep
              deprivation, severe beatings with cables and shoes, cigarettes
              burns and pouring of cold water on his body during winter. He was
              put in solitary confinement for three months. As a result, Mr.
              Suwaiket suffers from a broken shoulder, sustained pain in back
              and knees and blood deficiency due to insufficient nutrition. He
              has been deprived of any medical care. Mr. Suwaiket was reportedly
              subjected to acts of torture until he confessed to armed
              disobedience against the king and to attacking, shooting and
              injuring security forces, civilians and passers-by … On 1 June
              2016, after several hearings, Mr. Suwaiket was convicted and
              sentenced to death by the [Specialized Criminal Court], on the
              sole basis of the confession extracted under torture.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The letter from the U.N. officials said that while they did not
              want to prejudge the accuracy of the accusations regarding
              al-Sweikat’s treatment, they were concerned about the decision to
              impose the death penalty in light of international human right
              conventions related to fair trials, due process, torture and
              protection of the rights of children (as al-Sweikat was a juvenile
              at the time the alleged crimes were committed).
            </p>
            <p>
              RELATED | Court filings show some executed by Saudi Arabia
              recanted confessions, said they were tortured A subsequent letter
              from U.N. officials, sent in July 2017 in relation to multiple
              cases, including al-Sweikat’s, faulted judges for failing to
              investigate the allegations of torture and forced confessions.
              “While it was raised in court that the confessions were forced and
              had been obtained under torture, no investigation was initiated by
              the judges. Instead the forced confessions were admitted as
              evidence and used as the basis for their convictions,” they wrote
            </p>
            <p>
              In a written response , Saudi Arabia’s mission to the U.N. said
              that al-Sweikat was not subjected to torture or ill treatment.
              They said the claim his shoulder was broken was false and that he
              suffered from shoulder-related pain for five years prior to his
              arrest due to “sports-related activities.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Saudi government officials also denied that his confession was
              extracted through torture and said he confessed “of his own free
              will.” They said that the judge "did not rely solely on the
              confession as evidence in his judgment but on the evidence
              provided, including the arrest and investigation records, witness
              statements, and the deliberations and statements made during the
              judicial proceedings."
            </p>
            <p>
              The Saudi mission wrote, “The lower court judgment sentenced
              Mojtaba Suwaiket to death after convicting him of committing
              crimes such as: manufacturing firebombs (Molotov cocktails) and
              supplying them to others for use against law enforcement officers;
              throwing firebombs at law enforcement officers and their vehicles;
              involvement in the targeting of a security patrol by opening fire
              on it; monitoring police officers, their location and their
              movements and transmitting the information to members of another
              cell who used it to implement one of their operations; concealment
              of wanted individuals charged with opening fire on security
              patrols and persons charged with launching attacks on private
              property; concealment of persons charged with setting fire to a
              security vehicle and stealing a machine gun and bulletproof vest
              from it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In a subsequent communication , the Saudi mission said
              al-Sweikat's death sentence was upheld on appeal by the Supreme
              Court, rendering it “final and enforceable.”
            </p>

              Western Michigan previously confirmed al-Sweikat was admitted in
              2013 but never enrolled. A university spokeswoman, Paula Davis,
              said Monday he was an applicant for pre-finance studies and
              English language. “We learned about his shocking death last week
              and grieve this tragic loss of a young life full of potential,”
              she said.

              The American Federation of Teachers, which represents Western
              Michigan faculty, was involved in campaigning for al-Sweikat’s
              release.

              “Saudi Arabia’s sickening criminal beheading of a young student,
              after he was tortured and held in solitary confinement for years,
              is a despicable violation of international law and basic
              humanity,” Randi Weingarten, the AFT president, said in a
              statement last week. “Condemned at 17, Mujtaba al-Sweikat was
              planning to attend Western Michigan University when he was
              arrested after attending a peaceful protest rally. Today, we
              discover this young man has been executed, along with more than 30
              others, in a ghastly display of state brutality.”

              “If it was not already clear, Saudi Arabia, under the leadership
              of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has moved to the top tier of
              the bloodiest regimes in world history,” she said. “We demand the
              U.S. government immediately condemn, in every way and with every
              means, this disgusting and outrageous crime.”
