Businesses irrespective of size are facing serious challenges such as the threat of significant declines in revenue, insolvencies and job losses in specific sectors. The sustainance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is also expected to be particularly difficult. Reports from the International Labour Organization predicts that the pandemic will have far-reaching impacts on labour market outcomes such as a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment.<\/p> <p>In Nigeria, the reality in its Labour Market is expected to be much worse, owing to the outdated and grossly insufficient provisions of the Nigerian Labour Act of 2004 which governs labour matters in Nigeria. This paper calls for fair regulations and\/or legislations in Nigeria whilst examining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on private labour relationships and exploring the various options available to employers and employees in mitigating the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a party\u2019s exposure to legal liability.<\/p> <p>INTRODUCTION<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>The Labour Act of 2004 offers merely basic and arguably primitive protection to employees in Nigeria such that its provisions are not in tandem with 21st century realities. The inadequacies of the Act have become manifest in light of the realities occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. While in more advanced climes, employees can expect some form of protection with respect to job securities and benefits, employees in Nigeria are more or less at the mercy of employers. Worse more is that the minimal provisions as encoded in the Labour Act in Nigeria fails to apply to the entirety of the Nigerian labour market.<\/p> <p>THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT VIS-\u00c0-VIS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC<\/p> <p>The relationship between the employer and the employee is largely a function of the employment contract. As held by the Supreme Court of Nigeria per Muhammad JSC in Iyere v. Bendel Feed and Flour Mill Ltd. the legal basis of employment between the employer and the employee is the contract of employment. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria such as the limitation imposed on movements, closure of non-essential businesses\/services and the lockdown pronounced in some states has necessitated an overhaul of the traditional performance of the obligations under the various employment contracts. For example, on the part of the employers, the reduction or outright loss of revenue due to little or no patronage from clients has directly impacted on their ability to sustain their obligations to pay wages to employees; while on the part of employees, the COVID-19 Regulations imposed by the President of Nigeria on March 30, 2020 has through the restrictions on movement, compromised an employee\u2019s ability to present his\/her self for work when required. Certainly, an employer may be desirous of relying on the employee\u2019s inability to show up for work as a reason to extinguish liability for not paying wages. However, technological advancements has provided adjustments which both parties can subscribe to, such as teleconferencing, email correspondence, and use of work-issued computers to enable an employee work from home.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Accordingly, where the adjustments as stated above can be reasonably applied, the issue of frustration of contract becomes mute. The Nigerian position on frustration of contract, as held by the Supreme Court per Adekeye JSC in Nwaolisah v. Nwabufoh is that a contract is frustrated when an unforeseen and unexpected event prevents its performance, with neither party being at fault for having caused the event that led to the frustration of the contract. The court set out examples of such events to include: subsequent legal changes or statutory impossibility and literal impossibility .<\/p> <p>The answer to the question of whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic will frustrate a contract of employment will definitely be case-specific and subject to an objective test such as the possibility of the business being carried on remotely or the practicability and implementation of the WHO Guidelines in the workplace , and whether or not the period of the restrictions caused by the pandemic had an ascertained duration . It is submitted that where the above issues are answered in the affirmative, the contract of employment may not be held to have been frustrated.<\/p> <p>Force Majeure clauses can also be invoked to extinguish the obligation on the part of an employer to perform his duties as specified in the contract of employment. However, force majeure clauses are contractual, that is, they must be incorporated into the contract of employment. Section 17(1) of the Labour Act which unfortunately is restricted in its application , gives an appearance of statutory flavor to force majeure events by requiring payment of only one-day\u2019s wage in the event of a temporary emergency or circumstances beyond the employer\u2019s control but subjects it to other limitations.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, there are a variety of options that can be considered by employers and employees to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. They are discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, LAY-OFFS, UNPAID LEAVE AND SHORT-TERM WORK<\/p> <p>By the provisions of the Section 11 of the Labour Act of 2004 and in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employer may terminate the contract of employment by notice or by payment of salary in lieu of notice. This can effectively be carried out anytime and without any explanation . The employer can also choose to lay off the employee to avoid or at least postpone redundancies<\/p> <p>Another alternative the employer can explore is Lay off. Laying-off indicates that the employer does not provide the employee with work, with the resultant effect that the employee also does not get paid. It is usually employed for business\/economic reasons . A lay-off can be permanent; where permanent, it may likely become subject to the same statutory provisions governing redundancy under the Labour Act or as governed under a contract of employment which may provide for compensation benefits. It can also be temporary, in which case, it is fully subject to the contract of employment entered into by the parties. It is instructive to note that a lay off when permanent is usually the effect of a redundancy exercise; however, redundancy under the Labour Act is defined as the \u201cinvoluntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of man power\u201d. As such, where a lay off occurs which is not the result of excess man power, the Labour Act will not give protection to such an employee as his\/her employment shall be governed strictly in line with the contract of employment as negotiated unilaterally by the employer. This leaves the employee at the mercy of the employer as is the case in any master-servant relationship .<\/p> <p>Where the lay-off is temporary, it is essentially an unpaid leave. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employers and employees may find the option of unpaid leave to be mutually beneficial. The employee is for all intents and purposes, relieved of his duty to work, and is also not entitled to payment for the period of the leave. This may be beneficial because it reduces cost on the part of an already economically-beleaguered employer and ensures job security for the employee. Sadly however, there is no express provision for unpaid leave in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Also, due to the fact that the Labour Act is silent on the issue of when an employee can take his\/her annual leave, employers may arbitrarily by agreement as a result of their enormous bargaining power, unfairly require qualified employees to utilise their annual leave during the period of the lockdown. It is however suggested that a fair renegotiated agreement be reached between the employer and the employee such as, reasonably reducing the number of leave days entitled to an employee in the given year of the lockdown. This may be desirable and fair given the circumstances as there is a need to strike a balance towards ensuring that the employee utilises his\/her leave when so desired and the employer makes the best of its resources by limiting the influx of employees utilising their annual leave all at the same time when the lock down is over.<\/p> <p>Short-term work denotes a diminution in work with a corresponding decrease in remuneration. This appears to be a much preferable approach, as both parties still perform their obligations, albeit, on a reduced scale. Lay-offs and short term work are not clearly contemplated by the provisions of the Labour Act and as such, employees are largely left subject to the terms of their respective contracts with the employers .<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>REDUNDANCY<\/p> <p>Section 20 of the Labour Act of 2004 defines redundancy as an involuntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of manpower. The section obligates an employer to, in the event of redundancy; inform the trade union or workers\u2019 representative concerned of the reason for and the extent of the anticipated redundancy . The principle \u201clast in, first out\u201d is also expected to be applied, subject to all factors of relative merit including skill, ability and reliability; and is also expected to, using his best endeavors, negotiate redundancy payments to any discharged workers who are not protected by any regulations made by the Minister of Employment, Labour and Productivity with respect to redundancy allowance. However, the position of the National Industrial Court as recently expressed in the case of Urinrin Digun-Aweto v. Ecobank Nigeria Limited is to the effect that for redundancy to be binding in a private contractual relationship, the redundancy policy must be provided for in the contract of employment.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>REDUCTION OF SALARY<\/p> <p>Due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, most employers have resorted to pay cuts or reduction of the employee\u2019s salary. Employers can adopt pay cuts in response to a corresponding decrease in the amount of work given to the employee or while maintaining the status quo on the amount of work done. These options, including the undesirable second option are available to the employer by reason of the insufficient provisions of the Labour Act. Section 7(1) of the Labour Act obligates an employer to within three months of the worker\u2019s period of employment; provide the worker with a written statement specifying the name of the employer or group of employers, nature of the employers business, period of notice to be given by party wishing to terminate the employment, rate of wages, manner and periodicity of payment of wages, hours of work, amongst others; and where there is to be a change in either of these, the employer shall within a month of the change, inform the worker of the nature of the change by a written statement. The employer does not however, have to comply with the above provision where there is a written contract of employment covering these matters. The reduction will largely be subject to the parties\u2019 freedom to contract which in most cases is dependent on the employer\u2019s terms.<\/p> <p>However, it is imperative to note that, an employer cannot unilaterally reduce an employee\u2019s salary. Salary reduction can only be done in compliance with the provisions of Section 7 or where such reduction is already envisaged in the contract of employment vide a hardship clause .<\/p> <p>Renegotiating the Contract of Employment Fairly: The basic requirement for the recognition of an employer-employee relationship is the existence of an enforceable contract of employment. To mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become necessary for the parties to an employment contract to renegotiate the contractual terms. The need for the employer to protect the continued existence of the business must be weighed alongside the employee\u2019s need for job security fairly. Where not already incorporated, the contract should be renegotiated to allow for salary reductions, redundancy packages, short-term work and unpaid leave. It is important to note that these renegotiated contracts are temporary in nature, spanning the duration of the pandemic. Failure to reach a consensus will most certainly lead to termination of employment and\/or litigation. This is another area in which the Labour Act of 2004 is grossly insufficient, as employees are subject more or less, to the whims and caprices of employers who have higher bargaining powers.<\/p> <p>In the United Kingdom, contracts of employment are governed by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 which prevents unreasonable attempts by employers to escape liability by rendering the offending clauses in contracts unenforceable. Therefore, any clause in an employment contract that prevents an employer from performing all or any of his obligations would be unenforceable, unless reasonable and fair. In addition, the employer is not allowed to render any contractual performance different in a substantial manner from that which was reasonably expected of the employee and the employer is also prevented from unreasonably excluding or restricting liability arising from its own breach of contract; and where possible negotiate fair compensation packages with the employee in the given event of a permanent lay off or termination of employment by way of redundancy.<\/p> <p>CONCLUSION<\/p> <p>There is an urgent need for a Labour Law that is up to date with 21st century realities that protects employees through wide all-encompassing clauses. This will prevent unreasonable reliance on concepts such as frustration of contracts to terminate contracts of employment unfairly.<\/p> <p>There is also a need for a statutory flavor in employment contracts to stipulate limitations for contract renegotiation in order to prevent the inclusion of unfair contractual terms and to ensure that employees are not taken advantage of. The Labour Act should also protect the employer\u2019s business where necessary, especially in circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore submitted that Nigeria should emulate the United Kingdom and put in place, relevant legislations that takes care of the issues as highlighted in this article.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3XEIP58NL226U5IJB3MWPAKP5RHZL5"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":505,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":965059720,"Input.title":"Tunisian regime deploys army as protests spread 10 years after Arab Spring","Input.publish_date":"2021-01-19 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Ten years after a revolutionary working class uprising toppled President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali, the Tunisian regime is deploying the army against demonstrations that have erupted in dozens of cities across the country.

At the beginning of the year, Mechichi\u2019s government was facing a wave of local strikes by teachers opposing its murderous policy of enforcing in-person learning despite the spread of COVID-19. At that point, Mechichi suddenly decided to declare a four-day curfew starting on the anniversary of Ben Ali\u2019s overthrow, January 14.<\/p> <p>Police officers face demonstrators during clashes in Siliana, Tunisia, Saturday, Jan.16, 2021. (AP Photo\/Hedi Sfar)<\/p> <p>This cynical and transparent manipulation of the pandemic as a pretext for repression failed to strangle mounting opposition. Unauthorized demonstrations took place in several cities including the capital, Tunis. On the night of the 14th, protesters went out in Kasserine, a largely working-class city in the southern-central district of Tunisia that was a center of the 2011 uprising against Ben Ali. Protesting the lack of jobs and of social support for the unemployed, they burned tires and faced off against the security forces.<\/p> <p>In Siliana, the population protested against police violence after videos appeared on social media showing a policeman beating a herdsman whose sheep allegedly got inside an official building. Police fired tear gas at demonstrators, who responded by throwing stones and blocking streets with flaming tires in order to delay deployments by the security forces. On January 15, the police trade unions tried to calm the growing anger by presenting a statement of apology to the herdsman.<\/p> <p>In the following days, protests grew and spread in working-class districts of Tunis like Ettadhamen and Al-Karm, as well as Kasserine, Sbeitla, Bizerte, Beja, Kairouan, and Monastir. Clashes between security forces and youth were also reported in Manzel Bourguiba, Sousse, and Nabeul, as well as in other cities.<\/p> <p>On January 17, as the Tunisian Interior Ministry announced the arrest of 242 people, Defense Ministry spokesman Mohamed Zikri confirmed that the army would be deployed against protesters in the regions of Siliana, Kasserine, Bizerte and Sousse. Army units were also sent to the center of Tunis. Zikri confirmed that the goal of the military\u2019s intervention was to prevent the population from storming key government buildings.<\/p> <p>In a sign of growing panic in ruling circles, the General Union of Tunisian Labor (UGTT), the national labor union historically tied to the Ben Ali regime, issued a statement to denounce and try to demoralize the movement.<\/p> <p>While criticizing police repression as \u201cineffective\u201d and declaring the social anger of the youth to be \u201clegitimate,\u201d the UGTT denounced the demonstrations as a criminal action. The UGTT stated that it \u201cwarned young protesters against carrying out night-time demonstrations, when there is a risk that they may be infiltrated, and denounced acts of vandalism and acts of pillage of public and private property committed over the recent days.\u201d<\/p> <p>Yesterday, Interior Ministry spokesman Khaled Hayouni announced the arrest of 632 people, mainly aged between 15 and 25. Largely echoing the rhetoric of the UGTT, he denounced the protests: \u201cThis has nothing to do with movements with demands, which are protected by the Constitution. Such movements normally take place during the day and do not include criminal actions.\u201d<\/p> <p>Demonstrations continued yesterday in dozens of cities across Tunisia, defying the army\u2019s threats and waves of arrests by the regime. In Tunis, one protest march headed down Habib Bourguiba Avenue, which was the site of mass protests during the uprising against Ben Ali in 2011. The protesters shouted slogans such as \u201cNo fear, no horror, power belongs to the people!\u201d<\/p> <p>Press dispatches indicated large-scale clashes with police in several cities and working-class suburbs of Tunis. Police fired tear gas in large quantities against demonstrators, who retaliated by throwing stones and shooting fireworks at the security forces, often from the tops of tall apartment blocks.<\/p> <p>These protests make clear that the political struggle launched by the overthrow of Ben Ali by the working class a decade ago continues to this day. None of the demands for greater social equality and for democratic rights that drove the uprising of the workers and youth in January 2011 have been granted.<\/p> <p>The course of events fully vindicated the January 17, 2011, statement published by the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI), titled \u201cThe mass uprising in Tunisia and the perspective of permanent revolution.\u201d The ICFI declared that the uprising marked \u201ca turning point in world affairs\u201d and opened \u201ca new era of revolutionary upheavals.\u201d It pointed to the international class tensions that had driven the uprising and the role of WikiLeaks\u2019 revelations of Ben Ali\u2019s corruption in spurring on the revolt.<\/p> <p>The ICFI also stressed the urgency of creating an international Trotskyist revolutionary vanguard in the working class across the Middle East and North Africa, fighting for the perspective of the overthrow of capitalism and an international socialist revolution:<\/p> <p>Weak and dependent, tied by innumerable threads to foreign imperialism and native feudalist forces, the bourgeoisie of countries such as Tunisia is a thousand times more fearful of and hostile to the revolutionary force of the working class than it is to imperialism. \u2026 Without the development of a revolutionary leadership, another authoritarian regime will inevitably be installed to replace that of Ben Ali.<\/p> <p>The Tunisian uprising was followed by a powerful revolutionary upsurge of the Egyptian working class that toppled Hosni Mubarak, as well as various protests across the region. However, insofar as petty-bourgeois groups like the Revolutionary Socialist (RS) in Egypt and the Popular Front in Tunisia blocked a seizure of power by the working class, the regime stabilized itself. The imperialist powers launched a wave of wars in Libya, Syria, Ivory Coast and Mali. The Tunisian governments that followed Ben Ali were barely disguised tools of international banks and lending agencies.<\/p> <p>The government of Mechichi\u2014a former interior minister who still occupies that position, though ostensibly on an interim basis\u2014is based on an unstable coalition of Islamists, liberals and former Ben Ali supporters. Perpetually teetering on the verge of state bankruptcy, it is threatened with strangulation by the major banks and is incapable of offering jobs, decent social conditions and democratic rights to the working class.<\/p> <p>The pandemic and official \u201cherd immunity\u201d policies, which in Tunisia have claimed 5,570 lives and vastly intensified the social and economic crisis in the country, have exposed the bankruptcy of the social order not only in North Africa, but in Europe, North America and worldwide. It is widely sensed that the protests now unfolding in Tunisia are part of a global crisis with revolutionary implications triggered by the pandemic.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe social, economic and health situation created by the COVID-19 crisis is favorable to such demonstrations,\u201d journalist Fateen Hafsia told the Arabic edition of the British Independent. He added: \u201cJanuary in Tunisia generally has been the historic motor of protests, from the 1952 revolution [against French colonial rule] to the 1978 confrontation with the UGTT and the events of January 2011 and the toppling of Ben Ali.\u201d<\/p> <p>The January 6, 2021, fascist coup attempted by Donald Trump on the Capitol in Washington, D.C., is a further warning to workers not only in America, but around the world. Capitalism, rotting on its feet, undermines democracy even in the wealthiest and most powerful countries with the longest democratic traditions. For the working class around the world, the struggle to establish and defend democratic rights is today directly tied to an international struggle of the working class for socialism.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3HEA4ZVWVF1UL2V9CSZ9JHHXI06559"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":627,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"01","date":"14.0","city":"Tunis","region":"None","country":"Tunisia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Tunisia, uprising, revolt, protesters","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"01","date":"14.0","city":"Tunis","region":"None","country":"Tunisia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Tunisia, uprising, revolt, protesters","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":946357648,"Input.title":"Release Two Dozen Human Rights Activists from Illegal Detainment","Input.publish_date":"2020-09-13 17:39:45","Input.article_interface":"<p>Target: Hun Sen, Prime Minister of Cambodia<\/p> <p>Goal: Release two dozen human rights and environmental activists held in detainment by Cambodian officials.<\/p> <p>Over two dozen human rights and environmental activists are held in illegal detainment by the Cambodian government.

We believe that we are on our own; therefore, we are the ones to make sure that we get our loved ones out. \u201cNo one really trusts government or law enforcement agencies to be on top of the situation.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen government says it is not going to negotiate with criminals and that nobody should negotiate, then, we have to also believe that something is being done on the other hand.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf government is telling us not to pay, then, they should also tell us what active plans, and not just talking, we must see the active steps it is taking to actually protect the citizens.\u201d<\/p> <p>She advised government to start building trust among the people, put up a response unit, provide a dedicated hotline for kidnap cases, and assign professionals to victims\u2019 families to help them during the traumatic period.<\/p> <p>Nigerians buy favour \u2014Ononugbo<\/p> <p>In his contribution, Mr. Alfred Ononugbo, a forensic expert and criminal intelligence specialist, said Nigeria\u2019s security infrastructure has been weakened by indiscipline, corruption, unprofessionalism, incompetence and lack of patriotism.<\/p> <p>According to him, a situation whereby \u201ccitizens freely engaging criminals shows that there is a break in the bridge.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt starts with buying of voter\u2019s card to buying power, and now, we are buying the favour of criminals.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe make criminals see themselves as entrepreneurs and that is very dangerous for our society.\u201d<\/p> <p>To arrest the ugly trend, Ononugbo, a security consultant and private crimes investigator, suggested rejigging of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture.<\/p> <p>The analyst said: \u201cWe must rejig the security infrastructure, we must look at the curriculum and we must also look at the selection process.<\/p> <p>\u201cPart of why we are in this mess is that we entrusted our security in the hands of politicians who recruit security agents based on quota, and not on merit or credibility.\u201d<\/p> <p>It\u2019s an extortionate terrorism \u2014CISLAC boss, Hashim<\/p> <p>Also, the Program Manager, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, Sacandeen Hashim, described what the country is experiencing as an \u2018extortionate terrorism\u2019.<\/p> <p>According to him, it would be difficult to stop payment of ransom to bandits because some unscrupulous elements in government circle were using negotiation and payment of ransom as a cover to divert public funds.<\/p> <p>Hashim said: \u201cWe have noticed a new avenue for massive diversion of public funds to escape accountability.<\/p> <p>\u201cPolitical fat cats access funds in the false impression of paying ransom to bandits in the bush that are kept and sustained for this game called banditry.<\/p> <p>Carrot and stick<\/p> <p>\u201cHowever, to end strife, there are often two positions. You either beat the enemy to pulp, pulverize and blow him away. Or you negotiate.<\/p> <p>\u201cNegotiation is done everywhere in the world, but when it becomes a tool for corruption and financing terrorism and political establishment, then, it becomes extortion.<\/p> <p>\u201cGovernment should apply carrot and stick to save the situation and avoid fatalities of those in captivity.<\/p> <p>Professional negotiators<\/p> <p>\u201cThe institutions of the state are weak. We do not even have professional negotiators. \u201cThe example of Zamfara and Katsina is a classical example of failed negotiations.<\/p> <p>\u201cA government should have a team of experts handling the situation with concrete prohibition for operation in specific boundaries.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe must think outside the box because, we cannot continue to do same thing and expect a different result.\u201d<\/p> <p>No alternative to paying ransom \u2014Onovo<\/p> <p>Chief Martin Onovo, a political analyst and former presidential candidate, added that Nigerians pay ransom due to compelling cultural, strategic and logical reasons.<\/p> <p>He explained that the principal reason for kidnapping was ransom, adding that in some cases, victims were kidnapped for labour or sex slavery.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe bandits that kidnap have crime as the source of their funds. They have killed many of their victims and may kill those that fail to attract ransoms. Some victims have become sick in captivity and died\u201d, he said. \u201cConsidering the danger victims face, friends and family members are desperate to have their kidnapped loved ones home safely. Consequently, they raise the funds required for ransom.<\/p> <p>No choice<\/p> <p>\u201cIn normal circumstances, Nigerians will not pay any ransom to kidnappers, but with the failure of the Buhari\u2019s administration, and the incompetence and corruption in our security establishment, Nigerians see no alternatives.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf Nigerians believe that our security forces can rescue their kidnapped relations, they will most definitely not pay ransom. \u201cNigerians pay ransom because they know that their government and security forces will not rescue them if kidnapped. Nigerians have no choice but to pay the ransoms or risked being killed.\u201d<\/p> <p>Timeline of kidnap cases in July, and ransom demanded by abductors<\/p> <p>July 1, 2021: Armed robbers kill police officer in attempted bank robbery in Ekiti<\/p> <p>July 3, 2021: Bandits abduct 7 women, 4 children along Birnin Gwari Road, demand N25m ransom<\/p> <p>July 5-6, 2021: Suspected bandits kill 19 in overnight attack on Tsauwa village, Katsina State<\/p> <p>July 5, 2021: Boko Haram abducts Rev.

A 2018 opinion poll by Twaweza, a Tanzanian pollster, found that the Tanzanian president\u2019s popularity had declined sharply in two years, from 96% when he was elected in 2016, to 71% in 2017 and 55% in 2018.<\/p> <p>The Tanzanian government, predictably in the Magufuli-era, threatened to take \u201cappropriate action\u201d against the pollster.<\/p> <p>Tanzania and Zanzibar\u2019s presidential, parliamentary and local elections are due on 4 October.<\/p> <p>READ: Analysis on Tanzania by Kurt Davis Jr. in Top African elections to watch and predictions for 2020<\/p> <p>Somalia<\/p> <p>Somalia\u2019s 2020 elections, due in December, are probably the most important in East Africa and the Horn in 2020.<\/p> <p>Not only is Somalia holding its first universal suffrage elections in five decades, but it is also the epicentre of Islamic militant activity in the region, regional and Gulf State competition, and a primary target of US Africa Command (Africom) anti-terror operations. In 2019, Africom conducted at least 60 airstrikes targeting Al-Shabaab and ISIS-Somalia militants.<\/p> <p>In 2019, Al-Shabaab militants repeatedly attacked targets in the capital, Mogadishu, killing hundreds and maiming thousands more. The Al-Qaeda group has carried on the attacks in 2020 \u2013at some point during the writing of this article, for example, a car bomb exploded near the country\u2019s parliament, killing at least four people and wounding at least 10.<\/p> <p>One suicide truck attack at a police checkpoint on 28 December, 2019, left more than 85 people dead and 140 injured. The militant group said the target was \u201can enemy Turkish convoy and the militias who were guarding them\u201d. Only two of the casualties were Turkish citizens.<\/p> <p>Somalia\u2019s intelligence agency said that a \u201cforeign country\u201d was behind the attack targeting Turkish interests. While it did not name the suspect country, it is clear that Somalia\u2019s 2020 elections will be subject to multiple, competing interests of other states, both in the region and in the Middle East especially.<\/p> <p>The UAE-Saudi Arabia versus Turkey-Qatar cold war has played out in Somalia\u2019s fractured political and economic systems, with each side investing, and actively sabotaging, the other\u2019s plans.<\/p> <p>President Mohamed Farmajo\u2019s non-aligned stance might have made it easier to navigate the ongoing blockade of Qatar, but it has also raised the risk that the rising political temperatures due to the election could play out as proxy wars by Gulf countries, and Somalia\u2019s neighbours.<\/p> <p>Farmajo\u2019s government is also engaged in a long-running maritime border dispute with neighbouring Kenya, which has troops in the Horn of Africa nation and is the second most-attacked country by Al-Shabaab militants after Somalia.<\/p> <p>At home, President Farmajo\u2019s long-running attempt to centralise the government has not won him many allies. Ahmed Madobe\u2019s re-election in Jubaland last August, epitomised the divide between (some) federal states and Mogadishu, as well as the competing external interests in Somalia\u2019s political leadership.<\/p> <p>A land border dispute between Somaliland and Puntland, both self-governing regions of Somalia, also remains unsolved. The dispute led to armed conflict in early 2018, and the risk of it flaring up again in an election year is not far-fetched.<\/p> <p>For Farmajo, the next few months will be crucial because he has a lot to do to break Somalia\u2019s one-term presidency jinx. While he has many friends, he also has enemies both at home and abroad, who view his presence as destabilising the region, Mogadishu\u2019s uneasy peace with federal states, and the progress in the war against Al-Shabaab.<\/p> <p>For the United States and Kenya, stability in Mogadishu is crucial to the war against the militants, who struck the former\u2019s \u2018Camp Simba\u2019 in the latter\u2019s southern region of Lamu earlier this month.<\/p> <p>There\u2019s also a real risk that the ongoing conflict between the US and Iran in Iraq may play out in East Africa via the Horn, where they both have interests as well as proxy partners. In October 2018, Reuters reported that UN investigators had traced illicit Somali charcoal exports, which are one of Al-Shabaab\u2019s most crucial sources of revenue, to routes through Iran.<\/p> <p>The comprehensive UN report traced similar threads of arms trafficking, this time involving Yemen, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other countries.<\/p> <p>In brief:<\/p> <p>Election years tend to raise political temperatures anywhere in the world, but in East African countries scheduled to hold elections this year, there are many, competing interests and issues that may play defining roles. Underneath, and perhaps playing a large part of the current political climates, the four countries are struggling with the same socio-economic challenge: majority young, unemployed populations.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"34ZTTGSNJZ3VUHY2XMOL6PFEJ5KHQF"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":797,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2019.0","month":"12","date":"28.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, attacks","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2019.0","month":"12","date":"28.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, attacks","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":915514418,"Input.title":"Shadow Report to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in Response to the 6th Periodic Report of Cameroon","Input.publish_date":"2020-03-30 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Introduction<\/p> <p>During its 66th Ordinary Session, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR) will consider the 6th Periodic Report of Cameroon pertaining to the implementation of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the Maputo Protocol, and the Kampala Convention. Human Rights Watch welcomes the submission of this state report and in conformity with Rules 74 and 75 of the Rules of Procedure of the ACHPR, Human Rights Watch (Observer Status number 17) submits this shadow report. This report includes findings from Human Rights Watch research into the human rights situation of Cameroon. The report covers violations of the right to life (article 4); the right to equal protection under the law (article 3); arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and other ill treatments (article 5 and 6); and violations of freedom of speech and assembly (article 9, 10 & 11).<\/p> <p>Background: Crisis in the Anglophone Regions<\/p> <p>The Anglophone North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon have been embroiled in a deepening human rights and humanitarian crisis since late October 2016, when teachers, lawyers, students, and activists, who had long complained of what they perceive to be marginalization of the two regions by the central government, took to the streets to demand more recognition of their political, social, and cultural rights. Government forces have responded by violently cracking down on peaceful protests, arbitrarily arresting local activists and peaceful protesters, curtailing the activities of civil society, and blocking access to the internet. Armed separatists have also killed, tortured, and kidnapped dozens of civilians, including teachers, students, and government officials.The crisis has led to the displacement of over 679,000 people, deprived more than 600,000 children from schooling in the two Anglophone regions, and claimed more than 3,000 lives.<\/p> <p>On September 10, amid increasing violence and following sustained international pressure, President Biya called for a \u201cnational dialogue,\u201d a series of nationwide discussions aimed at addressing the crisis. The dialogue ended with the adoption of a special status for the two Anglophone regions and the release of hundreds of political prisoners, including Maurice Kamto, leader of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) opposition party, and other persons arrested in connection with the unrest in the North-West and South-West regions.<\/p> <p>Abuses by armed separatists<\/p> <p>Armed separatists demanding the secession of the North-West and South-West regions from the Cameroonian state have killed, tortured, and kidnapped hundreds of civilians, including teachers, students, clergy, members and supporters of political parties, and government officials. Human Rights Watch has documented hundreds of cases of kidnapping of civilians by armed separatists. Most of the abductees were released after a ransom was paid.<\/p> <p>Since early 2017, separatists have consistently targeted school buildings and threatened education officials and students with violence if they did not comply with separatist demands to boycott schools. They have also used schools as bases, deploying fighters and weapons in and near them, including in Koppin village (Mezam division), Tenkha village (Ngoketunjia division), and Mbuluf (Bui division), Bali (Mezam division).<\/p> <p>In one case, on February 16, a group of armed separatists abducted 170 students, mostly girls under 18, a teacher, and two guards from a boarding school in Kumbo, North-West region. They were all released the following day amid rumors of ransoms being paid..<\/p> <p>On June 18, separatists kidnapped at least 40 people, including women and children, beat and robbed them in Bafut, North-West region. They were released the following day.<\/p> <p>On June 28, armed separatists beat and kidnapped John Fru Ndi, a well-known Cameroonian politician, from his home in Bamenda, North-West region. Three days before, armed separatists abducted and released another high-profile figure, Cornelius Fontem Esua, the archbishop of Bamenda.<\/p> <p>In November, members of the Restoration Forces armed separatist group kidnapped 20 candidates for the February 9, 2020 municipal elections in the town of Jakiri, North-West region. The officials were held in a small house near a separatist camp in Vekovi village. They were released on December 8, after ransom payments believed to range between the amounts of 250,000 and 500,000 CFA ($419-$838) were paid for each abductee.<\/p> <p>On January 5, 2020, armed separatists from the Restoration Forces group led by a commander known as \u201cGeneral Man Pass Man\u201d kidnapped the mayor of Babessi, North-West region, along with four council members in Babessi. The Restoration Forces released them on January 22, following a ransom payment of 1,000,000 CFA (US$1,678). The separatists had also kidnapped and tortured the Babessi mayor in June 2019.<\/p> <p>Violations of Freedom of Assembly and Arbitrary Arrest and Detention of Opposition Members and Supporters (Articles 9, 10 &11)<\/p> <p>Throughout 2019 Cameroonian authorities and security forces arrested hundreds of members and supporters of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) opposition party and violently dispersed peaceful protests.<\/p> <p>In late January 2019, CRM leader Maurice Kamto was arbitrarily arrested along with over 200 members and supporters of his party, including his closest advisors. Security forces fired teargas into the crowd and rubber bullets from close range to disperse protesters.<\/p> <p>Kamto and other CRM leaders were unable to meet their lawyers for several days and were later charged before a military court with a number of offenses including hostility against the homeland, threats to public order and rebellion. Those charges appeared to be politically motivated.<\/p> <p>In June 2019, at least 350 CRM members and supporters were arbitrarily arrested after they attempted to hold demonstrations across the country.<\/p> <p>Almost all CRM members and supporters, including Kamto, were released on October 5, following a Presidential decree. Sixteen of them, however, including Mamadou Yacouba, CRM Vice President, remain in detention as of February 2020.<\/p> <p>Issues not addressed in the 6th Periodic Report:<\/p> <p>Cameroon\u2019s 6th Periodic Report (the Report) does not mention the arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition members or of the violent dispersal of demonstrators by members of the security forces. It also does not describe any measures taken by the Government of Cameroon to mitigate violations of freedom of assembly and public demonstration. The Report states instead that \u201cfreedom of assembly and public demonstration is guaranteed by Law No. 90\/55.\u201d However, the government of Cameroon failed to uphold those freedoms for opposition members arrested during and following peaceful demonstrations, as documented by Human Rights Watch.<\/p> <p>The arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds of opposition members and supporters and the subsequent impediment of their access to legal assistance is contrary to Cameroon\u2019s own laws pertaining to freedom of assembly and its obligations as a state party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. It also reflects a climate of rapidly shrinking political and civic space.<\/p> <p>Suggested questions for the ACHPR to pose to the delegation from the government of Cameroon:<\/p> <p>Could you please provide a response to allegations of torture documented in an August 2019 report by Human Rights Watch including the incommunicado detention and torture in detention of more than 100 detainees in the State Defense Secretariat (SED) between July 23 -August 4, 2019 in Yaound\u00e9? Has the government initiated any investigations into allegations of abuse and torture in detention by security forces, including the following: The enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention of 26 individuals between January 2018 and January 2019 in the SED detention site The torture of 14 individuals between January 2018 and January 2019 in the SED detention site. The alleged systematic use of torture to extract confessions from detainees in the SED detention site. Has the government initiated any investigations into allegations of abuses by security forces in the context of counter-insurgency operations in the North-West and South-West regions, including: The destruction of property in the North-West and South-West regions between November 2018 and January 2020, including the burning of more than 60 homes in Abuh village in November 2018. Alleged unlawful killings of civilians by security forces in the North-West and South-West regions since November 2018. Have there been any prosecutions, convictions or disciplinary actions taken against officials or security force members involved in the human rights violations described in the August 2019 Human Rights Watch report? If so, could you provide detailed information about the number of cases, the nature of the crimes, the actions taken, and the status of the cases? Has the government taken any concrete measures to mitigate further abuses by security forces? If so, could you please provide any details and documentation of these measures?<\/p> <p>Recommendations:<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:<\/p> <p>Immediately end the practice of arbitrary arrests and detention of civilians, including opposition members and supporters, for exercising their freedom of expression and assembly.<\/p> <p>Immediately put an end to the use of military courts to try civilians.<\/p> <p>Ensure that security forces deployed to protests with the purpose of protecting public order are trained to respect human rights during their operations and refrain from using excessive force.<\/p> <p>Monitor failures to implement domestic laws and policies related to freedom of expression and assembly.<\/p> <p>Thoroughly investigate all allegations of excessive use of force by members of the security forces during protests, regardless of victims\u2019 political affiliation, and ensure that those implicated in abuses are adequately disciplined.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Violations by Government Forces<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch\u2019s research shows how human rights violations by government forces have been rife since the crisis in the Anglophone regions began in late 2016. Security forces have killed civilians, burned dozens of villages, and arbitrarily arrested and tortured hundreds of alleged armed separatists.<\/p> <p>Destruction of property (article 14)<\/p> <p>In one case, security forces burned down more than 60 homes in Abuh village, North-West region, in a three-day security operation carried out in November 2018. Human Rights Watch has confirmed the burning through satellite imagery.<\/p> <p>On November 22, 2018 gendarmes burned at least 13 houses in Bali village, North-West region.<\/p> <p>Between December 3 and 6, 2018, following clashes between the military and armed separatists, security forces burned over 55 houses in areas of Kumbo known as SAC Junction and Romajay, as well as in Meluf, Kikaikom, and Nyaro, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning of houses through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses\u2019 accounts.<\/p> <p>On May 15, 2019, following the killing of two Air Force soldiers by suspected armed separatists, security forces burned over 70 homes in Mankon, Bamenda, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses\u2019 accounts.<\/p> <p>Between January 17 and 20, 2020, security forces searching for armed separatists burned down over 50 homes in Bali, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses\u2019 accounts.<\/p> <p>Unlawful killings (articles 4 & 5)<\/p> <p>On October 21, 2018 soldiers and gendarmes attacked Rom and Nsah villages and unlawfully killed at least four civilians, including a young man with a physical disability.<\/p> <p>On December 5, 2018 the army unlawfully killed seven people in Meluf village, North-West region, including a 70-year-old man with a hearing impairment who was burned inside his neighbor\u2019s home.<\/p> <p>On January 18, 2019 soldiers unlawfully killed a 28-year-old nurse who was seven months pregnant, while she was on her way to work in Kumbo, North-West region.<\/p> <p>On February 6, 2019 soldiers from the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) stormed the market of Bole Bakundu village, South-West region, and unlawfully killed up to 10 men. Community members said they believed that security forces were retaliating against civilians accused of collaborating with the separatists.<\/p> <p>On April 4, 2019, Cameroonian soldiers, gendarmes, and members of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) carried out a deadly attack on the North-West region village of Meluf. They unlawfully killed five civilian men, including one with a mental disability. Three of the bodies were later found mutilated, including one that had been decapitated.<\/p> <p>On May 15, 2019, following the killing of two Air Force soldiers by suspected armed separatists, security forces unlawfully killed a 41-year-old man in Alachu, Bamenda, North-West region.<\/p> <p>On July 10, 2019, soldiers from the Cameroonian Air Force, unlawfully killed a 20-year-old man with a mental disability, and another civilian, during security operations searching for armed separatists in Alachu neighborhood of the city of Bamenda, north-West region.<\/p> <p>Soldiers, including members of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), and gendarmes unlawfully killed at least 4 civilians, including two men with intellectual disabilities, in a security operation in Bali village between January 17- 20, 2020.<\/p> <p>Torture and incommunicado detention (articles 3, 5, & 6)<\/p> <p>The Government of Cameroon publicly declared in 2017 that torture does not take place in Cameroon, however Human Rights Watch continues to receive reports of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment in detention. Cameroon\u2019s Periodic Report fails to demonstrate any progress on investigating the use of torture in detention and does not provide any evidence of cases brought before courts to hold to account security force members implicated in torture or ill-treatment in detention since 2017.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch documented 26 cases of incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance and 14 cases of torture at the State Defense Secretariat (Secretariat d\u2019Etat a la defense, SED) in Yaound\u00e9 between January 2018 and January 2019. Between July 23 and August 4, 2019 Cameroonian authorities held more than 100 people in incommunicado detention and tortured many of them in the SED prison in Yaound\u00e9. Former detainees described low- to mid-ranking gendarmes using methods of torture, including severe beatings and near drownings, to humiliate, punish, and extract confessions from detainees, most of whom were civilians detained for suspected ties to armed separatist groups.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch also documented that Cameroonian authorities held over 100 detainees in incommunicado detention and tortured many of them in SED, Yaound\u00e9, from July 23 to August 4, 2019. The detainees were transferred to the facility the morning after inmates in Yaound\u00e9\u2019s Central Prison rioted on July 22 in protest against overcrowding, dire living conditions, and delays in their cases getting to trial. The whereabouts of the majority of the detainees was unknown for almost two weeks. On August 3, 2019 the day after official acknowledgement of the whereabouts of the detainees, some lawyers were finally able to meet with some of their clients at the SED. Human Rights Watch interviewed 14 detainees held at the SED, all of whom said they were tortured and held incommunicado during their time there, and heard credible accounts that scores more were also tortured.<\/p> <p>Sexual violence (articles 3 & 4, Maputo Protocol)<\/p> <p>Cameroon\u2019s 6th Periodic Report states that \u201cfrom 2013 to 2017, 313 elements of Defence (sic) Forces were prosecuted before the courts for different offences,\u201d including rape and attempted rape, and notes that 30 of the 313 were convicted and sentenced. The Report however fails to provide evidence of any efforts on the part of the Government of Cameroon to prosecute those implicated in human rights violations, including sexual violence, committed in the Anglophone regions since late 2017, or any details of cases brought against security forces which were tried before courts.<\/p> <p>The Report states that Sections 295 and 296 of the Penal Code introduced new penalties for offences of rape and Sections 346 and 347 include punishments for \u201coffences on minors accompanied by sexual intercourse or rape.\u201d The Report affirms that 264 cases of rape were prosecuted in 2016 and 309 were prosecuted in 2017, however the Report fails to provide evidence of any investigations or prosecutions of cases of sexual violence. Human Rights Watch documented four cases of sexual violence by security force members. Two women and one girl from a locality in the North-West region each said that BIR soldiers raped them in January 2019. In another case in June 2019, a soldier reportedly raped a woman in Kumbo, North-West region. Human Rights Watch spoke to aid workers in the North-West and South-West regions who expressed concerns that there are many more cases of sexual violence by security forces which go unreported due to survivors\u2019 fear of social stigma.<\/p> <p>Recommendations:<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:<\/p> <p>Take steps, in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the Maputo Protocol, to guarantee the life, dignity, integrity and security of civilians, including specific measures to protect women and girls and to mitigate the risk of sexual violence.<\/p> <p>Direct local authorities, including law enforcement officials members of the security forces, to protect civilians, including women, girls, and children, in the Anglophone regions from the threat of kidnapping and hold to account authorities who fail in their duties to uphold the safety and security of all civilians, regardless of gender and ethno-linguistic identity.<\/p> <p>Initiate prompt, independent, and impartial investigations into allegations of rape and sexual and gender-based violence by armed separatists and security forces with the aim of bringing perpetrators to justice.<\/p> <p>Ensure adequate health and psychosocial services, including comprehensive post-rape medical care, are available to survivors of sexual violence by security forces.<\/p> <p>Conclusion<\/p> <p>Cameroon has submitted 6 reports in the last 18 years. Cameroon\u2019s 6th periodic report fails to provide any comprehensive account of efforts to mitigate further abuses by security forces against civilians and to ensure that military operations are conducted with respect for human rights. The Report only claims that the International School for Security Forces (EIFORCES) offers a two-week course on human rights and protection of vulnerable persons. The course, albeit useful, can hardly address the urgent need for the government to effectively enforce respect for human rights by security forces and accountability for those who fail to do so. Human Rights Watch continues to document cases of serious abuses by Cameroonian security forces, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, the burning of hundreds of homes, torture and incommunicado detention.These abuses should be addressed by holding the perpetrators to account.<\/p> <p>Final Recommendations:<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3X0EMNLXER4FC6S72YQ0LLGDMRAPVT"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":941,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2013.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cameroon","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maurice Kamto","victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement leader, arrested, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement members, political prisoner, arrested","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"students, kidnapped, hostage, civillian, torture, separatists","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"women, girls, rape, torture, state soldiers","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"killings, Rom and Nsah, Meluf, Kumbo, Bole Bakundu, Alachu, Bali village","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2013.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cameroon","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maurice Kamto","victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement leader, arrested, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement members, political prisoner, arrested","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"students, kidnapped, hostage, civillian, torture, separatists","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"women, girls, rape, torture, state soldiers","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"killings, Rom and Nsah, Meluf, Kumbo, Bole Bakundu, Alachu, Bali village","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1002703867,"Input.title":"Why Celebrate Labor Day","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>There is much confusion over why the United States of America and Canada commemorate Labor Day on the first Monday in September and not as many other nations do, on the first of May.<\/p> <p>For some workers unaware of the history, Labor Day is perceived as a tactic to counteract the militant international working-class spirit of May Day and becoming a symbol of workers\u2019 docility, of collaboration with the bosses, of everything that weakens. It is a day associated with BBQs, picnics and shopping at the mall. However, Labor Day is a celebration of America\u2019s and Canada\u2019s labor movement. That\u2019s easy to forget these days.<\/p> <p>Labor Day took its inspiration from a strike for the 8 hour day held in Toronto in the 1870s and was adopted by American workers, four years before the momentous events of 1886 that initiated May Day. So both Labor Day and May Day share common origins in the campaign for \u201c8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest and 8 hours for what we will\u201d as the song went.<\/p> <p>So both Mayday and Labor Day should be reminders of the need for working people to try and capture the good things in life and advance working peoples\u2019 well-being. Labor Day also came about because workers felt they were spending too many hours and days on the job. In the 1830s, manufacturing workers were putting in 70-hour weeks on average. Sixty years later, in 1890, hours of work had dropped, although the average manufacturing worker still toiled in a factory 60 hours a week. These long working hours caused many union organizers to focus on winning a shorter eight-hour workday. They also focused on getting workers more days off, such as the Labor Day holiday, and reducing the working week to just six days. Labor unions are still finding ways to wield their organizing influence and help fellow workers.<\/p> <p>The World Socialist Movement tries to explain the lessons of the first Mayday and Labor Day is that the capitalists need us, we do not need them. \u201cLabor creates all wealth, All wealth belongs to labor\u201d. Our fellow workers need to learn and understand the truth of that statement.<\/p> <p>In capitalism, the rich always grow richer and all workers can do within capitalism is slow that process down. What is needed is the entire edifice, the whole system \u2013 wages, profits, markets requires abolishing and only then can we make decisions to free ourselves and the world.<\/p> <p>Canadians will, of course, be fully aware that their Labor Day origins can be traced back to an 1872 printers strike in Toronto when a parade was staged in support of the Toronto Typographical Union\u2019s strike for a 58-hour work-week. Police arrested 24 leaders of the Typographical Union. Labour leaders decided to call for a demonstration on September 3 to protest the arrests. The Toronto Trades and Labour Council began to hold similar celebrations every spring. American Peter J. McGuire, the co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, was asked to speak at a labour festival in Toronto, Canada on July 22, 1882. Returning to the United States, McGuire and the Knights of Labor organised a similar parade based on the Canadian event on September 5, 1882.<\/p> <p>In the 1800s, unions covered only a small fraction of workers and were relatively weak. The goal of organizations like the Central Labor Union and more modern-day counterparts was to bring many small unions together to become more powerful. The organizers of the first Labor Day were interested in creating an event that brought different types of workers together to meet each other and recognize their common interests. Unions increase the bargaining power of workers, which translates into higher earnings and a stronger voice for employees.<\/p> <p>But like so many workers\u2019 initiatives, Labor Day was co-opted by the government and by the employers. It became a federal holiday in 1894, when, following the murder of workers during the Pullman Strike, in an attempt to appease the nation\u2019s workers, President Grover Cleveland fearing further conflict, rushed legislation through Congress to designate the first Monday in September Labor Day. The Cleveland Administration believed it would act as a counterweight to May Day, the international day of labor solidarity adopted by the First Congress of the Second Socialist International in 1889 to commemorate the Haymarket Massacre in Chicago in 1886 so from its outset Labor Day symbolized the official American labor movement\u2019s commitment to a more moderate form of politics! May Day emphasized the fact that the working class had to fight for its right to organize and for all the gains it had won in wages, hours and conditions of work. It was to counteract the militant working-class spirit of its marching legions on May Day that the government set aside the first Monday in September as a labor holiday. The American Labor Day holiday came as a \u201cgift\u201d that the workers received from their masters, through their servile politicians.<\/p> <p>Labor Day must not become a symbol of workers\u2019 docility, of collaboration with the bosses, of everything that weakens and hurts the working class. It cannot be a day when politicians and employers advertise and promote themselves. Every shrewd politician will pose as a \u201cfriend of labor\u201d, shaking hands and jovially slapping the labor union leaders on the back (later to stab them in the back), seeking to secure their endorsement and election donations with a lot of empty promises and false hopes before setting off the legislatures on the labor vote, promptly forgetting the pledges until next election rolls around.<\/p> <p>The reformists have kept socialist politics out of the trade union movement, while capitalist politics have run amok undoing the strength of the unions.<\/p> <p>Many working people now vote against their economic interests. Unions have donated more than millions to pro-business politicians.<\/p> <p>\u201cUnions fail partly from the injudicious use of their powers,\u201d wrote Marx. The World Socialist Movement does not shy away from warning our fellow workers what pitfalls are in store for them if they persist in giving their time, money and votes to parties that can only work in the interests of their masters. It is time that cash was directed at more worthwhile causes such as organizing the non-unionized.<\/p> <p>On Labor Day we must expose that great falsehood the slogan of \u201ca fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work.\u201d Since wages imply exploitation and represent but a minor fraction of the total product of labor, it is self-evident that wages can never be fair. Wages grow out of a system of unfairness, of robbery. Accordingly, for labor to acknowledge that there is such a thing as a \u201cfair wage\u201d is to kowtow to the principle of exploitation, to kiss the hand that robs it and impresses on the mind of labor the \u201cduty\u201d to deliver its goods\u2014its ability to produce\u2014to the master joyfully and to the fullest capacity. It puts on the worker, by his own consent, the brand of the slave.<\/p> <p>The history of the North American movement is rich in the tradition of the importance of unions to workers. The struggles waged and the gains won by workers demonstrate what can be achieved through organizing on the economic field. We have the unions to thank for a lot of things we take for granted: the eight-hour workday, child labor laws, health and safety standards and the weekend. And studies show that a large union presence in an industry or region can raise wages even for non-union workers. But as weak and ineffectual as the labor movement is today, it is still a potential threat.<\/p> <p>The history of the labor movement proves the Marxian contention that wages are not regulated by any \u201ciron law\u201d but can be modified by organized militant action on the part of the workers. The necessity of native-born and foreign workers; black, hispanic and white, to march together on picket lines, to work together in strike committees and hold out together until their demands are won \u2013 all this constitutes an object lesson in class solidarity that American and Canadian workers must learn and practice.<\/p> <p>It is time that Labor Day 2021 brings home the point: There is a need for a change in our society. Socialism is a necessity. It would destroy the capitalist system wherein one class is enriched by exploiting the majority. We need socialism because the means of life, the factories, mines, transport, communications and land should belong to the people! We need socialism because the production of the necessities of life would be for the use of the people instead of the profit of a few. The capitalist world heaps misery upon misery upon the backs of the toilers. Capitalism remains what it has been from birth: a system of exploitation of the many for the enrichment of the few. Labor Day should remind us of the urgency to move towards socialism. The capitalist world heaps misery upon misery upon the backs of the toilers. Capitalism remains what it has been from birth: a system of exploitation of the many for the enrichment of the few. Labor Day should remind us of the urgency to move towards socialism.<\/p> <p>We are all one\u2014all workers of all lands and climes. We know not color, nor creed, nor gender in the workers\u2019 movement. We know only that that with the solidarity of labor, we will vanquish wage-slavery and humanize the World. But when all is said and done, the workers won\u2019t get much from this annual love-fest of Labor Day messages and speeches. Government is dismissive at all levels to the interests of the working class. The monied alone are served. The only solution is a revolutionary change.<\/p> <p>As you enjoy this holiday do well to remember that it was paid for by union sweat and on occasions in union blood.<\/p> <p>The Socialist Party of Canada and the World Socialist Party of the United States on this Labor Day sounds forth the historic battle-cry of the Marx and the World Socialist Movement:<\/p> <p>\u201cWorkers of the world, unite!

U.S. military officers told Amnesty International that the U.S. assault on Raqqa in Syria was also the heaviest artillery bombardment since the Vietnam War.<\/p> <p>Mosul in Iraq was the largest city that the United States and its allies reduced to rubble in that campaign, with a pre-assault population of 1.5 million. About 138,000 houses were damaged or destroyed by bombing and artillery, and an Iraqi Kurdish intelligence report counted at least 40,000 civilians killed.<\/p> <p>Raqqa, which had a population of 300,000, was gutted even more. A U.N. assessment mission reported that 70 percent to 80 percent of buildings were destroyed or damaged. Syrian and Kurdish forces in Raqqa reported counting 4,118 civilian bodies. Many more deaths remain uncounted in the rubble of Mosul and Raqqa. Without comprehensive mortality surveys, we may never know what fraction of the actual death toll these numbers represent.<\/p> <p>Rand Corporation Review<\/p> <p>The Pentagon promised to review its policies on civilian casualties in the wake of these massacres, and commissioned the Rand Corporation to conduct a study titled, \u201cUnderstanding Civilian Harm in Raqqa and Its Implications For Future Conflicts,\u201d which has now been made public.<\/p> <p>Even as the world recoils from the shocking violence in Ukraine, the premise of the Rand Corp study is that U.S. forces will continue to wage wars that involve devastating bombardments of cities and populated areas, and that they must therefore try to understand how they can do so without killing quite so many civilians.<\/p> <p>The study runs over 100 pages, but it never comes to grips with the central problem, which is the inevitably devastating and deadly impacts of firing explosive weapons into inhabited urban areas like Mosul in Iraq, Raqqa in Syria, Mariupol in Ukraine, Sanaa in Yemen or Gaza in Palestine.<\/p> <p>The development of \u201cprecision weapons\u201d has demonstrably failed to prevent these massacres. The United States unveiled its new \u201csmart bombs\u201d during the First Gulf War in 1991. But they in fact comprised only 7 percent of the 88,000 tons of bombs it dropped on Iraq, reducing \u201ca rather highly urbanized and mechanized society\u201d to \u201ca pre-industrial age nation\u201d according to a U.N. survey.<\/p> <p>Instead of publishing actual data on the accuracy of these weapons, the Pentagon has maintained a sophisticated propaganda campaign to convey the impression that they are 100 percent accurate and can strike a target like a house or apartment building without harming civilians in the surrounding area.<\/p> <p>However, during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Rob Hewson, the editor of an arms trade journal that reviews the performance of air-launched weapons, estimated that 20 percent to 25 percent of U.S. \u201cprecision\u201d weapons missed their targets.<\/p> <p>Even when they do hit their target, these weapons do not perform like space weapons in a video game. The most commonly used bombs in the U.S. arsenal are 500-lb. bombs, with an explosive charge of 89 kilos of Tritonal. According to U.N. safety data, the blast alone from that explosive charge is 100 percent lethal up to a radius of 10 meters, and will break every window within 100 meters.<\/p> <p>That is just the blast effect. Deaths and horrific injuries are also caused by collapsing buildings and flying shrapnel and debris \u2014 concrete, metal, glass, wood etc.<\/p> <p>A strike is considered accurate if it lands within a \u201ccircular error probable,\u201d usually 10 meters around the object being targeted. So, in an urban area, if you take into account the \u201ccircular error probable,\u201d the blast radius, flying debris and collapsing buildings, even a strike assessed as \u201caccurate\u201d is very likely to kill and injure civilians.<\/p> <p>Howard Zinn\u2019s Challenge<\/p> <p>U.S. officials draw a moral distinction between this \u201cunintentional\u201d killing and the \u201cdeliberate\u201d killing of civilians by terrorists. But the late historian Howard Zinn challenged this distinction in a letter to The New York Times in 2007. He wrote,<\/p> <p>\u201cThese words are misleading because they assume an action is either \u2018deliberate\u2019 or \u2018unintentional.\u2019 There is something in between, for which the word is \u2018inevitable.\u2019 If you engage in an action, like aerial bombing, in which you cannot possibly distinguish between combatants and civilians (as a former Air Force bombardier, I will attest to that), the deaths of civilians are inevitable, even if not \u2018intentional.\u2019 Does that difference exonerate you morally? The terrorism of the suicide bomber and the terrorism of aerial bombardment are indeed morally equivalent. To say otherwise (as either side might) is to give one moral superiority over the other, and thus serve to perpetuate the horrors of our time.\u201d<\/p> <p>Americans are rightfully horrified when they see civilians killed by Russian bombardment in Ukraine, but they are generally not quite so horrified, and more likely to accept official justifications, when they hear that civilians are killed by U.S. forces or American weapons in Iraq, Syria, Yemen or Gaza.<\/p> <p>Key Media Role<\/p> <p>The Western corporate media play a key role in this, by showing us corpses in Ukraine and the wails of their loved ones, but shielding us from equally disturbing images of people killed by U.S. or allied forces.<\/p> <p>While Western leaders are demanding that Russia be held accountable for war crimes, they have raised no such clamor to prosecute U.S. officials. Yet during the U.S. military occupation of Iraq, both the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the U.N. Assistance Mission to Iraq (UNAMI) documented persistent and systematic violations of the Geneva Conventions by U.S. forces, including of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention that protects civilians from the impacts of war and military occupation.<\/p> <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and human rights groups documented systematic abuse and torture of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan, including cases in which U.S. troops tortured prisoners to death.<\/p> <p>Although torture was approved by U.S. officials all the way up to the White House, no officer above the rank of major was ever held accountable for a torture death in Afghanistan or Iraq. The harshest punishment handed down for torturing a prisoner to death was a five-month jail sentence, although that is a capital offense under the U.S. War Crimes Act.<\/p> <p>In a 2007 human rights report that described widespread killing of civilians by U.S. occupation forces, the U.N. Assistance Mission to Iraq wrote,<\/p> <p>\u201cCustomary international humanitarian law demands that, as much as possible, military objectives must not be located within areas densely populated by civilians. The presence of individual combatants among a great number of civilians does not alter the civilian character of an area.\u201d<\/p> <p>The report demanded<\/p> <p>\u201cthat all credible allegations of unlawful killings be thoroughly, promptly and impartially investigated, and appropriate action taken against military personnel found to have used excessive or indiscriminate force.\u201d<\/p> <p>Instead of investigating, the U.S. has actively covered up its war crimes. A tragic example is the 2019 massacre in the Syrian town of Baghuz, where a special U.S. military operations unit dropped massive bombs on a group of mainly women and children, killing about 70. The military not only failed to acknowledge the botched attack but even bulldozed the blast site to cover it up. Only after a New York Times expos\u00e9 years later did the military even admit that the strike took place.<\/p> <p>So it is ironic to hear President Joe Biden call for President Vladimir Putin to face a war crimes trial, when the United States covers up its own crimes, fails to hold its own senior officials accountable for war crimes and still rejects the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In 2020, former President Donald Trump went so far as to impose U.S. sanctions on the most senior ICC prosecutors for investigating U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>The Rand study repeatedly claims that U.S. forces have \u201ca deeply ingrained commitment to the law of war.\u201d But the destruction of Mosul, Raqqa and other cities and the history of U.S. disdain for the U.N. Charter, the Geneva Conventions and international courts tell a very different story.<\/p> <p>[Watch WikiLeaks \u201cCollateral Murder\u201d Video on YouTube.]<\/p> <p>We agree with the Rand report\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cDoD\u2019s weak institutional learning for civilian harm issues meant that past lessons went unheeded, increasing the risks to civilians in Raqqa.\u201d<\/p> <p>However, we take issue with the study\u2019s failure to recognize that many of the glaring contradictions it documents are consequences of the fundamentally criminal nature of this entire operation, under the Fourth Geneva Convention and the existing laws of war.<\/p> <p>Rejecting the Premise<\/p> <p>We reject the whole premise of this study, that U.S. forces should continue to conduct urban bombardments that inevitably kill thousands of civilians, and must therefore learn from this experience so that they will kill and maim fewer civilians the next time they destroy a city like Raqqa or Mosul.<\/p> <p>The ugly truth behind these U.S. massacres is that the impunity senior U.S. military and civilian officials have enjoyed for past war crimes encouraged them to believe they could get away with bombing cities in Iraq and Syria to rubble, inevitably killing tens of thousands of civilians.<\/p> <p>They have so far been proven right, but U.S. contempt for international law and the failure of the global community to hold the United States to account are destroying the very \u201crules-based order\u201d of international law that U.S. and Western leaders claim to cherish.<\/p> <p>As we call urgently for a ceasefire, for peace and for accountability for war crimes in Ukraine, we should say \u201cNever Again!\u201d to the bombardment of cities and civilian areas, whether they are in Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, Iran or anywhere else, and whether the aggressor is Russia, the United States, Israel or Saudi Arabia.<\/p> <p>And we should never forget that the supreme war crime is war itself, the crime of aggression, because, as the judges declared at Nuremberg, it \u201ccontains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\u201d<\/p> <p>It is easy to point fingers at others, but we will not stop war until we force our own leaders to live up to the principle spelled out by Supreme Court Justice and Nuremberg prosecutor Robert Jackson:<\/p> <p>\u201cIf certain acts in violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us.\u201d<\/p> <p>Medea Benjamin is the co-founder of CODEPINK: Women for Peace and the author of numerous books including Kingdom of the Unjust: Behind the US-Saudi Connection and Inside Iran: the Real History and Politics of the Islamic Republic of Iran.<\/p> <p>Nicolas J.

The third has still not been identified 17 years after the torture was committed.<\/p> <p>In the courtroom of the military commission, the CIA officer was referred to only by three-digit code NZ7, or simply as \u201cthe Preacher\u201d \u2013 a nickname he was given because of his peculiar way of terrorising detainees.<\/p> <p>According to James Mitchell, a psychologist on contract to the CIA who helped draft and apply their \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d, the Preacher \u201cwould at random times put one hand on the forehead of a detainee, raise the other high in the air, and in a deep Southern drawl say things like, \u2018Can you feel it, son? Can you feel the spirit moving down my arm, into your body?\u2019\u201d<\/p> <p>Mitchell gave that chilling description in his memoir, Enhanced Interrogation, and on the witness stand on Thursday, he confirmed the Preacher\u2019s role at the CIA black sites. He was giving evidence at a pre-trial hearing in the case against five defendants charged for the 9\/11 al-Qaida attacks, including the self-styled mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.<\/p> <p>Mitchell, together with his friend and business partner, Bruce Jessen \u2013 who is due to testify next week \u2013 have been the public face of the US torture programme for five years, settling out of court in 2017 in a civil suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three prisoners.<\/p> <p>Almost everyone else involved in the extensive programme, involving a network of black sites around the world, has remained in the shadows. In terms of legality, it is still the dark side of the moon.<\/p> <p>Defence lawyers at the Guant\u00e1namo military commission hearings have asked to examine 52 witnesses. They have so far been permitted to question only two, Mitchell and Jessen.<\/p> <p>James Connell, representing defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, lost his patience on Thursday when prosecutors objected that he was asking Mitchell about events he had not directly witnessed.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only witness we\u2019ve got. The government has blocked all the CIA witnesses,\u201d Connell complained.<\/p> <p>Four days before the current pre-trial hearing, the 40th in eight years of legal skirmishes, the prosecution changed the classification rules, and amended them again on Monday on the evening before the first open session. As a result, some facts that were previously unclassified, in published books for example, were reclassified, sending defence attorneys scrambling to reframe their planned line of questioning.<\/p> <p>The longer the hearings have continued, the clearer it has become that the Mitchell and Jessen partnership was just a small part of the infrastructure of torture, with its own bureaucracy and personal rivalries. In his testimony, Mitchell railed repeatedly against the \u201cmiddle management\u201d who he believed was plotting against him.<\/p> <p>Mitchell became embroiled in a vicious turf war with a rival, the CIA chief of interrogations, for mastery of the \u201cenhanced programme\u201d. Each sought to use their links to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to get the other removed from their post. In that struggle the detainees were used as bargaining counters. The two men had them tortured for training or demonstration purposes.<\/p> <p>In the courtroom this week, the interrogations chief has been referred to by the code NX2. Mitchell calls him the \u201cnew sheriff\u201d, but it has been reported his real name was Charlie Wise, who had honed his craft carrying out interrogations for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s. He apparently died of a heart attack in 2003, just weeks after being dismissed.<\/p> <p>Giving evidence at a military commission on Guant\u00e1namo Bay, James Mitchell gave a detailed account of the 2002 decision to interrogate suspected al-Qaida leaders using water boarding and other techniques. Photograph: Supplied<\/p> <p>According to declassified cables and courtroom testimony, Wise set up his own training programme, and took his students to a black site in Afghanistan, codenamed Cobalt, to practise their techniques on Ammar al-Baluchi and other prisoners. During that training, Baluchi was repeatedly slammed against a wall, suffering brain trauma as a result.<\/p> <p>\u201cLooks like they used your client as a training prop,\u201d Mitchell told Connell. A newly declassified paragraph in a secret CIA inspector general report quotes one of the students as saying the site was used for \u201con-the-job training\u201d. Trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification.<\/p> <p>An unsanctioned, improvised waterboard was also set up at the Cobalt site, according to defence lawyers. It does not seem to have been part of the training, but it was used on at least one detainee.<\/p> <p>The CIA was forced to close down its first main interrogation centre in Thailand in late 2002 when its existence was discovered by the New York Times. The \u201chigh value detainees\u201d were transferred by rendition flights to a new site in Poland, codenamed Blue, which was run by Wise.<\/p> <p>Mitchell visited Blue shortly before Christmas in 2002, and testified he witnessed at least two extreme techniques that had not been approved by the CIA or the justice department. In one, a piece of wooden dowel was put behind the knees of a detainee who was made to kneel and then had his back forced back \u201cuntil his shoulder blades were touching the floor\u201d.<\/p> <p>In another, the prisoner\u2019s elbows were strapped together with a strap behind his back and his hands were raised above his head. Fearing the torture would cause permanent injury, Mitchell said he tried to stop it but was told \u201cit was none of my fucking business\u201d.<\/p> <p>When the contractor declared he wanted to return to the US, Wise told him he was not allowed to leave, Mitchell claimed. Nor could Mitchell contact the outside world as all communications equipment at the site were locked up. For a week he was a prisoner of his rival, he said.<\/p> <p>Mitchell said he was finally permitted to go home because the tension inside the site began damaging morale. On his return he said he complained to the CIA leadership but to no avail. Wise stayed in his job and Mitchell found he was giving courses at headquarters including the banned techniques more than four months later. The chief of interrogation was only fired that summer.<\/p> <p>Throughout his testimony this week, Mitchell has portrayed himself as a moderate who stuck to the rules and only used extreme measures when he felt he had no choice.<\/p> <p>He tried to halt waterboarding of the first major detainee, Abu Zubaydah, in August 2002, arguing that the prisoner was fully cooperating, but his superiors in Langley ordered told him and his team in the original black site in Thailand to \u201cstay the course\u201d.<\/p> <p>In an effort to win the argument, he said he persuaded the head CIA officer in the country to witness a waterboarding for himself.<\/p> <p>\u201cI wanted the chief of station to experience what we were experiencing,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t smell pleasant. It smelled like sweat \u2013 kinda musky.\u201d<\/p> <p>He also conceded he and Jessen were beginning to feel a bit exposed. They realised they were the only ones in the interrogation room not wearing a mask, and the torture was being videoed.<\/p> <p>\u201cI wanted [the station chief] on tape,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cMy mental calculus was that Dr Jessen and I were the only ones on that tape.\u201d<\/p> <p>The station chief turned up to watching Abu Zubaydah being waterboarded, but dressed as a guard, his face covered<\/p> <p>When his superiors insisted he persevere in Thailand, he told them to send a delegation to witness the simulated drowning.<\/p> <p>\u201cBuddy \u2013 you want it,\u201d Mitchell told them. \u201cBring your rubber boots and come on down.\u201d<\/p> <p>When the senior officials flew in, on 17 August, he waterboarded Abu Zubaydah even though he was quite sure the detainee had no actionable intelligence to surrender. It was done purely as a demonstration for the agency VIPs. And he applied the technique to the maximum extent allowed, pouring water on to a cloth on the prisoner\u2019s face for 20 seconds and then a full 40 seconds. According to a CIA cable describing the event, Abu Zubaydah went into spasm.<\/p> <p>2006 file photo: US military guards walk within Camp Delta military-run prison, at the Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base, Cuba. Photograph: Brennan Linsley\/AP\/AP<\/p> <p>The visitors were stunned. \u201cSome of the folks were tearful,\u201d Mitchell said.<\/p> <p>\u201cI was tearful, but I cry at dog food commercials,\u201d Mitchell claimed. The psychologist\u2019s eyes did indeed well up on a few occasions during his testimony this week, but the tears came when he was describing what he saw as his personal sacrifices. In contrast, he described waterboarding dispassionately, characterising it as \u201ctemporary discomfort\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cDoes he care more about dog food commercials than he cares about human beings?\u201d asked Terry Rockefeller, who was watching Mitchell\u2019s testimony this week from the military commission\u2019s public gallery on the other side of a reinforced glass partition.<\/p> <p>Her sister, Laura, was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Centre. She was an actress who just happened to be working in the twin towers in New York on September 11, 2001, on a day job hosting a business seminar on risk assessment.<\/p> <p>Terry is a member of a relatives\u2019 group called September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, which is seeking justice for the attacks but opposes the use of the death penalty.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe fact that he can talk about something like waterboarding in such clinical terms ... That\u2019s just crushing to me, because my country did it and because I feel a great loss,\u201d Rockefeller said, pointing out that the use of torture against the defendants has vastly complicated the process of putting them on trial.<\/p> <p>\u201cI do think that everyone involved in the ... enhanced interrogation programmes is probably going to die [before the legal process ends] \u2013 everyone who suffered from it; everyone who was complicit in it \u2013 and there will be this eternally lost opportunity to reckon with it,\u201d she said.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"374UMBUHN74H5PFESY4F03TLQKOTC6"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1076,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other","torture"],"year":"2002","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Thailand","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ammar al-Baluchi","victim_keywords":"CIA, torture, Afghanistan,","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Abu Zubaydah","victim_keywords":"CIA, tortured, waterboarding","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"prisoners, CIA, Guant\u00e1namo, Thailand, Poland, Afghanistan, torture, waterboarding","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other","torture"],"year":"2002","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Thailand","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ammar al-Baluchi","victim_keywords":"CIA, torture, Afghanistan,","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Abu Zubaydah","victim_keywords":"CIA, tortured, waterboarding","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"prisoners, CIA, Guant\u00e1namo, Thailand, Poland, Afghanistan, torture, waterboarding","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":997520525,"Input.title":"Iranian sharpshooter olympian should have been turned over to Interpol, not given gold medal","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-31 10:46:44.338982","Input.article_interface":"<p>For 49 years through 11 consecutive Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to formally honor the memory of 11 Israeli athletes murdered by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Munich Games.<\/p> <p>Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter<\/p> <p>The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) lobbied for the Los Angeles Games back in 1984 to do just that.<\/p> <p>5 \u05e6\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d2\u05dc\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 Ilana Romano and Ankie Spitzer, widows of murdered Israeli athletes at 2021 ceremony honoring victims of 1972 terror attack ( Photo: Olympic Committee )<\/p> <p>Our pleas fell on deaf ears and instead we convened our own memorial at the SWC for the families \u2013 including for Mimi Weinberg and her young son, Guri Weinberg, who still grieve for Israeli wrestler Moshe Weinberg, whose heroics allowed other athletes to escape while he blocked the murderers at the door.<\/p> <p>5 \u05e6\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d2\u05dc\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 Israel's delegation to the 1972 Munich Olympic games attend opening ceremony ( Photo: AFP )<\/p> <p>He paid with his own life.

But business and social activities picked up later in the day.<\/p> <p>A group of angry youths were seen at the Mokola Roundabout in Ibadan demanding better governance.<\/p> <p>The youths carried posters, placards and banners with different inscriptions conveying their displeasure over the situation in the country.<\/p> <p>Akure youths remove blockade mounted by protesters<\/p> <p>Protesters in Ondo State blocked the Akure-Ibadan highway and insisted on searching vehicles.<\/p> <p>The development caused heavy traffic on the busy road.<\/p> <p>But their efforts led to the recovery of two guns and other dangerous weapons in a Toyota commercial bus.<\/p> <p>The owners of the weapons were handed over to operatives of the Ondo Amotekun Corps.<\/p> <p>The protesters resisted attempts by military personnel to remove the blockade on the Akure-Ibadan highway.<\/p> <p>They vowed to continue their protest and must search all the vehicles plying the route.<\/p> <p>However, the blockade by protesters near the Oba Market in Akure was dismantled by youths from the town who had pledged not to participate in any protest for fear that it could be hijacked by hoodlums.<\/p> <p>Journalists, human rights lawyer arrested in Calabar<\/p> <p>Security operatives arrested three journalists and a human rights lawyer in Calabar over the June 12 protests in the city.<\/p> <p>Arrested were Agba Jalingo, publisher of Cross River Watch online newspaper, his news editor, Jonathan Ugbal, a yet to be named reporter and James Ibor, a lawyer.<\/p> <p>The police also dispersed a group of protesters around the Rabbana Roundabout and Atekong Junction.<\/p> <p>The security operatives, who were masked, rode into the areas in vehicles belonging to Operation Akpakwu.<\/p> <p>The protesters carried placards with inscriptions such as \u201cAyade, pay owed salaries and pensions\u201d, \u201cAyade, fix our roads\u201d, Ayade, change your style of governance\u201d, among others.<\/p> <p>One of the protesters, Mr Timothy Ushang, said the protest was going on peacefully when the policemen fired tear gas canisters at them.<\/p> <p>According to him, the essence of the protest is to draw government\u2019s attention to areas that needed urgent intervention in the state.<\/p> <p>Governor Ben Ayade had earlier warned that he would not tolerate any form of protest or procession in the state.<\/p> <p>Jalingo, who was earlier imprisoned for nearly a year over an alleged attempt to topple Ayade\u2019s government, was detained by the police on allegation of gun running.<\/p> <p>Before the arrest of rights lawyer James Ibor, police had ransacked his law office on Kings Street Calabar, where his staff were threatened.<\/p> <p>Police teargas, disperse protesters in Abuja<\/p> <p>Police personnel dispersed June 12 protesters and members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) at Gudu, Abuja.<\/p> <p>The protesters, who were led by activist Deji Adeyanju, chanted \u201cBuhari must go\u201d, \u201cSay no to injustice\u201d, amongst other solidarity phrases.<\/p> <p>They also carried placards with inscriptions such as \u201cThis is Not A Dictatorship\u201d; \u201c#Buhari Must Go #Revolution Now\u201d; \u201cDigital Right is Human Right\u201d; \u201cBandits Now Have Colony Within Our Country\u201d.<\/p> <p>Addressing the protesters, Adeyanju said: \u201cWhy we are on the street protesting is that the government must meet certain demands and ensure that its primary responsibilities like protecting lives and property, the insecurity across the country, and extrajudicial killings ongoing across the country are tackled.<\/p> <p>\u201cConstant attacks against protesters, the issue of Twitter ban should be addressed. The turnout all over the country was massive; even abroad. We thank all the organisers who joined us on this cause.\u201d<\/p> <p>One of the protesters, John Ola, said: \u201cWe cannot continue like this \u2026 all the bad governance must stop,\u201d as police shouted at demonstrators to leave the scene.<\/p> <p>Spokesman for the Federal Capital Territory Police Command, Mariam Yusuf, said that the command had restored calm in the area, adding that the group and other protesters had targeted inciting public disturbance and breaching public peace.<\/p> <p>She said that no arrest was made but that the action of the command was necessitated by concerns of some agitated residents.<\/p> <p>She said in a statement that the police dispersed the protesters to stop incitement of public disturbance.<\/p> <p>Her words: \u201cThe FCT Police Command on Saturday, June 12, 2021, successfully restored calm at Apo-Gudu axis after professionally dispersing a protest by some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria \u2013 Shiites and others targeted at inciting public disturbance and breaching public peace.<\/p> <p>\u201cConsequently, the action of the command was necessitated by the concerns of some agitated residents. However, no arrest was made.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn view of the above, the command wishes to state that it is committed to ensuring that FCT residents enjoy a hitch-free Democracy Day celebration and will not hesitate to bring to book every person or entity that attempts to breach the peace or cause a breakdown of law and order in the Federal Capital Territory.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe command implores residents to remain calm and law-abiding while reaffirming its unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT.\u201d<\/p> <p>Use of teargas was in line with global standards \u2013 Police<\/p> <p>Justifying the use of tear gas on protesters, chief spokesman for the Nigeria Police, Frank Mba, said the police action was in line with international best practices of dispersing violent protests.<\/p> <p>Mba told Channels Television that the Abuja incident was even an isolated case because the protesters turned violent.<\/p> <p>He said: \u201cWe had an isolated case in Abuja where some of the protesters became unruly, and in line with international best practices, police fired teargas at them.<\/p> <p>\u201cAnd that is an acceptable mode of engaging violent protesters anywhere in the world, whether it is in Abuja, Lagos, Paris, London, or New York or California. That is internationally accepted.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe would have problems if we had fired live bullets at them. But when you fire teargas at protesters to disperse them, you are not in breach of any known code, either nationally or internationally.<\/p> <p>\u201cI also want to use this opportunity to state clearly that no citizen, either in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Kano or anywhere, is currently in detention as a result of this isolated incident.<\/p> <p>\u201cAs long as protesters conduct themselves within the confines of the law, they do not constitute themselves into nuisance, they do not breach the rights of other citizens, they do not obstruct traffic, they do not compel other citizens to join their protests, the police will largely work with them.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen you protest in contravention of these set of conditions I have given, clearly, you are coming in direct conflict with the laws of the land, and the police will never stand by idly and watch you create problems for the entire polity.\u201d<\/p> <p>We were paid \u20a61,500 to counter June 12 protest \u2013 pro-Buhari protester<\/p> <p>Some people held their own rally at the Unity Fountain, Abuja to express support for President Muhammadu Buhari on the occasion of Democracy Day.<\/p> <p>They wore customised T-shirts and placards, some of which bore the inscriptions \u2018Nigerians say no to fake activists\u2019, \u2018Nigerians say no to violence\u2019.<\/p> <p>They claimed they were promised between \u20a61,000 and \u20a61,500 to participate in the rally.<\/p> <p>CSOs, NAOS stage peaceful protest in Osogbo<\/p> <p>The Osun Civil Society Coalition and the National Association of Osun Students (NAOS) held a peaceful protest in Osogbo, calling for a better Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Members of the groups moved from Alekuwodo to the popular Oke-fia roundabout, carrying placards with different inscriptions.<\/p> <p>They also chanted solidarity songs.<\/p> <p>Security operatives were seen at strategic locations during the protest to forestall violence.<\/p> <p>The Coordinator of Osun Democracy Vanguard, Mr Emmanuel Olowu, who spoke to newsmen during the protest, said that democracy was the bedrock of development of any society.<\/p> <p>He urged that all Nigerians must embrace democracy to the fullest.<\/p> <p>Kano youths offer special prayers for Nigeria<\/p> <p>Some youths in Kano used the occasion of Democracy Day to offer special prayers for Nigeria\u2019s socio-political and economic prosperity.<\/p> <p>Abba Isma\u2019il, who led the youths, said a group of patriotic Nigerians mobilised their friends for the prayers.<\/p> <p>He said though they have been praying daily for the country\u2019s prosperity, yesterday\u2019s special prayers were specifically to mark the Democracy Day being celebrated nationwide.<\/p> <p>He said: \u201cEvery citizen of the country knows that what the country needs currently is divine intervention in many fronts.<\/p> <p>\u201cChallenging the leadership of the country or the system of governance will not bail us out of our predicament because we are all part of the issues.\u201d<\/p> <p>Benin protesters want good governance<\/p> <p>Hundreds of Edo State residents gathered in Benin to demand good governance during the Democracy Day rally.<\/p> <p>The peaceful protest took off from the National Museum at Ring Road, Benin and moved to Government House, where participants were addressed by Edo State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu, who described godfatherism as the bane of democracy in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>He commended the protesters for conducting themselves peacefully.<\/p> <p>The leader of the Edo protesters, Kola Edokpayi, a frontline human rights activist, called on the Godwin Obaseki administration to ensure that the 14 members-elect of Edo House of Assembly were given the opportunity to represent their constituencies instead of being shut out.<\/p> <p>He said: \u201cWhat we now hear is \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 who are killing people in the Southeast zone and other parts of Nigeria, while the country is becoming unsafe to live in because of insecurity.<\/p> <p>\u201cPrices of goods and services are also moving up daily, beyond the reach of the common man.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Edo State, the Benin-Ekpoma-Auchi-Abuja Road is still unsafe, despite the efforts of the federal and state governments as well as the security agencies.\u201d<\/p> <p>Edokpayi also stated that governments at all levels must be responsive and that the residents must not be docile but put the leaders on their toes in order to ensure good governance and the sustenance of democracy.<\/p> <p>Enugu residents shun protest<\/p> <p>Residents of Enugu shunned the Democracy Day protest championed by the Save Nigeria Group (SNG) in parts of the country.<\/p> <p>The city was peaceful and calm yesterday.<\/p> <p>The popular Michael Okpara Square, usually the epicentre and meeting point of such protests, was practically empty.<\/p> <p>However, there were a few patrol vehicles and officers of the Nigeria Police Force at the square and other strategic locations in the city.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Vincent Michael, who was at Okpara Square for a fitness exercise, said that residents of the state did not participate in the protest for fear of the unknown.<\/p> <p>Michael said that the security situation in the area and responses from security agencies were enough to make anyone to lie low.<\/p> <p>Celebration low-key in Sokoto<\/p> <p>The Democracy Day celebration was low key in Sokoto State with residents going about their normal activities.<\/p> <p>However, residents called for commitment of government in providing dividends of democracy instead of giving priority to ceremonies while marking the day.<\/p> <p>Malam Abunakar Mailato said uplifting the living condition of people required planning ahead and absolute determination to attain set goals.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is the need for those at the helm of affairs to be pro-active and determined to attain set goals, just as they struggle to surmount challenges that will come their ways,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Mailato, who is a youth leader, said although progress had been made in the struggle to ensure a sustained democracy in the country, there was still room for improvement.<\/p> <p>Another resident, Sidi Muhammad, emphasised the need to strengthen the justice system to ensure respect for rule of law that would guarantee equity and peace.<\/p> <p>Muhammad urged Nigerians to imbibe the spirit of constructive criticisms in their efforts at correcting the lapses of leaders, rather than deliberately \u201chunting for faults to win political goals.\u201d<\/p> <p>Business as usual in Imo<\/p> <p>It was business as usual yesterday across Imo State despite the Democracy Day celebration.<\/p> <p>Residents who had at first hesitated to come out trooped out to go about their economic and social activities.<\/p> <p>A protest scheduled for the day was cancelled after the police said no one would be allowed to disturb the peace.<\/p> <p>Nigerians stage #June 12 protest in London<\/p> <p>Some Nigerians residing in the United Kingdom also staged a protest to mark Democracy Day.<\/p> <p>The protesters converged on the National Gallery in London.<\/p> <p>Akintunde Babatunde, who shared some of the footages from the venue of the protest, commended the professionalism of the police whom he said were decent and were guiding them, unlike their Nigerian counterparts.<\/p> <p>He said that the protesters were using the occasion to the call the attention of the world to the terrible situation of governance in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are currently protesting in London and there\u2019s no violence from police officers. They\u2019re decent and guiding us well without shooting or tear gas. This is what I want for my country,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sending a strong message to the world of the terrible situation in our dear country.\u201d<\/p> <p>Other protesters carried placards that boldly read: \u201cSAY NO TO GOVERNMENT FUNDED TERRORISM\u201d; \u201cWE DEMAND JUSTICE, GOD IS GOD ALL THE TIME.\u201d Some were also seen waving \u2018Biafran\u2019 and \u2018Oduduwa nation\u2019 flags.<\/p> <p>Canada, UK, US, Amnesty ask Nigerian security forces to respect citizens\u2019 right to peaceful protests<\/p> <p>The Canadian, United Kingdom and United States missions in Nigeria asked law enforcement agencies to respect citizens\u2019 rights to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstrations.<\/p> <p>The US embassy in a tweet said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to promoting democracy, transparency & accountability,\u201d adding, \u201c#Democracy carries responsibilities. Calm and restraint support fundamental freedoms.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Acting Canadian High Commissioner Nicolas Simard said: \u201cRight to peaceful assembly is also a fundamental human right protected by #Nigeria\u2019s constitution and international human rights instruments.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe call on all parties to exercise restraint and on Nigerian law enforcement agencies to remain within proportional use of force.\u201d<\/p> <p>On its part, the British High Commission called for the protection of the right to peaceful protests.<\/p> <p>Amnesty International said it had been receiving \u201cdisturbing reports of attacks on peaceful protesters in Abuja, Lagos and Ibadan.\u2019<\/p> <p>It said: \u201cSome protesters have also been arrested while others were injured #June 12thProtest#Nigeria.<\/p> <p>PDP condemns clampdown on protesters<\/p> <p>The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday condemned what it called a clampdown on peaceful protesters on Democracy Day.<\/p> <p>The party\u2019s spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, branded as sacrilegious \u201cthe brutal clampdown on Nigerian citizens.\u201d<\/p> <p>His words: \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) condemns, in the strongest term ever, the violent clampdown by agents of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari on Nigerians who are peacefully protesting on Democracy Day.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is awkward that the APC and President Buhari, who were allowed their freedom when they protested in 2014, would turn around to subject Nigerians to actions of inhumanity including the use of firearms against the people, as being witnessed today.\u2019<\/p> <p>According to the PDP, the failure by President Buhari to call security operatives to order during his Democracy Day speech \u201cplaces the culpability for whatever befalls Nigerians in the face of the violent attacks by security agencies, on the APC as well as Mr. President\u2019s desk.\u201d<\/p> <p>Abiola family: No benefits to show for MKO\u2019s sacrifice<\/p> <p>The family of the late Chief M.K.O, Abiola, the main honouree of Democracy Day, said yesterday that there were not enough benefits yet for his family to show for the huge sacrifice he made for the enthronement of democracy in the country.<\/p> <p>Secretary of the family, Engineer Rahman Abiola, said no monetary benefit had accrued to the family from government to cushion the effects of losing such an irreplaceable pillar.<\/p> <p>Rahman commended President Muhammadu Buhari administration for the recognition accorded MKO Abiola as the winner of the June 12, 1993 Presidential election and declaration of the day as Democracy Day, but he noted that the family also deserved government\u2019s compensation that would directly impact on Abiola family members positively.<\/p> <p>The Family Secretary made this position known while speaking with newsmen yesterday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital when the entourage of the state government\u2019s team, led by the deputy governor, Engineer Noimot Salako-Oyedele, paid the usual annual visitation to the Abiola\u2019s family house at Oke Agbo Abeokuta metropolis in honour of the deceased.<\/p> <p>He said: \u201cWe are happy indeed that the Buhari led Federal Government deemed it fit to honour our breadwinner, late Chief M.K.O Abiola, particularly with the highest title of the land: Grand Commander of the Federal Republic (GCFR) and declaring June 12 as the official democracy day in Nigeria. But so far, not so good!<\/p> <p>\u201cThe family has not benefited anything from the Federal Government. But Ogun State Government, right from the administration of the former governor, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, that of Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Ibikunle Amosun and the incumbent state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has found it good to honour late Chief M.K.O Abiola, even before the Federal Government took it up to honour him every June 12.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have not seen any of the promises of the Federal Government on June 12. At the state level, they\u2019re trying, and I give kudos to them. The governors have been coming to solidarise with the family towards ensuring that June 12 is celebrated.\u201d<\/p> <p>Speaking earlier Deputy Governor Salako-Oyedele advised the citizens, particularly politicians, to always emulate the virtues and philosophy which late Abiola stood for.<\/p> <p>She said: \u201cWe give thanks to Mr. President for formerly declaring this day as Democracy Day. As you are aware, the late Chief M.K.O Abiola (GCFR) is an unpoliticised and detribalised Nigerian.

When Sunitha Krishnan, co-founder of Prajwala, went to meet a child featured in it, she expected a scared, silent, suspicious person. Instead, she found a cherubic 12-year-old girl, bursting with enthusiasm. Praniti (name changed) was no problem child. She attended school, was polite and never begged for chips or soda. She would chat with a close friend online, someone her parents assumed was from school. Nothing prepared them for the discovery that the person was a stranger and that sexually explicit photographs of their daughter were all over the internet. Praniti's reaction was different. There was only denial. \"She was adamant this person was her friend, that she had done nothing wrong,\" says Krishnan. The biggest threat in children being 'groomed' through the internet is the complete transfer of trust from the prey to the predator. It destroys the construct of victimhood in a child's mind. \"The child doesn't know he or she is being exploited. Imagine a childhood spent grappling with the notion of betrayal and abuse,\" says Krishnan.<\/p> <p>Cyber grooming of the very young, like Praniti, is the newest threat in a booming online child pornography market that has reached alarming proportions in India (see Perverse Patterns). According to the US-based National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), India now accounts for the maximum number of online child sexual abuse imagery in the world, followed by Thailand. NCMEC estimates that Indian users have uploaded 25,000 images or videos in just the past five months. Delhi tops the list for the maximum uploads of child porn, followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. \"Innovation and the internet come with their own set of challenges, some of which are alarming as in child pornography,\" says Dr Gulshan Rai, chief information security officer in the prime minister's office. \"The IT Act bans the viewing, creation and distribution of child pornography in the country, but it still happens. Moreover, intermediaries like social networks are not removing such content fast enough. They are not owning up to their responsibility towards society, focusing instead on revenue and maximum visibility.\"<\/p> <p>Indian users have uploaded 25,000 images or videos in just the past five months. Delhi tops the list.<\/p> <p>Anyonea family member, criminal racket or cyber strangercan create child porn. They need not be paedophiles. \"We are seeing an increase in self-generated child porn,\" says Sidd-harth Pillai, co-founder of Aarambh, which runs a helpline for reporting child porn. Government figures also show that circulation of child porn is on the rise. Last year, 377 websites were blocked in India for posting child porn content. According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, 781 cases of creating or storing child porn were recorded in 2018. In 2017, it had been 331 cases. Odisha had the maximum number of such cases (333) in 2018, as opposed to only eight in 2017. \"Much of child abuse footage is filmed inside homes by known relatives or family friends. This could happen anywhereurban, rural, poor, rich. There would also be an offline apparatus where victims of sex trafficking could be filmed,\" says Pillai.<\/p> <p>Source: The latest transparency reports of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram<\/p> <p>Reports show that approximately 100 people have been arrested or summoned for viewing and distributing child porn across the country since November 2019. Additionally, Gujarat's Crime Investigation Department received names of 62 paedophiles in the same month. In October 2019, the CBI filed cases against seven Indians involved in an international child sex racket. What is not mentioned is whether these same people also create content. According to the NCRB, one child is sexually abused every 15 minutes in India. While there is no single figure for how much of this happens within homes, those working with victims and several independent studies estimate that 70-90 per cent of all child abuse is perpetrated by people known to the child. \"Often couples or child abusers film their acts, and this content gets leaked. There is also grave concern over children being groomed to participate in sexual activities through social media friends,\" says Pillai. Child sex abuse is not just traumatic in a person's formative years, it creates a cycle of abuse. According to a 2008 study in the International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 'pathological family atmosphere with precocious exposures to sexual behaviours and sexual acts, traumatic sexual experiences in childhood, sexual interests and exploration, deprivation and failure in romantic relationships, and young boys who have been coerced into homosexual acts, are at increased risk of becoming young sexual offenders.'<\/p> <p>There are also reports of an offline, unorganised child porn industry, perhaps a subset of the larger organised porn industry in India. \"Sexual abuse also exists where trafficking does,\" says Krishnan. One can assume child sexual imagery could be beginning in areas that are hubs of trafficking-West Bengal, Rajasthan, Maharasthra being the top three, shows NCRB data.<\/p> <p>Alarmed by the reports, Rajya Sabha chairman and vice-president Venkaiah Naidu set up a committee under the leadership of the Congress's Jairam Ramesh in December 2019. The 14-member committee met with social media firms and representatives from the women and child development, electronics & IT and home affairs ministries to discuss two key issues: children accessing pornographic material and the circulation of child porn. Around 40 recommendations were submitted in the final report last month. At present, instances of child porn are not reported to a governing body or recorded and made public by social media companies, a practice the same firms follow in the US. The US also has cyber crime teams that monitor and track down child porn creators based on these reports. The Rajya Sabha report has recommended that a central body be set up to whom online platforms can report IP addresses of those searching for child porn. While the panel did consider several legislative, technological and institutional measures for those viewing and promoting child porn, it did not include how content creators or those advocating sexual activities to children online will be tracked. The menace is largely to be dealt with on visible circulation channels. And while digital safety education was recommended, nothing was mentioned on sex education for children to be more aware of their bodies and rights. The report's impact on lawmakers and subsequent implementation of the recommendations remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>While the electronics & IT ministry had earlier recommended that automated tools weed out terrorism and child porn, it is likely that the final draft of the guidelines for IT intermediaries will mandate only child porn be monitored and removed. The final call on revised guidelines is expected in the next few weeks.<\/p> <p>Among the people the committee consulted and who also helped draft the final report was Amol Deshmukh of research outfit Herd Foundation. \"Online exploitation of children is a major concern,\" he says. \"We have recommended that cyber grooming, advocating or counselling sexual activities with a person under 18, be made an offence under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. We also discussed setting up a cyber-crime investigative agency in India, especially to monitor the dark web, where a major chunk of child porn is viewed.\" However, monitoring of online criminal marketplaces, like the dark web, did not make it to the final Rajya Sabha report.<\/p> <p>The dark web<\/p> <p>Social media giants are beginning to act against child pornography in India. In February 2019, the company website stated that 'over the last three months, WhatsApp has banned approximately 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery'. YouTube removed 851,441 videos citing child safety concerns between July and September 2019. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, too, removed millions of such images and videos last year. However, this is just the trackable surface web. What is available on the dark web can never be fully documented. Playpen, a dark website the FBI shut down in 2015, had 215,000 users and 23,000 sexually explicit images of children, even toddlers.<\/p> <p>India is currently among the top 10 countries logging on to the dark web, according to metrics released by the TOR Project, an open-source software for enabling anonymous communication (50,000 Indians logged on daily as of January 2020). Figures can fluctuate depending on how people access the network, and how they cover their tracks. In 2014, the figure was over 200,000 a day for India. According to Hyderabad-based ethical hacker Bharat Rao, \"It is now very simple for people to hide their location, thanks to online tutorials and virtual private networks. This makes it harder to track actual user numbers. I don't think the figures since 2014 have reduced, people are just accessing the dark web differently and more covertly.\"<\/p> <p>Tracking a single user on the dark web can take 3-4 months. For websites, much more.<\/p> <p>Unlike the surface web, where websites are indexed on search engines, the dark web helps sites achieve total anonymity. Software like TOR directs internet traffic through hundreds of virtual tunnels. These tunnels are created between nodes (or relays). Each time data is transmitted, a random route is picked between these nodes. TOR also goes a step further and deploys the 'onion routing' of data. Imagine driving from Delhi to Jaipur-instead of taking the direct NH-48, you drive through a number of other towns and cities to reach it. None of the cities will know which other city you visited except the one before and after it. And each time you go, you take a different route. This is essentially how a user connects to the deep web; the convoluted, hidden route maintains blanket secrecy.<\/p> <p>A user can access the dark web very simply. All one has to do is download a TOR browser (available as an app on smartphones and downloadable on desktops), and connect. On the deep web, there is no Google. Instead, you have search engines like The Hidden Wiki, Duck Duck Go and TOR Links. These will not show you any results for child porn, which is 'officially' banned just as on the surface web, complying with the guidelines of the offline world. However, logging on to specialised encrypted search engines like Onion Land and Onion Dir takes you to a different world. On Onion Land alone, a search for 'child porn' throws up over 130 website links, and a search for 'child porn India' around 50. There are websites which sell children as slaves, host videos of child torture, images of children with aggressive animals and of children taking nude selfies. A search for 'nude child Indian' on Onion Land reveals 42 links, and one listed images by caste, state, colour, gender and age.<\/p> <p>Rather than names, websites on the dark web are a random alphanumeric sequence strung together with the domain name '.onion'. For example, a link describing 'india child stripping to bra' was 'jnsbixyz32lsex82nm.onion'. Transactions to access such content are made in Bitcoin. On jnsbixyz32lsex82nm.onion, the price to view five images was about Rs 6,000 in Bitcoin. To gauge the popularity and cost-effectiveness of these links, you only have to visit the various crowdfunding platforms for child porn. One website-uh3xkebozq5n6ygv.onion (listed on a Reddit forum)-lets you view images and videos only after 500 users have paid around Rs 800 in Bitcoin.<\/p> <p>The centre has banned child porn, but is yet to set up a dedicated agency to investigate cases.<\/p> <p>Content is also sold on the hundreds of marketplaces of the deep web. Popular ones include Empire, Berlusconi, Cave to R, Black Mart, Dream and Elite. Most of the products on sale here are drugs or weapons. All marketplaces have the disclaimer that selling child porn is banned. And it is indeed not a product for transaction, until you start a chat. Encrypted, chats are where cyber groomers peddle content. On Elite, a buyer for static images quoted the following rates: 'Child Front: Rs 4,000\/ Child Back: Rs 6,000' (rupee equivalents of Bitcoin). More can be offered for videos, children with objects, children with other children, or children with adults. These chat rooms are heavily monitored-even something as inconspicuous as taking a screenshot of a conversation can trigger off an alert, and instant blocking out.<\/p> <p>Currently, India does not have the resources to crack down on such operations. \"The dark web cannot be regulated and it will require a full-fledged investigative agency to even try. At present, we don't even have one for the surface web,\" says Mukesh Choudhary, a cyber crime expert who has trained close to 5,000 armed forces officials and police in India on cyber crime investigations. \"Hunting for users through the dark web is very hard,\" he adds. \"Websites change links, people hide locations, routes of data transfer are hidden and different each time.\" Rai makes a similar point: \"The dark web is extremely time-consuming to regulate. At times, it can be impossible.\" Tracking a single user on the dark web can take 3-4 months; tracking a website even more. A US-South Korea crackdown on a child porn dark website called Welcome to Video took over two years. Transactions in cryptocurrency, onion routing, encrypted chats and Protonmail (which also cannot be tracked) are the biggest hurdles for dark web investigators.<\/p> <p>The road ahead<\/p> <p>Various stakeholders are involved in child protection, each playing a different role. Social media platforms are clear there is zero tolerance for any kind of child abuse. A Twitter India spokesperson says, \"We have been at the forefront of responding to the challenge of preventing the exploitation of children on the internet and will continue to fight online child sexual abuse and invest in essential technology and tools.\" What these tools are, the company is unwilling to divulge.<\/p> <p>ShareChat, however, is open to sharing that they use artificial intelligence (AI) to detect child porn. \"AI tools usually detect skin or movement. Some videos have only audio, or the bottom half will be cut off to trick the AI,\" admits Berges Malu, public policy head at ShareChat. A similar problem with AI has been detected on Facebook too. Krishnan tried to report a group called Kochu Sundarikal (Little Pretty One), an English-Malayalam community of 3,000 paedophiles openly discussing child abuse. The AI could not spot a 'community guideline violation' because it was in a vernacular language. Similarly, Ankit Mitra (name changed), 31, a cyber hacker from Ahmedabad, says he recently helped bust a WhatsApp group called Bhabiji ghar pe hai, where 150 paedophiles shared images and links to child porn on the dark web. Despite consultations with social media companies, the government has not mandated accountability or punitive measures for failure to remove or report content.<\/p> <p>The government has banned child porn but is yet to set up a dedicated agency to investigate cases of those who view, distribute and create it. There is a general consensus on the ineffectiveness of moral bans. \"Generally, harm reduction is a more successful approach because even if pornography is banned, people are likely to continue watching (as they have for centuries). Typically, a ban does not stop use, it just moves use into the shadows and stigmatises the behaviour, which is antithetical to the goal of decreasing negative health effects,\" says Kimberly M. Nelson, professor, Boston University, and co-author of the study, 'Pornography is not a public health crisis'. Public shaming or humiliation is often used as a deterrent for crime in China and some American states. Psychiatrists, behaviouralists and even judges are divided on whether this is an effective form of discipline, though it's viewed as a stronger message than moral policing. The justice system, however, needs to be speedy and robust for such punishments to have an impact.<\/p> <p>Experts recommend sex education, so that children know their bodies-and their rights.<\/p> <p>A blind eye is being turned towards sexual education, even though academics argue for its benefits in deterring child abuse. \"Children need to be educated about sex. If they know about their bodies, they knows about their rights,\" says S.K. Khandelwal, head of psychiatry, AIIMS, Delhi. Chennai-based sexologist Prakash Kothari, who has been practising for 48 years, thinks likewise. \"I have seen the age of puberty speed up from 14 years to 11 now. This is largely because of exposure to sexual content through movies, news, songs, social media, chatrooms etc. However, the mind still matures at age 21. This is why it is imperative for schools to educate children about their bodies, to help them understand exploitation,\" says Kothari.<\/p> <p>Arun Kapur, director of Delhi's Vasant Valley School, says, \"Parents need to be parents, not friends. Discipline and awareness about digital safety begins at home. There is only so much schools can do. Most children today are on phones even before they start school,\" says Kapur. Indeed, parents are the first responders here. In the UK, Papaya Parents, a collective of concerned parents who wish to battle phone, porn and internet addiction among their kids, advises being involved with children, having open discussions and clear guidelines on usage. Many also access their kids' social media accounts, and will monitor it till they turn 18. India has no such support group.<\/p> <p>Despite media scrutiny and suggestions for stricter legal measures, creation of, and access to, child pornography has never been simpler. In 1991, when Freddy Peats was arrested for sexually exploiting children at his Goa orphanage, the police discovered 2,305 porn photographs of minor boys engaged in sexual acts with white men and 135 film negatives of child porn in his possession. What took Peats 20 years to achieve can now be done in a few weeks. A search on a dark website reveals 300,000 images of children being forced to engage in sexual acts with other children, children being tortured by adults, being bitten by animals and nude selfies of young schoolgirls and boys. This is the threat of the internet, where the hunter and the hunted exist on the same platform with nothing to distinguish one from the other. With close to 66 million children from India scouring the web every day (according to a 2019 study by the Internet and Mobile Association of India), each one is at risk of becoming a silent victim in an advancing pornography market.<\/p> <p>Perverse patterns<\/p> <p>Child predators often spend weeks building connections with their victims, normalising the watching of porn before manipulating them into making such material themselves<\/p> <p>The cyber grooming of children by predators-the befriending of children online with the explicit intention of later sexual exploitation-is spreading with alarming rapidity in India. And what often goes largely unreported in India is the evolving modus operandi of such predators.<\/p> <p>\"The victims are those who are 'struggling' in some way,\" says Shelja Sen, child psychologist and family therapist. \"They could be lonely, failing in academics, dealing with parental strife, born with a disability, isolated from others their age... these are the kids who are singled out and approached.\" Through a process that involves stalking their victims on social media and spinning a compelling narrative as bait, cyber groomers appear to rely heavily on gaming forums and chatrooms to develop emotional connections with their victims. \"They don't care if the child is rich or poor, urban or rural, male or female. They will look for signs [of vulnerability], such as posts about loneliness or weight issues or health conditions-anything that suggests the child is alienated and craves social connection,\" explains Sunitha Krishnan, co-founder of Prajwala.<\/p> <p>70 per cent of boys in Grade 9 watched 6 porn videos a week on average, according to one estimate.<\/p> <p>This was clearly visible in the case of 14-year-old Heena (name changed). Heena, a student from Lucknow, had often disclosed to other players on Fortnite (an online video game that has a chat window where players can text each other) how miserable she was because her parents were getting a divorce. It was here that an online predator-'Mudita'-found her.<\/p> <p>Illustration by Nilanjan Das<\/p> <p>Mudita later approached Heena on Facebook, and over the weeks that followed, manipulated her into believing they had a great deal in common. Mudita would post about her own parents getting a divorce, and after she found out that Heena enjoyed street food, also began posting photos of chhole bhature, golgappas and kebabs. She was so successful in the deception that it was Heena who messaged her, offering words of comfort. Later, when Mudita introduced her to pornography, Heena accepted it as normal because 'her friend' had shown it to her-a trust that remained unbroken even when Mudita asked Heena to film herself naked. It was only when Heena's mother chanced upon the messages that the dangerous 'friendship' came to light.<\/p> <p>It was Mudita's Facebook account that gave Manoj Sharma-psychiatrist and founder of NIMHANS's social media de-addiction centre in Bengaluru-a look at how much deliberation predators put into their efforts. \"Of the 8-10 children we see per week, invariably, several have been led to watch porn online,\" says Sharma. \"Typically, they are conditioned to porn from an early age-they find nudity to be no big deal. So it doesn't feel exploitative to them [if they were to be] filmed in the same manner,\" says Sharma. \"Everything is available online and can also easily be hidden. This is a big advantage for predators: they hide behind the cloak of their own profile, and behind what children don't share with their parents.\"<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3XWUWJ18TN5SRWB3EUFPZ51TG1TUU5"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"eb84bfc7-99bf-4727-a72b-f85f9eb5626e","work_time_in_seconds":3581,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Praniti","victim_keywords":"(name changed), cherubic, child pornography","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Heena","victim_keywords":"(name changed), child pornography","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Praniti","victim_keywords":"(name changed), cherubic, child pornography","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Heena","victim_keywords":"(name changed), child pornography","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1023049197,"Input.title":"A Syrian colonel is jailed for life in a first torture trial for the Assad regime.

The queue to get in often snaked around the block. But the easygoing residents of our very suburban district were happy to wait, clutching newspapers and umbrellas and chatting in Cantonese. Mak misses that life, those tastes and smells. The Hong Kong-style food she has found in Sydney just doesn\u2019t match up, she says. \u201cThe food here is so much more expensive, and not nearly as authentic.\u201d<\/p> <p>Many of the cafe\u2019s patrons are keen for a taste of their home. Its traditional Chinese characters (different from China\u2019s simplified system of writing) are on signs on the wall. The functional formica tables and stools tell a Hong Kong story, as does the music playing, which includes, Mak tells me, a protest pop song.<\/p> <p>Sitting in the Kowloon Cafe in Sydney\u2019s Chinatown, Mak chooses French toast \u2013 the waitress brings condensed milk to go with it, but Mak prefers maple syrup \u2013 and strong milk tea, also made with condensed milk. Spam also figures heavily on the menu of this resplendently Hongkong-esque venue.<\/p> <p>Sophie Mak will probably never go home. She has been too vocal and too critical of both China\u2019s and Hong Kong\u2019s governments over the years, using Twitter to comment on the unfolding tragedy in her homeland, Hong Kong. With long black hair, a short-sleeved, bright red dress and a surprisingly deep and husky voice, Mak, 24, is a typical Hongkonger: enthusiastic, committed to democracy, and deeply aware of the dangers threatening her home.<\/p> <p>Mak regularly demonstrated in those heady days, before coming to Australia in February 2020 to continue her University of Hong Kong arts\/law degree at the Australian National University. By the time she finished the course a few months later, China, led by the increasingly authoritarian Xi Jinping, had crushed the protests with an extreme national security law. Formally called the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Safe-guarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, it was passed in June by a committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, bypassing the need for Hong Kong\u2019s approval. It killed free speech and freedom of the press, undermined the rule of law, and transformed a once-freewheeling and bumptious society on the edge of China to a place of silence and fear.<\/p> <p>Protests were originally ignited in 2019 by the introduction of an extradition bill, which could have seen some of the territory\u2019s alleged lawbreakers whisked off to the mainland. The demonstrations rapidly built in size and fury until the day when an estimated 2 million marchers \u2013 a good quarter of the population \u2013 took to the streets.<\/p> <p>More than a million mainland Chinese people have moved to Hong Kong since the handover and locals claim that many of them have found plum government and corporate positions, inexorably altering the culture of the territory. Many homegrown companies, too, it\u2019s widely thought, have been taken over by mainlanders. Locals had long quietly feared China\u2019s encroachment, hoping to keep the worst at bay until at least 2047, and possibly beyond, given Hong Kong\u2019s important position as a financial trading hub. But the crackdown came with lightning speed in 2020, and Hong Kong has suffered culturally and financially.<\/p> <p>There had been disquiet in Hong Kong since 1997 when, after a century-and-a-half in control, Britain formally handed the colony back to China, with an agreement that it would retain a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. A Basic Law was introduced to protect freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and provide a certain level of universal suffrage for those five decades. It didn\u2019t quite work out like that.<\/p> <p>These days, in the new Hong Kong, she could be prosecuted and jailed for her words. The likelihood of going home has dwindled to vanishing point, she says. \u201cThe more I do, in regards to human-rights associations, or with interviews even, it\u2019s gotten even more unlikely.\u201d<\/p> <p>Her Twitter account, which has more than 10,000 followers, tells the story. She\u2019s tweeted about the \u201cmass exodus\u201d from Hong Kong, the \u201ccensorship\u201d and the \u201cdraconian\u201d national security law. In January last year she tweeted, \u201cThe government is brazenly purging the entire opposition camp and every last voice of dissent there is. It\u2019s coming for everyone.\u201d<\/p> <p>Mak has worked with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on various projects, including verifying videos alleging excessive police force in Hong Kong as genuine. These days a human rights advocate in exile, Mak misses her old life, the city\u2019s busy streets, brightly lit until late at night, her friends and her family \u2013 and she doesn\u2019t want to talk about them, worried about reprisals.<\/p> <p>They were all horrified by the vague provisions in the new law that prohibit what\u2019s defined as separatism, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with external forces. These elastic terms can encompass all manner of infractions and be punished by lengthy prison sentences, up to life. \u201cIt got me really scared,\u201d Mak says. \u201cThings that are said, things that are posted on social media, they can always use it against you afterwards.\u201d<\/p> <p>A human rights advocate in exile, Sophie Mak is one of the few activists prepared to reveal their name. Credit:Joshua Morris<\/p> <p>Mak remembers sitting in an Airbnb apartment in Canberra on that chilly June day, watching the televised press conference introducing the security law on her laptop, and texting friends in Hong Kong on the encrypted messaging service, Telegram.<\/p> <p>Opposition politicians were jailed for months on end under the national security law \u2013 with no possibility of bail, and often for trivial non-crimes such as communicating with foreign journalists. In July 2020, police arrested eight protesters who held up blank placards at a gathering after the resistance phrase \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d was banned. It\u2019s now illegal to use that sequence of words in Hong Kong \u2013 the authorities consider it an \u201cincitement to secession\u201d.<\/p> <p>From that day, repeating a political slogan could get a protester arrested. Writing a critical article. Singing a protest song. School textbooks with \u201csensitive\u201d content were withdrawn from circulation. Newspaper editors were arrested and journalists fired. Publisher Jimmy Lai, a prominent Beijing critic and enthusiastic democracy supporter, was arrested in August 2020; despite having a British passport, he was determined to stay. He\u2019s still locked up. His Apple Daily newspaper was forced to close and a million copies were printed of the last edition in June 2021: locals queued for hours to buy a copy.<\/p> <p>Hongkongers had long experienced polite police officers, safe streets, a well-run and efficient city and the freedom to express themselves. From mid-2019, police were accused of using excessive force, streets often became a battlefield filled with smoke and shouting, the much-used MTR subway was repeatedly disrupted by demonstrators, and stations and lines were sometimes shut down by police to impede protests.<\/p> <p>We had lived in Jakarta and Bangkok for many years and spent a lot of time reporting from other variously dysfunctional Asian nations. Hong Kong had always seemed like an enclave of democratic values, where residents got cranky about everything from inadequate garbage removal to late buses, where its Independent Commission Against Corruption (set up in the 1970s under British rule) vigorously pursued misconduct, and newspapers published critical (and sometimes scurrilous) stories about government officials and business tycoons.<\/p> <p>Like Mak, I abandoned the city, but I knew long in advance that a departure was inevitable \u2013 I was an expatriate with a long history of dipping in and out of the territory. I hated Beijing\u2019s inexorable takeover of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong had always seemed like an enclave of democratic values, where residents got cranky about everything from inadequate garbage removal to late buses.<\/p> <p>My husband and I lived in Hong Kong for two-and-a-half years until late 2021, our second long stint in the city. I had spent a lot of time there as a child and as an adolescent, and I was fond of the energetic Cantonese people. In 2019, I joined the massive protest marches, fled the tear gas and watched the city split along partisan lines. More than 10,000 protesters were arrested in those tumultuous months. The day the national security law was passed in 2020 was a day of melancholy. We knew Hong Kong would never be the same again.<\/p> <p>Unable to go home, Mak is now working on her master\u2019s degree in international security at the University of Sydney.<\/p> <p>\u201cI never planned to stay when I came here,\u201d she says. \u201cI was planning to leave in May [2020] after my exchange study ended.\u201d She regrets not being able to say goodbye. She never had the chance for a farewell tour of her favourite places, for one last face-to-face talk with her friends; one final hug from her closest relatives.<\/p> <p>On a more personal level, the law sounded a final death knell for me. Constrained by the pandemic, we continued to live in limbo in our 30th-floor apartment in a no-frills block until the summer heat and terror politics drove us out. A friend\u2019s spouse was locked up without bail for many months, no trial date set. Another friend, who had lived in Hong Kong for much of his adult life and who was an outspoken critic of China\u2019s incursions, reluctantly and sorrowfully emigrated to Britain. Reading the local news became a depressing business; so much lost, so many locked up. We finally left for good last December, waving goodbye to the city from Hong Kong\u2019s echoing, empty airport.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s rigid pandemic rules contributed to the city\u2019s massive upheaval. Hotel-room quarantine for up to three weeks \u2013 and the regular banning of flights from various airlines \u2013 kept residents effectively confined in the tiny territory. With far less at stake than home-grown Hongkongers, many of the city\u2019s shifting population of expatriates began to leave too, often despite a reluctance to ditch well-paid jobs and the cosmopolitan life.<\/p> <p>Hongkongers have flooded into the UK, which has flung open its doors, and to a lesser extent to Canada, the US and Australia. Last year, 104,000 people with British National (Overseas) status \u2013 those born there before the handover to China, and their dependants \u2013 applied to relocate to Britain. Closer to home, about 8800 temporary skilled, temporary graduate and student visa holders based in Australia became eligible for new permanent resident visas in a specialised stream that opened in March this year.<\/p> <p>Dismayed by the crackdown and the erosion of civil liberties, many thousands of Hongkongers made the painful decision to emigrate and start new lives abroad. The city\u2019s airport became the backdrop for an ongoing procession of tearful farewells.<\/p> <p>Then, in June 2020, the national security law pushed Hong Kong from fury to fear, crushing the city\u2019s protests. Although it remained largely untouched by COVID-19 until early this year, the scourge provided the government with an excuse to ban social gatherings \u2013 which, of course, included protests.<\/p> <p>Mak, like many of her compatriots who have recently settled in Australia, was keen to see Revolution of Our Times, a documentary about the Hong Kong protests. Hongkongers lined up for the premiere screening of the film at the Palace Norton cinema in Sydney\u2019s Leichhardt in April. Cantonese chatter bubbled up as friends were greeted and seats were found.<\/p> <p>As the credits rolled, applause rang out in the darkness and a lone voice called out in Cantonese: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201d<\/p> <p>Directed by Kiwi Chow, the emotional film is about the protesters \u2013 mostly young \u2013 who marched and organised, who communicated with each other via Telegram, who organised themselves into groups of medics, journalists, drivers and front-line \u201cwarriors\u201d, who defended themselves with umbrellas, who picked up tear-gas canisters and hurled them back at the police, who threw Molotov cocktails, who occupied university campuses and who fought for their liberty and for their future for months on end.<\/p> <p>As the credits rolled, applause rang out in the darkness and a lone voice called out in Cantonese: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201d As one, the Sydney audience echoed the words: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201d<\/p> <p>Tickets to see the documentary in cinemas across Australia sold out at warp speed, fuelled by social media. More than 6500 had gone when the team decided to increase the number of screenings. And then it bumped it up again. And again. In Taiwan, the film won an award and broke a box-office record in its first week of screening.<\/p> <p>Mak saw the documentary in Sydney, and thought it a strong piece of filmmaking. She sat surrounded by Hongkongers, reliving those adrenaline-fuelled days. \u201cA lot of people were weeping,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a powerful reminder of all the sacrifice.\u201d<\/p> <p>The clever and dogged protesters were always determined to make their point, mostly peacefully. In August 2019, tens of thousands joined hands to form an almost 50-kilometre-long human chain of resistance that wound through the city. One morning a month later, I noticed that the footpaths leading to the Fortress Hill subway station had been completely covered with photocopies of a picture of the face of Junius Ho, a much-disliked pro-Beijing legislator. Commuters had to tread on his face if they wanted to ride on the subway. Lines from China\u2019s national anthem, such as \u201cArise ye who refuse to be slaves\u201d, and quotes from Mao Tse Tung were co-opted for a different cause.<\/p> <p>During the 2019 protests, photocopies of a picture of pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho lined footpaths leading to a Hong Kong subway station, forcing commuters to tread on his face.

In early 2021, Beijing tried to stem the flood of emigration by withdrawing recognition of Hong Kong\u2019s British National (Overseas) passports as valid documents, making it extremely difficult for many to withdraw their retirement money from the city\u2019s mandatory pension system.<\/p> <p>Daniel Chau* is nearly 60, but looks far younger, and wears a long-sleeved shirt, a vest and round-framed glasses. He says he was inspired by the Revolution documentary to do more to help Hong-kongers fleeing their homeland. The scrapbooks he has brought to the nondescript cafe in Sydney\u2019s northern suburbs where we meet tell a story of sorrow and remembrance. A lawyer by training, he is careful and circumspect,<\/p> <p>discussing the fire and passion of the desperate protests as a coffee machine burbles away in the background.<\/p> <p>Like me, he and his wife arrived in Sydney at the end of last year. His elderly mother did not want to come with them to Australia; she couldn\u2019t face the exhaustion of starting again in a strange land.<\/p> <p>So now just Chau, his wife and their adult son and daughter live in Australia. \u201cThe reason we decided to come back is the political system is breaking down,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer myself and I see the legal system in Hong Kong is seriously breaking down because it\u2019s turning from the rule of law to the rule of man. It\u2019s basically what the [Chinese] Communist government decides to do, the Hong Kong government follows suit.\u201d<\/p> <p>He first emigrated to Australia in the 1980s, returning to Hong Kong a decade or so later, lured by the economic reforms then underway in China and the hope that democracy was on the front foot across Asia. Over the years, his disquiet slowly built. Then, in 2014, Hongkongers from the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d \u2013 so called for their chosen shield against police pepper-spray attacks \u2013 took to the streets to demand the right to have a say in choosing their leaders.<\/p> <p>Beijing, it had been decided, would effectively select the candidates for the position of Hong Kong chief executive, even though, according to the Basic Law, \u201cthe ultimate aim\u201d was for that role to be filled by \u201cuniversal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee\u201d. Beijing proclaimed candidates for chief executive had to \u201clove the country [China], and love Hong Kong\u201d, and the promise of some degree of universal suffrage began to recede over the distant Chinese horizon.<\/p> <p>I remember interviewing children (some still in school uniform) and passionate youngsters in their blockaded encampment on a stinkingly hot thoroughfare in central Hong Kong\u2019s Admiralty district in 2014; we were surrounded by gleaming skyscrapers, at one of a number of protest sites. An hour in the relentless heat rising from the bitumen nearly killed me, but the protesters sat it out, coming and going as needs demanded, distributing bottles of water and singing solidarity songs. Some sat peacefully doing their homework.<\/p> <p>I went back again and again; their determination remained undiminished. They stayed put for weeks, finally retreating in the face of increasing violence and sheer exhaustion.<\/p> <p>A photo of a poster showing demonstrators in heavy rain, from the scrapbook of Daniel Chau, who left the territory for Australia. Credit:Joshua Morris<\/p> <p>Chau\u2019s swirling fears for Hong Kong\u2019s future began to coalesce with these protests in 2014 and firmed as time went on. \u201cAll this fear is realised now,\u201d he says, adding that he feels cheated. He had returned to Hong Kong in the 1990s, comforted by the freedoms guaranteed in the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy agreed to by China. His trust was misplaced.<\/p> <p>In 2019, with democracy protests in Hong Kong growing again and China\u2019s grip tightening, Chau\u2019s family, Australian citizens since their first time here, bought an apartment in northern Sydney \u2013 an escape route for when life in Hong Kong became unbearable.<\/p> <p>The people of Hong Kong are almost always civil. During my time living there, I never saw a bar fight or a brawl. They are usually incredibly law-abiding \u2013 lost wallets are usually returned, cash intact, with the finders going to great lengths to track down the owners. It\u2019s one of the safest cities in the world: I felt far safer walking the streets of Hong Kong than I ever have walking at night in Sydney. Hongkongers don\u2019t push and shove; they even queue quietly to get on the subway.<\/p> <p>But they hold their freedoms dear, and in 2019 and 2020 they demonstrated a rock-solid determination to hang on to their liberty. For this, many were happy to break the law. An estimated one million citizens took to the streets on June 9, 2019, a big slice of the city\u2019s 7-million-plus population, many wearing white, marching to make their loyalties clear \u2013 they wanted no part of mainland rule.<\/p> <p>I walked with them and their passion was evident. Their sheer weight of numbers was almost unstoppable, but the marchers were eventually met by police wielding batons and pepper spray.<\/p> <p>A week later, they marched again, and this time as many as 2 million residents took to the streets, incensed by the police opposition and galvanised by the repression they feared was looming menacingly just over the horizon from the northern stronghold of Beijing.<\/p> <p>We smiled and chatted as we shuffled along, the press of people preventing any show of speed or sudden movement. Many marchers were wearing black, mourning one of their own. The colour remained the favoured shade of protester wear for long months; eventually, the increasingly bellicose police were likely to stop and search any youngster seen wearing black.<\/p> <p>\u201cA youngster was shot on the street. So we thought, \u2018We have to go; it\u2019s time to go.\u2019 \u201d<\/p> <p>Sophie Mak was somewhere in the press of regular marchers in the 2019 protests, as was Daniel Chau, appalled by the speed of the crackdown in Hong Kong.<\/p> <p>By the day of the handover anniversary, on July 1, feelings were running high and a splinter group of furious protesters broke into Hong Kong\u2019s parliament (known as LegCo) and spray-painted slogans on the walls. They retreated of their own accord, leaving money for drinks taken from vending machines.<\/p> <p>\u201cAfter the extradition bill we see police brutality, not rule of law, no due process, people arrested, people beaten up,\u201d Chau says, remembering the turmoil. \u201cThe ammunition they were using was escalating in force. Tear gas, rubber bullets \u2026 people got hurt. They were using water cannons. Finally live ammunition; a youngster was shot on the street. So we thought, \u2018We have to go; it\u2019s time to go.\u2019 \u201d<\/p> <p>Loading<\/p> <p>But the Chaus remained in Hong Kong, held back by family ties as the fury of 2019 spilled over into 2020. \u201cThat is a very difficult decision. My in-laws don\u2019t want to go. My mum doesn\u2019t want to go. They are old, they don\u2019t want to go and live in a foreign place.\u201d The protests roiled on, diminished by the spectre of the pandemic and the consequent restrictions, but no less passionate.<\/p> <p>In early June 2020, many thousands defied a government ban and gathered in Victoria Park for the city\u2019s annual Tiananmen Square commemoration, the only one held anywhere in China. They turned up to remember the fallen of Tiananmen, and to underline Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China.<\/p> <p>I stood in the crowd that day, watching the massed bodies, the candles and the flowers, the masked faces, the passionate speeches, the sea of hands held up, fingers spread to indicate the protesters\u2019 five demands: withdrawal of the extradition bill, an inquiry into alleged police brutality, the retraction of the \u201crioters\u201d classification for protesters, amnesty for arrested protesters and universal suffrage. There was a warm feeling of shared hopes and aims. The locals who organised that event were later arrested.<\/p> <p>In June 2020, thousands gathered for the annual memorial vigil in Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Park to mark the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Credit:Getty Images<\/p> <p>A year later, in 2021, Tiananmen commemoration was all but dead, its spirit killed by fear of the national security law. Police officers roamed Victoria Park, much of it barred to pedestrians. I only saw a handful of protesters that day, including one elderly and undaunted woman known as Grandma Wong, wearing a face mask patterned with Union Jacks and marching across a street in nearby Causeway Bay, flanked by police officers.<\/p> <p>Four brave youngsters stood on a footpath, masks on, eyes down, holding up a black banner with the date of the Tiananmen uprising. One elderly woman in thongs, her face obscured by a large mask and sunglasses, held up a placard of newspaper cuttings with a photo of Tiananmen\u2019s famed \u201cTank man\u201d, a demonstrator who stood peacefully in the path of the tanks. Police roamed the streets, looking for malefactors, but by then, Hong Kong\u2019s rebellious demonstrations had been almost entirely crushed.<\/p> <p>The Chaus were dismayed by the introduction of the restrictive security law: it was another big push for them to leave Hong Kong. And yet they lingered. \u201cTo relocate a family is not that simple,\u201d Chau says. \u201cYou have to prepare for assets to be relocated, funds to be transferred. Qualifications to be admitted. You have to prepare parents, so they accept one day you are going.\u201d<\/p> <p>The family has solid reasons to be wary of Communist China. Daniel Chau\u2019s parents were born in Macau, then a Portuguese territory adjacent to China, and they migrated to Hong Kong in the 1960s. His uncle had a post in mainland China. During the terror years of the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards found a letter sent to this uncle by his sister, Chau\u2019s mother, in Macau. They accused him of liaising with a foreign power \u2013 considered an appalling sin. His uncle took his own life to protect his family. \u201cWe know what the Communists can do, how crazy they can become,\u201d Chau says.<\/p> <p>\u201cMost Hong Kong people don\u2019t need independence. Hong Kong people just want what was promised in the Basic Law. It was a social contract.\u201d<\/p> <p>His family, already split by the suicide, have been divided again by China\u2019s takeover of Hong Kong more than 20 years too early. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has taken a toll.<\/p> <p>\u201cMost Hong Kong people don\u2019t need independence,\u201d he says. \u201cHong Kong people just want what was promised in the Basic Law. It was a social contract. \u2018You promised us this; we decide to come here and work, and make this society prosper. You promised us. You cannot take it back after 20 years.\u2019 \u201d He pauses and shakes his head. \u201cI was na\u00efve to believe in the promises of the CCP.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nathan Wong*, a 20-something finance student, was never an activist, but he joined a few marches in 2019 and was unhappy with the direction Hong Kong was taking. The protests grew and the crackdowns spread, and the idea of leaving Hong Kong became increasingly attractive.<\/p> <p>He finally left in early 2020 after his family spent a month wrestling with difficult choices. \u201cAt the time everyone in Hong Kong was so depressed,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was social injustice, the national security law. I have no regrets coming here.\u201d<\/p> <p>It took time for his parents to consider the circumstances and decide what was best for him and best for the family. Wong himself had few doubts. \u201cHonestly, everything started with the extradition bill,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a youngster, I didn\u2019t see a future for myself in Hong Kong.\u201d<\/p> <p>In his immediate family, though, opinions have been divided. His parents, still in their birthplace of Hong Kong with his younger brother, continue to call it home. His businessman father has dealings with mainland China and was more supportive than Wong of both the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, and more concerned about the economic effect of the protests.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe had no problem with the extradition bill,\u201d Wong says. His mother, a housewife, sympathised more with the protests, he says, but was increasingly concerned about the potential impact of the unrest on her son. Eventually, a family consensus was reached and Wong was on a flight to Sydney. He expects to stay in Australia and that his parents, probably, will stay where they are.<\/p> <p>Some Hong Kong families are united in sympathy for the protests, but are resigned to difficult geographic separations. A fresh-faced young woman in her early 20s with long hair and glasses, Vanessa Chan* expects the upheaval in her homeland to divide her family along generational lines, probably forever.<\/p> <p>Like Wong, she left Hong Kong in 2020 to study here, and recently finished her health degree course at a regional university. Australia\u2019s decision to provide a path to permanent residency has encouraged her to settle here, but she has had difficulty finding a permanent full-time job in her field where she lives and may have to uproot again and move to another Australian city.<\/p> <p>Loading<\/p> <p>Chan\u2019s parents still live in Hong Kong and have encouraged both Chan and her sister, now in the US, to stay away, far from their home. They want Chan to remain in Australia and eventually have children here \u2013 grandchildren they\u2019re likely to see only rarely. \u201cThey do not like the Chinese party,\u201d she says. \u201cThey always said, \u2018If you have a chance, just emigrate.\u2019<\/p> <p>\u201cMe and most of my friends here have decided to stay, and we\u2019re trying to figure a way to earn a living,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just can\u2019t imagine our future back in Hong Kong any more. So we\u2019ve been trying to figure out another way to live our lives. And also for the next generation.\u201d<\/p> <p>* Not their real names.<\/p> <p>To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.<\/p> <p>The best of Good Weekend delivered to your inbox every Saturday morning.

trial and torture of Zimbabwe\u2019s Joanah Mamombe co...","Input.publish_date":"2020-10-22 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>On 13 May 2020, a group of young people held a peaceful demonstration in Harare demanding accountability on Covid-19 resources received by the government of Zimbabwe from different countries, organisations and local stakeholders.<\/p> <p>On their way from the protest march, three women \u2014 Cecilia Chimbiri, Joanah Mamombe and Netsai Marova \u2014 members of Zimbabwe\u2019s biggest opposition party, the MDC Alliance, were arrested at a Zimbabwe Republic Police roadblock.<\/p> <p>They managed to notify some of their comrades about the arrest and police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, confirmed to two newspapers, the state-owned Herald and Newsday, a privately owned newspaper, their arrest for organising and participating in an illegal protest.<\/p> <p>On hearing of the arrest, the three women\u2019s lawyers rushed to Harare central police station, but police there claimed they did not have the women in their custody.<\/p> <p>The lawyers and the women\u2019s colleagues went to police stations in Harare searching for them, but were given the same response: \u201cWe do not have them in our custody.\u201d<\/p> <p>It became clear to everyone who understands the methods of the state that the women had been abducted. The police spokesperson also distanced himself from his earlier admission that they had arrested the three women.<\/p> <p>Fortunately, the car they had been driving on the day of the protest was found parked at Harare central police station, so we knew the police were lying.<\/p> <p>Zimbabweans took to Twitter and other media platforms to call for the immediate release of the women, undoubtedly victims of enforced disappearance. There has been a systematic and widespread use of abductions and enforced disappearance by the state on dissidents.<\/p> <p>On 15 May, two nights after their disappearance, the three women were found dumped on a roadside near Bindura about 86km from Harare, traumatised and seriously injured. They were admitted to hospital for treatment. Zimbabweans were relieved when we heard they had been found. We thought their troubles were over, but it seems they were just beginning.<\/p> <p>The women narrated their ordeal and in tears explained how after their arrest they had been abducted from police custody by armed men and taken to a forest where for two days they were physically and sexually assaulted and forced to perform humiliating and degrading acts such as drinking one another\u2019s urine.<\/p> <p>While still in hospital, on 26 May, they were charged with \u201cinciting public violence\u201d. A magistrate went to the hospital to hear the matter and a kangaroo court-style hearing was held at their hospital bedsides. Zimbabweans were outraged by the brazen continuation of the victimisation of these women, who had already been tortured. They were granted bail for that charge 29 May.<\/p> <p>On 8 June they were discharged from hospital to finish their recovery at home. As they were attempting to pick up their lives after the traumatic experiences, just two days after they were discharged, on 10 June, they were arrested again and this time charged with faking abduction. They were sent to Chikurubi maximum prison only to be granted bail by the high court more than two weeks later on 26 June.<\/p> <p>It is clear that the state is hellbent on forcing the MDC Three to face trial despite their mental health challenges. Everything that is happening to them is not because they broke any laws, but persecution for daring to question the government on how it used Covid-19 donations.<\/p> <p>The bail conditions barred them from using social media, they were to report to police three times a week and they had to surrender their passports and pay Z$10,000 (about $100).<\/p> <p>They were also banned from talking to the media. The media ban has meant that the world has no access to the finer details of the lengths to which Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government has gone to abuse the women. There were rumours that all three were struggling with depression, anxiety and other stress- and trauma-induced conditions. Through it all, they observed their bail conditions religiously. They have not given any interviews, they have not participated in public gatherings and they have been reporting to the police three times weekly as stipulated.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, that has not prevented the state from victimising them further.<\/p> <p>On 4 September, Mamombe had a psychological breakdown which saw her admitted to a mental institution. She was diagnosed with anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.<\/p> <p>While in hospital she missed a court hearing for her ongoing trial of faking an abduction. Her lawyers explained to the magistrate that she was in hospital and therefore could not attend the hearing, but the magistrate would have none of it. On 15 September, police brandishing an arrest warrant descended on Mamombe and forcibly discharged her from hospital in her nightwear, despite pleas from her doctors to allow her to continue treatment.<\/p> <p>On 24 September, to our disbelief and shock, a magistrate by the name of Bianca Makwande ordered that Mamombe be sent back to Chikurubi maximum prison for 14 days on the pretext that she had to be assessed by two state psychiatrists to see if she could stand trial. She was housed in the mental health section of Chikurubi maximum prison where the sickest members of the country are imprisoned. This is where the criminally insane are housed.<\/p> <p>It is reported that on the day she was admitted they tried to inject her with an unknown substance, but she violently protested until they let her go. I believe the government put her there in a bid to drive her insane and thus have an excuse to commit her to a mental asylum.<\/p> <p>Mamombe was released through a high court order on 7 October, but after having already spent 13 days in prison. The assessments by the doctors at a hearing held on 22 October 2020 indicate that Mamombe is not ready for trial and needs medical attention.<\/p> <p>When I heard the news I believed it was good news, but unbeknown to everyone the state had something up its sleeve. Instead of waiting until Mamombe is well enough to stand trial, they say they now want to separate the trials of the MDC Three by trying Mamombe separately from her co-accused. This seems like a clear attempt to frustrate Mamombe further and to isolate her from the support and solidarity she shares with her co-accused. It also ignores the fact that the other two victims are also struggling with anxiety, depression and other mental health issues.<\/p> <p>In December 2019, in the case of the State vs former Minister Prisca Mupfumira who is facing corruption charges involving theft of $95-million in pensioners\u2019 funds, Prisca\u2019s lawyer told the court that she was not mentally fit for trial. A psychiatrist had recommended that she be given three months to recover. The court granted her request and till today, she is free.<\/p> <p>It is clear that the state is hellbent on forcing the MDC Three to face trial despite their mental health challenges. Everything that is happening to them is not because they broke any laws, but persecution for daring to question the government on how it used Covid-19 donations.<\/p> <p>It is important that the world takes an interest in the case of these three women, victims of torture, enforced disappearance, persecution, grave forms of sexual violence, imprisonment and other inhuman acts; all crimes against humanity, according to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Article 7.<\/p> <p>Today, Friday 23 October, the court will give its ruling.

His approval rating was over 80 per cent at the height of the pandemic in April and May this year, with Johnson, Trudeau and L\u00f3pez Obrador in the low 60s, while Trump, Macron and Abe all failed to reach 50 per cent. The 2019 elections gave him a second term with a commanding majority of Lok Sabha seats. At the same time, Modi\u2019s record towards his country\u2019s minorities\u2014imposing martial law on Kashmir, excluding Muslims from the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act, quietly tolerating an epidemic of lynchings, burnings and beatings of Muslims and Dalits\u2014has been qualitatively more brutal than that of Bolsonaro or Trump. How should we account for the Modi phenomenon? The starting point of Kapil Komireddi\u2019s Malevolent Republic is that Modi should not be seen as an aberration: that would be \u2018a self-comforting lie\u2019. Instead, Komireddi\u2014a freelance journalist from Hyderabad, now based in the West\u2014offers three reasons for his rise.<\/p> <p>First, Malevolent Republic points to decades of Congress Party failings\u2014above all, the corruption, nepotism, authoritarianism and greed of its ruling family. Although Nehru and Gandhi are absolved, from the 1960s the party became \u2018a sump for Nehru\u2019s parasitical progeny to luxuriate in\u2019. The first half of the book is a ruthless chronological accounting of Congress misdeeds, as leader after leader is excoriated in the run up to Modi: \u2018Erosion\u2019, \u2018Surrender\u2019, \u2018Decadence\u2019, \u2018Dissolution\u2019, run the chapter headings. Nehru\u2019s daughter Indira displayed \u2018despotic impulses\u2019, using Congress \u2018as a laboratory to test her will\u2019, while her son Sanjay lacked even a \u2018residue of democratic inclination\u2019, as exemplified in the slum-clearance and sterilization campaigns he ran during the 1975\u201377 period of Emergency Rule. Millions of people lost their homes as entire districts were bulldozed in Sanjay\u2019s \u2018beautification\u2019 projects, while millions of poor and vulnerable men were dragged under the knife to meet his \u2018family-planning\u2019 targets. Dissenters, defenders of democratic rights, trade unionists, socialists, were imprisoned without charge, the press was heavily censored, foreign journalists expelled and Sanjay glorified by the media.<\/p> <p>After the blowback from Indira\u2019s military assault on the Sikhs\u2019 Golden Temple\u2014she was assassinated in 1984 by her own Sikh bodyguards\u2014her other son, Rajiv, initiated his reign with a pogrom orchestrated by local Congress leaders. Three thousand Sikhs were killed in Delhi, police even disarming Sikh areas before the mob marched in\u2014setting a precedent, Komireddi notes, for the slaughter of Muslims that took place in Gujarat under Modi in 2002. It was Rajiv who ordered that the gates of Ayodhya be opened, allowing Hindu nationalists to lay the foundations for a future temple inside the Babri Mosque. When Muslim leaders protested, Rajiv appeased them by banning Salman Rushdie\u2019s Satanic Verses, having already sabotaged Muslim women\u2019s rights in the Shah Bano case. After Rajiv\u2019s assassination\u2014blowback again: having sent Indian troops into Sri Lanka, he was killed by a Tamil suicide bomber\u2014the new Congress leader, Narasimha Rao, cultivated ties with the bjp, staying silent as the Babri Mosque was destroyed. The Congress Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh, is denounced by Komireddi as a \u2018subcontinental Pinochet\u2019 for his counter-insurgency against the Naxalites and his harsh neoliberal measures, cutting subsidies and handing land over to foreign corporations. Rapid economic growth was accompanied by rising inequality. Demoralized by decades of Congress betrayals, unshackled by Rao and Singh\u2019s neoliberal reforms from Nehruvian ideals of self-restraint, the expanding Hindu middle class was ready to see in the violence of Ayodhya and its follow-ups \u2018a self-empowering, even redemptive, message\u2019.<\/p> <p>Second, Malevolent Republic turns upon India\u2019s \u2018secular historians\u2019 and public intellectuals. Romila Thapar, author of the renowned Penguin History of India, Volume One and many other works on early Indian history, is a particular target. According to Komireddi, these scholars\u2019 \u2018well-intentioned sanitization of the past\u2019 failed to supply an adequate account of the Persian and Moghul imperial invasions of northern India and the centuries of Muslim rule. In the first decades after Independence, he argues, these intellectuals squandered the chance to provide (Hindu) Indians with a forthright narrative of their \u2018ravaged\u2019 heritage\u2014the great mosques built from shattered temple fragments\u2014that could have reconciled them to their \u2018harrowing past\u2019 and allowed a mature detachment from it. Instead, Thapar and her colleagues \u2018papered over the gruesome deeds of the invaders with nice-nellyisms\u2019, preferring to dwell on their cultural achievements. School textbooks presented an idyllic picture of medieval India in which Muslims and Hindus coexisted in harmony, shattered only by the arrival of the British. But the Muslim encounter left a \u2018deep wound\u2019, Komireddi argues. The euphemization of Moghul rule by Thapar and her colleagues had \u2018infantilized Indians\u2019, rendering them susceptible to \u2018the piffle of Hindu nationalists\u2019 who seized the chance to \u2018weaponize history\u2019, portraying Muslims as insensitive to innocent Hindus\u2019 wounded feelings. This, according to Malevolent Republic, provides the second precondition for Modi\u2019s rise: \u2018The confusion of a country that deferred the task of dealing sincerely with its wounded past was ripe for exploitation\u2019.<\/p> <p>Third, Komireddi argues, big-business backing\u2014from the Tatas to the Ambani brothers\u2014and praise from such eminent scholars as Columbia\u2019s Jagdish Bhagwati or Gurcharan Das, Harvard-educated author of India Unbound, were crucial to the bjp\u2019s success. \u2018Intellectuals and industrialists\u2019 polished Modi\u2019s image as a \u2018technocratic modernizer\u2019, celebrated his \u2018vision\u2019 and ability to get things done. And India\u2019s \u2018shameless elites were easily co-opted to pimp for him, asking only for a commitment to the market in return\u2019. Foreign investors, diplomats and politicians made the pilgrimage to Modi\u2019s capital in Gandhinagar for his trade fairs when he was chief minister of Gujarat, from 2001\u201314. Although Gujarat\u2019s growth was accompanied by low social mobility, it was widely presented as the development model of India, with perfect roads, electricity and clean water. Support from the West was equally fulsome, and the 2002 Gujarati massacre soon forgotten. Before the 2014 election, Time magazine listed Modi as one of the world\u2019s most influential leaders, Cameron put on an honour guard for him, Hollande organized a boat ride on the Seine, Obama offered flattery. Hence \u2018there wasn\u2019t a shadow of resistance as Narendra Modi stormed Delhi in the summer of 2014\u2019.<\/p> <p>The second half of Malevolent Republic covers Modi\u2019s record in office. A series of short thematic chapters explore the Modi personality cult (3d holographic projectors beaming his image into villages without electricity); the monstrously bungled \u2018de-monetization\u2019 policy; the rise of cow vigilantes and escalation of anti-Muslim violence; and the assertion of bjp influence across India\u2019s institutions, from the Reserve Bank of India to the universities and Supreme Court. The treatment here is more journalistic; much of the material will be familiar to readers of the international press. On Kashmir and on foreign policy, however, Komireddi emerges as a hard-line hawk. He commends Modi for cutting an \u2018imposing figure on the world stage\u2019, \u2018confidently projecting Delhi as a rival to Beijing\u2019 and \u2018translating his muscular attitude into action\u2019 by sending troops into Bhutan in 2017 to block a Chinese road-building project. He then dismisses him for being insufficiently tough when the Bhutan invasion \u2018collapsed into a desperate face-saving exercise\u2019 after Washington declined to send reinforcements. Above all, the book is suffused with hostility to Pakistan\u2014a \u2018monument to majoritarian bigotry\u2019, gripped by \u2018neurotic nationalism\u2019, ruled by \u2018vultures\u2019. Alone of the many leaders Komireddi discusses, Bhutto, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister in the 1970s, is disparagingly referred to as \u2018Zulfi\u2019 at every point.<\/p> <p>What explains Malevolent Republic\u2019s hyper-aggressive regional-policy line, apparently out-Modi-ing Modi? The answer may lie in Komireddi\u2019s cursus as a journalist. He owes a major debt, he explains, to the mentorship of David Frum, the neoconservative Canadian-American publicist best known for coining the \u2018axis of evil\u2019 slogan for Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union address. In 2009, Frum recruited Komireddi, fresh out of us law school and without a clear idea of what he wanted to do, and funded him to tour Pakistan to produce a 10-part series for the Frum Forum website, under the title \u2018Pakistan: Anatomy of a Failed State\u2019. Frum\u2019s editorializing sets the tone: \u2018India\u2019s success at forging a nationality out of its diversity stood as a towering repudiation of the very idea of Pakistan\u2019\u2014\u2018Pakistan could not succeed unless India failed.\u2019 Or again: \u2018The terrorism with which we contend has its origins in Pakistan as much as in the Arab Middle East. Our friend Kapil Komireddi has returned from traveling inside Pakistan . . .\u2019 Also in 2009, Komireddi\u2014presumably with Frum\u2019s help\u2014published a \u2018stand up to China\u2019 piece in Foreign Policy (\u2018Time for India to play hardball with China\u2019) and a Guardian opinion column on Kashmir: \u2018Over 60 arduous years, India has integrated radically diverse regions under the banner of a pluralistic nationalism. Its failure to achieve that in Kashmir is largely due to Pakistan.\u2019<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3MQY1YVHS5Z4BLTVVJOOOWED8P32BE"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":424,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1975.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"slum-clearance, sterilization, Emergency Rule","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1975.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"slum-clearance, sterilization, Emergency Rule","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":949256607,"Input.title":"History Revisited: Sit-down strike at Electric Boat was a Connecticut first","Input.publish_date":"2020-09-29 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Beginning in the mid-1930s, organized labor workers throughout the country were bringing attention to their work grievances by employing a new tactic called the \u201csit-down strike.\u201d This strike method entailed workers ceasing work and refusing to leave the worksite.<\/p> <p>The philosophy behind this (unauthorized) occupation of worksite was the belief it would restrict the company from hiring replacement workers, referred to as strike-breakers, and it would also inhibit the company from moving equipment to transfer production to another work location.<\/p> <p>The Electric Boat Company in Groton was the first company in Connecticut to have been the subject of a \u201csit-down strike\u201d and certainly was the subject of a great deal of attention because of the company\u2019s contracts for building submarines for the United States government.<\/p> <p>Over a period of a week and a half in January 1937, workers at the Electric Boat Company, represented by a labor organization named the Employees\u2019 Association, negotiated a new working agreement with the company. In balloting to either accept or reject the agreement, a total of 1,294 of the 1,961 company employees eligible voted. By an almost two to one margin, 824 to 418, workers voted to accept the new agreement.<\/p> <p>Just prior to the beginning of the negotiations between the Employees\u2019 Association and the company, representatives of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America, an affiliate of the Committee for Industrial Organization based in Camden, N.J., came to Groton with intentions of organizing workers to be represented by the IUMSWA. Although there was some interest by about 150 company workers in joining the IUMSWA, the vote of Jan. 29 by the members of the Employees\u2019 Association to accept the new working agreement also was regarded as the official establishment of the Association as the sole collective bargaining agency for the non-supervisory workforce at the company.<\/p> <p>Officials of the IUMSWA and workers at the Groton plant who had desired to have the IUMSWA represent them, continued their organizing efforts. Representatives of the IUMSWA who met with officials of the company were told in no uncertain terms that the company recognized the Employees\u2019 Association as the bargaining unit for the workers and that they would not negotiate with the IUMSWA.<\/p> <p>One shipyard worker, (reportedly) conducting union activities while at work by encouraging employees to join the IUMSWA organization, was discharged by the company for \u201cloafing.\u201d<\/p> <p>The combination of the two events described above caused the leaders of the IUMSWA to call for a \u201csit-down\u201d strike by the workers who were supportive of joining that organization.<\/p> <p>On Jan. 23, a group of approximately 110 workers stopped work and refused to leave the shipyard. Company officials advised the employees that they were discharged from their jobs and told to depart company property.<\/p> <p>\u201cStriking\u201d employees refused to leave the shipyard until the company permitted shipyard workers to vote on accepting the IUMSWA as their recognized bargaining unit and also demanded the reinstatement of the employee who had engaged in union activities.<\/p> <p>The company subsequently contacted the state police and filed a complaint against the \u201csit-down\u201d strikers for trespassing.<\/p> <p>State police immediately began the process of obtaining arrest warrants for the \u201ctrespassing\u201d workers.<\/p> <p>In the interim, IUMSWA officials and other workers, sympathetic to the strikers, were providing the \u201csit-downers\u201d with food and cigarettes, passing them over the company\u2019s security fencing.<\/p> <p>In the early morning hours on Feb. 24, after obtaining arrest warrants, state police entered the shipyard and arrested 107 strikers for trespassing. The strikers were brought to the barracks in Groton, where they were photographed and fingerprinted. They were then taken to the Groton district court where they were released without bond by Groton Town Court Judge Charles F. Willard.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, Judge Willard was also an employee of the Electric Boat Company. He subsequently recused himself to participate in the trials of the strikers.<\/p> <p>After release from court, the \u201csit-downers\u201d and other union sympathizers established picket lines at the company. A large contingency of state police officers was assigned to monitor and control the strikers.<\/p> <p>IUMSWA officials pursued various avenues in an attempt to pressure company officials to negotiate with them; however, the company was steadfast in its stance that there was nothing to negotiate as the workers were already represented by the Employees\u2019 Association and the \u201csit-downers\u201d were no longer employees of the company.<\/p> <p>Union officials met with Gov. Wilbur Cross to protest the fact that state police, and not local police, had evicted the strikers from company property and were being assigned to strike duty at the company. To the surprise of the union officials, Gov. Cross jumped to his feet and, while pointing his finger at the spokesmen for the strikers, declared with great emphasis, \u201cthere will be no sit-down strikes in Connecticut.\u201d<\/p> <p>The union subsequently filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.<\/p> <p>In June 1938, more than 17 months after the \u201csit-down\u201d strike had begun, the NLRB ruled against the company and ordered the reinstatement of and back pay for all of the workers who had engaged in the \u201csit-down\u201d strike. The NLRB also ordered reinstatement and back pay for the employee whose employment had been terminated after engaging in union activities on company property.<\/p> <p>Most of the strikers who had been terminated for the \u201csit-down\u201d strike had either already been reemployed by the company or had found other employment prior to the NLRB ruling.<\/p> <p>The NLRB ruling also ordered the company to disestablish the Employees\u2019 Association, the collective bargaining agency for the workers, on the grounds that the company had dominated the association. The company complied with the orders of the NLRB and workers subsequently affiliated with another labor organization.<\/p> <p>In the late 1960s through the late 1980s, Electric Boat was no stranger to labor union actions, including several lengthy strikes, lasting well over one year. Most of the strikes revolved around issues relating to salary, work conditions and union contract language. One interesting labor action occurred in June 1968 when trade union employees participated in a two-week \u201cwildcat\u201d strike (a strike held without union authorization or approval) to express their displeasure with the company\u2019s suspending an officer of union locals for (reportedly) encouraging several workers to refuse to work in protest of the company\u2019s hiring workers at its facility in Quincy, Mass.<\/p> <p>As is the case in many labor related disputes ending in strike actions, results often end in hurting either or both the workers and the company. During lengthy strikes, workers lose earnings and benefits that would have been available while they were on strike and the company experiences reductions in production affecting their profit margins.<\/p> <p>Oftentimes, strikes result in long term friction between the workers and company.<\/p> <p>In today\u2019s world, most unions use strike actions as a last resort in settling disagreements with companies. Peter E. Baker, president of the Metal Trades Council of New London County, recent expressed the new philosophy in this way: \u201cA strike is the last resort when all reasonable efforts have failed.

Weighty matters of governance are left discarded, the soaring cost of living is beside the point and planned constitutional convulsions that aim at returning Sri Lanka to dynastic power are not important. Instead this is the new Roman circus in town, with lions and their prey circling the arena to the shocked gasps of the plebians.<\/p> <p>Alleging corruption in the judiciary<\/p> <p>Even so and as the integrity of Sri Lanka\u2019s judicial institution has come under horrified public scrutiny, the last thing that we need is increased use of contempt of court powers ostensibly wielded to \u2018protect\u2019 the adminstration of justice. There are some who have convincingly made the case that, if actor turned politician Ranjan Ramanayake, now more famous for his salacious phone conversations rather than anything else that he has done in his fairly commonplace life, wanted to establish the truth of a claim of corruption in the judiciary in regard to which he is being inquired into on contempt of court charges, he has gone a long way to establish his case as a result of this unholy fracas, regardless of the ethics of what he did. That may be one point of view. That is a matter that is already before court.<\/p> <p>However, in the wake of this continuing scandal, to use contempt as a weapon to silence reasonable dissent expressed in regard to judicial orders, including a magisterial remand order, will only be counter-productive in the public arena. This is a country where far, far worse things have happened with little deterrent effect. Monks have stormed into courtrooms to insult judges and lawyers and have thereafter been pardoned by the executive. Military men turned lawyers (or vice-versa) have publicly maligned brave judges who have stood up to political pressure in controversial matters involving state abuses. These cases include the attempt on Rivira Editor Upali Tennakoon\u2019s life (2008), the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda (2010), abduction and disappearance of 11 persons by the Navy (2008) and the abduction and torture of journalist Keith Noyahr (2008).<\/p> <p>So when the Bar Association issues a sanctimonious statement as it did this week, pleading with lawyers to be \u2018cautious\u2019 when making statements in respect of judges and the judiciary, this is a forsaking of its essential responsibility to do more than just helplessly wriggle on the end of a stick. In this statement moreover, the Bar has expressed the marvelous sentiment that a few corrupt judges should not taint the entire institution. But it does not require the Bar to say this very obvious fact. What the Bar is called upon to do is to go a step further, beyond its uselessly rattling the cage in which it functions, and take concrete steps that address the issue of judicial integrity as well as judicial independence.<\/p> <p>Mediating the relationship between citizens and judges<\/p> <p>Foremost in this regard is the enactment of a Contempt of Court Act in line with Sri Lanka\u2019s neighbouring countries which mediates the relationship of citizens with judges. A Code of Ethics for the judiciary is not likely to have any practical impact beyond affording a useful reason to have conferences and propound nonsense. However, a Contempt law has been a long felt need in this country. A decade or so ago, a draft Contempt law had already been approved by the Bar Council. Similar efforts were taken by the Law Commission of Sri Lanka, by the Editors Guild and by the Human Rights Commission.<\/p> <p>The general contents of these drafts reflected modern contempt laws embodying best practices. Where the offence of scandalizing the court is concerned, there are competing interests in issue. These are the dignity and the authority of the judiciary on the one hand and the freedom of speech and the public interest in the due administration of justice on the other. The two extremes that Sri Lanka has seen so far (namely judicial coerciveness versus judicial silence) must yield to a sober balancing of these two interests. That balance should not be left to the individual discretion of a particular judge. Instead it must be provided for by law with appropriate penalties. Protection must be specified for fair and reasonable comment on cases. The rule against commenting on pending proceedings in court must be based on the modern test of substantial prejudice.<\/p> <p>Courts in the United Kingdom have declared that there must not be gagging of bona fide public discussion of controversial matters of general public interes. Contemporaneous legal proceedings in which some particular instance of these controversial matters may be in issue are not automatically accepted as a ground to deny public discussion. Dealing with refusal to disclose sources of information and standards of professional ethics, courts are empowered to do so only when \u201cdisclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.\u201d The greater the legitimate public interest in the information, the greater would be the importance of protecting the source.<\/p> <p>Strategic measures needs to be taken to handle the scandal<\/p> <p>The freedom to debate the conduct of public affairs by the judiciary does not however mean that personal criticism of judges or scurrilous and unwarranted attacks on the judicial institution, are condoned. These are also matters that are generally dealt with through a contempt law. In Sri Lanka, this becomes important in the context of unrestrained and vicious attacks on the judicial institution particularly in unregulated social media. Where Ramanayake\u2019s leaked phone recordings are concerned, using contempt of court as a device to suppress discussion will be useless as the viral spreading of these recordings cannot be stopped by law.<\/p> <p>Therefore, strategic measures are needed to be put into place in order that the credibility of the judicial institution in Sri Lanka does not suffer any more than it already has. One vital step would also be to make the functioning of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) proactively more transparent as it takes steps to discipline and control judicial officers. Rather than reacting to a scandal as is the case now, institutional accountability that does not impact negatively on the due administration of justice may be considered.<\/p> <p>Sensible steps towards this end are needed, not flamboyant rhetoric or moralistic preaching from the Bar, which has no right to preach given its singular and long standing dereliction of duty in addressing outstanding issues of public concern in respect of the Bench and the Bar alike. Kowtowing to politicians, irrespective of whether these are green, blue or purple, is not one of those professional duties as much as this may be lucrative for lawyers to fill their deep pockets. Indeed this is one of the reasons why those trained in the practice of the law are looked upon with mistrust and suspicion by the public.<\/p> <p>Dispelling that negative perception must be a primary aim in the future.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3MZ3TAMYTN2V2DOMGJV6BRQYF4BRIT"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":739,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","unknown","torture"],"year":"2008","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Upali Tennakoon","victim_keywords":"Rivira Editor, attempted assassination","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Prageeth Ekneligoda","victim_keywords":"disappeared, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Keith Noyahr","victim_keywords":"journalist, abducted, tortured","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Navy emembers, abduction, disappearance","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","unknown","torture"],"year":"2008","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Upali Tennakoon","victim_keywords":"Rivira Editor, attempted assassination","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Prageeth Ekneligoda","victim_keywords":"disappeared, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Keith Noyahr","victim_keywords":"journalist, abducted, tortured","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Navy emembers, abduction, disappearance","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1028817656,"Input.title":"How Netherlands systematically used extreme violence in Indonesia and hushed this up afterwards","Input.publish_date":"2022-02-17 14:24:14","Input.article_interface":"<p>Dutch troops, judges and politicians collectively tolerated and hushed up the systematic use of extreme violence during the Indonesian War of Independence. Historians have now shown how this could happen. \u2018It was scandal management rather than prevention,\u2019 says Leiden historian and research leader Gert Oostindie.<\/p> <p>In their publication Over de grens (Over the Border) the 17 authors have presented their main conclusions: Dutch troops used extreme violence such as executions, torture and torching villages more often than was thought. The violence was systematic and went unchecked. The reason: the war against the Republic of Indonesia had to be won and the Netherlands wanted to be in charge of the decolonisation process, say the researchers.<\/p> <p>Gert Oostindie, Professor of Colonial and Postcolonial History, is the first author of the book. As former director of KITLV\/Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, he initiated the programme together with the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (NIOD) and the Netherlands Institute of Military History (NIMH). Various Leiden historians worked on the programme (see below) and a total of 14 books will be published. In an interview, Oostindie explains how they approached the research.<\/p> <p>Intimidation and violence against Indonesian citizens. NIMH collection.<\/p> <p>In recent years several studies have been published on this topic. What was missing?<\/p> <p>\u2018This decolonisation war was the Netherlands\u2019 biggest 20th-century war. There are libraries full of books about what the Germans did to us, but until recently we could barely fill a bookshelf on this war. This is why we called for a major study in 2012. There were hardly any studies at the time, but more have appeared recently. At the end of the 1960s, there were revelations about extreme violence. In 1969, the government took the stance that there had been excesses, but that the armed forces had behaved correctly as a whole. Thanks in part to the dissertation by R\u00e9my Limpach, who was on this research team, and also because of other studies such as my book \u2018Soldaat in Indonesi\u00eb\u2019 [Soldier in Indonesia, ed.] there were more and more signs that the Dutch armed forces were guilty of systematically using extreme violence, but by no means everything had been properly investigated. We have now reconstructed attitudes to violence in the whole chain: from the armed forces and especially the commanding officers to lawyers and politicians.\u2019<\/p> <p>\u2018Some wrote that the violence was unacceptable whereas others wrote that nothing happened or that such violence was unavoidable.\u2019<\/p> <p>How could the cover-up culture be so persistent?<\/p> <p>\u2018There was clear evidence of scandal management, as the study of the dynamics during the war shows. Reports of extreme violence by Dutch soldiers were minimised and covered up. We based our information on archive material such as from the intelligence services and security services and the minutes of the Council of Ministers. And a book is now being published about the post-war trend: people didn\u2019t want to hear it. What played an increasingly important role after the war was that at all levels people wanted to take account of the feelings of the veterans and the Indonesian community in Dutch society.\u2019<\/p> <p>What else came to light?<\/p> <p>\u2018A number of matters had never been properly investigated, such as how and why artillery and bombardments were used. This showed that the armed forces deliberately took risks and took little or no account of civilian casualties. The number of Indonesian dead is often estimated at over 100,000, compared to a few thousand Dutch war dead. This also points to extreme violence. Our research has also given a better impression of the work of the security services and how the military justice system worked. We\u2019ve gained a broader, more in-depth picture and this also adds more nuance to the story. For instance, that there was a lot of fighting in certain parts of the archipelago, but not in others.\u2019<\/p> <p>Was a lot of new source material studied?<\/p> <p>\u2018Yes, this involved on the one hand more thorough research of known Dutch government archives and on the other a lot of new archive material, such as documents from the Dutch secret service, who confiscated texts and photos, for instance, when they arrested Indonesians. These documents say more about the Indonesian side of the story. They ended up in the National Archive and some are also in the KITLV collections at the University Library in Leiden. We also show this in the online exhibition Images of the Indonesian War of Independence at the University Library.<\/p> <p>The Dutch intelligence service at work.<\/p> <p>\u2018The publicity surrounding this research has meant that new sources from private individuals have also surfaced, such as grandad\u2019s letters or diaries from the attic. These kinds of personal stories are an important addition to the official sources, which are incomplete because little was allowed to be reported. They show how diverse people\u2019s views were: some reflect frankly on the violence and write how they thought it was unacceptable. Others write that nothing happened or that such violence is unavoidable in a war.\u2019<\/p> <p>When did the political tide start to turn?<\/p> <p>\u2018An important political turning point was in 2005, sixty years after Soekarno declared Indonesian independence, when Minister of Foreign Affairs Ben Bot said in Jakarta: we were on the wrong side of history. We shouldn\u2019t have waged that war. But at the time nothing was said about how that war was waged. We wanted to research this further and the government earmarked over four million euros for this in 2017, as co-funding but not commissioning party.\u2019<\/p> <p>A few years ago the Indonesian government wasn\u2019t keen on this research taking place.<\/p> <p>\u2018The government did indeed indicate that didn\u2019t think it necessary because they wanted to look ahead. For Indonesia, it was clear: you had no right to occupy us and we kicked you out during the war. But this research is first and foremost about finding the truth about Dutch history. To face up to the fact that we as a nation have a rosy self-image that is often at odds with how the Netherlands behaved. Incidentally, there is a difference between the position of the Indonesian government and the interest in society there and among historians. They are also looking for nuance in the official story, which was rather monolithic, when there was just as much division in society there in 1945-1949.\u2019<\/p> <p>How was the collaboration with Indonesian historians?<\/p> <p>\u2018They provided new insights, in the use of terminology alone. The research programme is now called Onafhankelijkheid, Dekolonisatie, Geweld en Oorlog (Independence, Decolonisation, Violence and War). The term independence wasn\u2019t included initially. That\u2019s not surprising because in an international academic work the term \u201cdecolonisation war\u201d is customary and we used it very deliberately in response to the framing as police action. But Indonesian historians asked: why does the title begin with decolonisation? We were already decolonised on 17 August 1945 because that was when we became independent.\u2019<\/p> <p>\u2018For Indonesia, it was clear: you had no right to occupy us and we kicked you out during the war.\u2019<\/p> <p>King Willem Alexander apologised in 2020 for the Dutch actions in Indonesia. What will Prime Minister Rutte do now?<\/p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s crystal clear that the government position from 1969 is incompatible with what we know now. So I think it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019ll say something, but what that is I don\u2019t know. That really is a political matter.\u2019<\/p> <p>You recently retired. How has the discussion about the colonial past changed in recent decades?<\/p> <p>\u2018There\u2019s a much more critical view of the colonial past, also in countries like France and England. I started out researching Latin America and the Caribbean. There, but here too, there was no doubt that the colonial period was incredibly violent and racist \u2013 take the decimation of the indigenous population and the introduction of African slavery, for example. But people in the Netherlands looked at Indonesia in a different, more nostalgic way and it was harder to come to terms with this violent past. It\u2019s good that we\u2019ve reached that point and people will hopefully see the power of this research. But we\u2019re not there yet. Much more Dutch than Indonesian material has been studied and ideally Dutch and Indonesian historians will continue this together. Most insights come about when researchers look at the same sources from different perspectives.\u2019<\/p> <p>Several historians from Leiden worked on this national research programme, from the KITLV and the University, such as NIMH director Ben Schoenmaker, a professor by special appointment in Leiden.

He visited a couple of sacred places, experienced the public\u2019s ire in loud calls for his resignation, and had a powwow with his abiding supporters, solidifying plans which would have been laid days before were solidified.<\/p> <p>Next morning, busloads of Mahinda devotees and hired thugs (reportedly at 2000rupees a day, a reflection of the economic crisis and the resultant mass desperation) were brought to Temple Trees. Mahinda Rajapaksa gave them a speech. They poured out of the Temple Trees armed with poles and laid waste to Maina-go-gama, the protest encampment outside the premises. Then, with no hindrance from the police, who would have been told to stay out of it by their political masters, they made their way to Gota-go-gama and laid waste to it. Even the makeshift library did not escape the devastating onslaught.<\/p> <p>Meantime, the government declared a curfew effective immediately.<\/p> <p>From that point, events departed drastically from the Rajapaksa script. The protesters resisted and overcame the attackers. Across the country, people, ignoring the curfew, poured on to streets in solidarity.<\/p> <p>Knowingly or unknowingly, the Rajapaksas had done something more devastating than sending an army of thugs to attack the two protest encampments. They had sent a dose of their own poison along with their thugs. The unarmed protestors confronted the defeated the attackers. But not before the toxin was injected into the bloodstream of the protest movement.<\/p> <p>As day turned into night, the anti-Rajapaksa struggle moved away from being the antithesis of Rajapaksas, and became their pale copy.<\/p> <p>Means and ends: the old conundrum. The ruins of struggles and revolutions corroded from within remind us that means shape and colour ends. An unjust struggle cannot create a just society. Mobs are mobs, limbs without heads or hearts guided by a single compulsion, irrespective of what their battle-cry is, be it Kill Tamils or Aragalayata Jayaweva (Victory to the Struggle).<\/p> <p>The public stripping of Rajapaksa thugs by Gota-go-gama protestors symbolise the discarding of the core-values of resistance, decency, mercy, and non-excess. The fires engulfing hated SLPP leaders are also incinerating the promise of a better Sri Lanka.<\/p> <p>Learning from history<\/p> <p>On 22nd October 2007, a group of Black Tigers attacked the Saliyapura air force camp in Anuradhapura. Afterwards, the Lankan Forces stripped the corpses of the attackers (including of three women) and paraded them in the Anuradhapura town: Many local people, instead of cheering, responded with embarrassment and even outrage.<\/p> <p>Two years later, the dead body of Vellupillai Pirapaharan, was stripped down to his underpants, and displayed \u2013 to wild acclaim. There was no shame or embarrassment when pictures of captured Tiger cadres, including radio announcer Issipriya and Vellupillai Pirapaharan\u2019s 13 year old son (a non-combatant) were publicised, pictures taken shortly before they were murdered.<\/p> <p>In two short years, the Rajapaksas had succeeded in infecting Sinhala society with their brand of unethical ethics. Only success and victory mattered, not the road to it, or its aftermath. With this sanctification of the abhorrent, Lankan society reached a new level of brutalisation.<\/p> <p>To heal that Sri Lanka the Rajapaksa virus has to be removed from the national bloodstream. In the month since current protests began, the hope that we are on our way to such a cure began to take root. That hope is now almost dead. When Galle Face protestors stripped their attackers, took pictures of them, and paraded them, when those indecencies were lionised and those pictures celebrated, that development held up a mirror before us. The visage is showed belonged to the enemy we wanted to depose. We might all be against the Rajapaksas now; but we have not stopped being like them.<\/p> <p>If further evidence was needed, it came in the form of a series of tweets by journalist Roel Raymond, published in Newswire. Ms. Raymond was doing her job as a journalist, recording the public protest at the back gate of the Temple Trees. The protestors objected to their doings being recorded by her. \u201cWatched men stripped naked, beaten and bloodied being brought in, some carried by hands and legs. Terrible scenes. Same crowd would have turned on me had I not been taken out by friends,\u201d she wrote in her first tweet. Two minutes later, the second one, \u201cTear gas just now shot at protestors there so I am glad I got out in the nick of time. Had actually feared I too would be stripped and beaten...\u201d<\/p> <p>She ended her tweet by saying \u201cRajapaksas you did this.\u201d There is no argument that with their brutal attacks on Galle Face and Temple Trees protestors, the Rajapaksas paved the road to this calamity. But was it inevitable? Why did non-violent protestors allow Rajapaksas to push them into violence? Why did ordinary human beings let Rajapaksas turn them into rampaging mobs? Do we have no will of our own? Must we always react, and rush like driven cattle?<\/p> <p>What is the difference between this reaction, and other reactive actions such as Black July or the LTTE\u2019s Anuradhapura massacre? Must we always pile wrong on wrong, respond to violence with violence, become like the enemy we oppose?<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t we have minds of our own to make different choices and the courage to activate them?<\/p> <p>When Black July erupted, individual Sinhalese helped individual Tamils, but as a society we failed to take a stand against the crimes being committed in our name. The same thing happened vis-a-vis the LTTE and the Tamil society (with some courageous exceptions like Rajini Rajasingham Thiranagama). It was the same story during the second JVP insurgency, the Eelam War (especially the fourth one) and the various attacks on Christians and Muslims by Sinhala mobs.<\/p> <p>This unwillingness to criticise our own side, intolerance of such criticism to the point of equating it with enemy action continues.<\/p> <p>Stripping and photographing one\u2019s opponent, parading them around sans clothes is not resistance or heroism. It is brutality, cowardice, and thuggery on par with the Rajapaksas. Those who attack and burn houses and destroy vehicles are not protestors. They are mobs. We failed\/refused to see these differences in the past. If we are still unable\/unwilling to make those distinctions, if we are still reluctant to criticise our own side, how can our national future be any different from our national past?<\/p> <p>The solution to tyranny is not anarchy<\/p> <p>Ignoring the rule of law, replacing the rule of law with the law of the rulers is a Rajapaksa trait. Now we, their opponents, have taken a leaf from their book, replacing the rule of law by the law of the mobs.<\/p> <p>This way, even if the Rajapaksas go today and go willingly, their tyranny will not be succeeded by democracy but by anarchy.<\/p> <p>This embracing of violence, illegality and indecency can lead to one of three outcomes: the Rajapaksas aligning themselves with the military and imposing a reign of terror; the military capturing power and imposing a reign of terror; mob rule imposing a reign of terror. Always, and each time, a reign of terror, with no peace or stability, no justice or tolerance.<\/p> <p>There is still time to stop, turn back, take a less devastating path, realise the promise of the first phase of the struggle. Politicians of all stripes have lost credibility and relevance. But there are others who can still provide a reasoned, just, and democratic leadership to the leaderless resistance. Lawyers led by the BASL, doctors led by SLMA (and not the GMOA), a few religious figures, some trade union and civil society leaderds can still come forward to educate, explain, and guide the struggle away from the looming abyss. Similarly the leading activists of Gota-go-gama should condemn the ongoing violence and plead for a cessation.<\/p> <p>The Rajapaksas must go, not one or some of them, but all of them including President Gotabaya. Maybe the chief justice can be an interim president until the executive presidency is abolished. Maybe a group of experts, sent to parliament via national list, form a cabinet, and implement urgent economic and political measures until an election is held, perhaps in six months. These measures may not be strictly constitutional, but the alternative is the constitution either being suspended under military rule or becoming irrelevant under mob rule.<\/p> <p>In the Iliad, when god Hephaestos devised a new shield for Achilles at the request of his mother, he adorned that instrument of war with scenes of peace. Perhaps it was his, and the poet\u2019s way of reminding humanity of what it loses to violence.<\/p> <p>The memories of the first Gota-go-gama, a haven of peace, a place of promise, its images recorded for posterity, is like the Shield of Achilles, a reminder of what we could be if we, in our just anger, don\u2019t give into our worst impulses. There is still time to stop, to change track, to stop being like Rajapaksas, to abandon their ethos, to cleanse ourselves of their toxin, to be not just against the Rajapaksas but opposite them.<\/p> <p>The Rajapaksas created a moral wasteland and called it patriotism, and damned anyone not succumbing to it as traitors to the nation. In that desert, anything could be done to the enemy, anything; law, morality, ethics, decency, pity, mercy, compassion, reason were all banned in that space.<\/p> <p>The anti-Rajapaksa struggle is in the process of creating a similar moral wasteland, calling it Aragalaya (struggle) where anything goes, so long as it is done to the Rajapaksas and their supporters.<\/p> <p>How can a different Sri Lanka, a better Sri Lanka come into being in such a place?<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t try to teach Gota-go-game protestors; just learn from them was a popular saying in the resistance space. There was much to learn from Gota-go-gama protestors. But they too had \u2013 and have \u2013 much to learn from history. And one key lesson is that attempts to create utopias end in dystopias, always, every time.<\/p> <p>Violence, intolerance, indecency, these are all habit forming. And once the habit is formed, escaping is harder. Political devastation will worsen economic devastation. No aid, no trade, no investment, no production, nothing to consume, more want, more poverty, more anger, more violence, eventually turning on Tamils, on Muslims on other Sinhalese, the worst vicious cycle, endlessly repeated.<\/p> <p>We can stop that degeneration. Still. If we depart from the false turn, now.<\/p> <p>Tomorrow will be too late.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"35F6NGNVMAYBT8KI1HW4KH17PC4T7Q"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":607,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["killing"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vellupillai Pirapaharan","victim_keywords":"murdered, showcase, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protestors, Gota-go-gama, Gota-go-game, Tamil, anti-Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka, Temple Trees","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["killing"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vellupillai Pirapaharan","victim_keywords":"murdered, showcase, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protestors, Gota-go-gama, Gota-go-game, Tamil, anti-Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka, Temple Trees","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":938713610,"Input.title":"Tawanda Mutasah: How Mnangagwa became an international outlaw \u2013 Nehanda Radio","Input.publish_date":"2020-08-03 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By Tawanda Mutasah<\/p> <p>The 31 July arrest by Mnangagwa\u2019s regime of internationally acclaimed author Tsitsi Dangarembga, lawyer Fadzayi Mahere, and other peaceful, socially-distancing protesters, some of them even standing alone or walking near their homes holding mild-mannered protest placards, rounded off a febrile month of citizen discontent and state confusion.<\/p> <p>Tawanda Mutasah is an international lawyer and a recipient of the International Bar Association\u2019s International Rule of Law Award.<\/p> <p>It was a month in which Zimbabwe\u2019s callous regime showed its true colors often and vividly, including in how the case of Hopewell Chin\u2019ono and Mduduzi Mathuthu unmasked the regime\u2019s posturing to the international community about fighting corruption.<\/p> <p>Today, as Chin\u2019ono, arrested on 20 July, clocks two weeks in pretrial detention after being denied bail, while Obadiah Moyo, the Mnangagwa ally whose graft Chin\u2019ono exposed, sleeps in the comfort of his own bed, Mnangagwa finds himself unable to fend off the international opprobrium that this new low has attracted.<\/p> <p>Despite investments to burnish the government\u2019s image in international society, Mnangagwa can no longer convince any rational observer that his gross violations of the human rights of his own people are somehow an act of righteous resistance against the West \u2013 the favorite bogeyman of his regime.<\/p> <p>That corruption-busting journalists Chin\u2019ono and Mduduzi Mathuthu \u2013 the latter now being sought by Mnangagwa\u2019s security forces who thought nothing of abducting his non-journalist relatives and even brutally torturing his nephew Tawanda Muchehiwa to ransom Mathuthu into surrendering himself \u2013 are being punished through the blatant abuse of police powers, bail and pretrial detention, has ultimately confirmed to the world what Mnangagwa\u2019s regime is actually about \u2013 in spite of its rhetoric.<\/p> <p>It will be recalled that, formally during some periods, and informally during others, Mnangagwa had been Mugabe\u2019s trusted special security affairs assistant for all of forty years, from 1977 during the liberation struggle against white minority rule, up to November 2017 when the former took over following the military coup that forcibly retired his mentor and father figure.<\/p> <p>When Mnangagwa began his \u201creign\u201d \u2013 as he unabashedly calls it at his ZANU PF rallies \u2013 an international community exhausted from years of Mugabe\u2019s villainy hankered after the opportunity for rapprochement and partnership. International investors imagined the dawning of a new era of predictable rules, cleaning up of pervasive corruption, and reigning in of rent-seeking officialdom.<\/p> <p>Mnangagwa himself played along, adopting the mantra, \u201cZimbabwe is (now) open for business\u201d, and, as he took to the perennial donning of a scarf in the national colors, serving as a moving billboard of the country\u2019s supposed new standing in the community of nations.<\/p> <p>Yet it has taken a mere two years for Mnangagwa\u2019s awkward pretense to collapse totally, and irretrievably. Matching Mugabe in cruelty and entitlement, but bereft of his erstwhile mentor\u2019s eloquence and intelligence, Mnangagwa has promptly cut himself out as a buffoon, pitiably clueless in statecraft, and possessing a cartoonish sense of his own invincibility.<\/p> <p>The world has now seen what discerning Zimbabweans always knew: that Mnangagwa was in fact Mugabe\u2019s water carrier and enforcer, and that November 2017 was neither state epiphany nor ruling party self-renewal, but simply the impatience of a son awaiting the inheritance of his own turn to maim, kill and steal.<\/p> <p>Because, what open-for-business rhetoric can remain standing after the vindictive arrest of Hopewell Chin\u2019ono, who has been leading expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9 of serious corruption in government, some of it implicating Mnangagwa or his family?<\/p> <p>What \u201csecond republic\u201d and \u201cnew dispensation\u201d bombast can sound meaningful after the recent abduction of, and shocking sexual violence against, three young female opposition party organizers \u2013 who included a member of the National Assembly \u2013 and the subsequent traumatization of the same women through their arrest for supposedly faking their own abduction?<\/p> <p>What claims about reforming politically and fighting corruption can be sustained after a two-year period in which peaceful demonstrators have been gunned down in cold blood, elections have been manipulated, big political fish remain untouched in spite of clear evidence that they are looting the public purse, and crimes under international law such as abductions and systematic torture continue precisely from where Mugabe left off?<\/p> <p>Now, the regime in Harare will say that Hopewell was not arrested for being a journalist. The actual allegations against him are \u201cincitement to participate in public violence\u201d, this for having tweeted to the effect that Zimbabweans must not tolerate corruption, and that they have constitutional rights of assembly and expression.<\/p> <p>The regime knows that the substantive allegations against him are legal hot air, and so clearly the idea is to effectively punish Hopewell through pretrial travesties. As senior Mnangagwa ally Patrick Chinamasa had previously expressed his discomfort that Hopewell\u2019s anti-corruption journalism was embarrassing Mnangagwa\u2019s family, the regime\u2019s animus against Hopewell is obvious.<\/p> <p>Still, to understand why the arrest and arraignment are absurd, how they amount to the use of police powers and prosecution process as persecution of (perceived) opponents, and, as Amnesty International Regional Director Deprose Muchena has observed, how they seek to inspire fear in critics, international observers need two contexts: context on the way Mnangagwa\u2019s regime operates; and context on the alleged crime itself.<\/p> <p>A few most recent examples illustrate the dynamics.<\/p> <p>Last month, Zimbabwe\u2019s Chief Justice issued directives to judges, requiring that, before they are issued, their judgments are to be \u201cseen and approved\u201d by their superiors \u2013 a patently unconstitutional instruction to judges that are supposed to be independent.<\/p> <p>Although the Chief Justice tried to walk back the order the following day by dropping the word \u201capproved\u201d to leave the requirement that the judgments be \u201cseen\u201d \u2013 whatever that means \u2013 and although it was further claimed that he had later withdrawn the entire directive, the whole purpose was and remains clear.<\/p> <p>In the same troubled month, lawyer and academic Alex Magaisa exposed the extensive looting by senior regime figures and their friends of an agricultural mechanization scheme under Mugabe, a heist that resulted in a massive public debt burden on the back of taxpayers.<\/p> <p>Against the backdrop of the recent investigative revelations by Hopewell, Mathuthu, and other journalists, of the Covid-19 supplies scandal; concerns by legislators such as Tendai Biti at the Public Accounts Committee about billions of dollars that have been diverted from another agricultural scheme, this time under Mnangagwa, styled \u201ccommand agriculture\u201d; strikes by nurses amidst a now totally collapsed healthcare system; and a festering of desperation in a hungry populace some of whom said they wanted to see mass demonstrations against the regime, throughout July Mnangagwa operated in panic mode.<\/p> <p>On 21 July, Mnangagwa announced enhanced Covid-19 lockdown measures for an indefinite period, making no reference to any calibration of levels of government measures as previously done. Under the new measures, in addition to everyone being under curfew from 6 pm to 6 am, during the day all \u201cnon-working\u201d Zimbabweans are required to stay home except when looking for essentials, a measure that is immensely complicated by the fact that formal unemployment in the country is at over 90 percent.<\/p> <p>Even against the background of a genuinely worsening Covid-19 situation, still the draconian nature of Mnangagwa\u2019s measures raised the eyebrows of the United Nations. And the insincerity of these measures became all too clear as one recalled how, since the onset of the pandemic, Mnangagwa himself had continued to convene several non-socially-distanced ruling party events, and, just prior to his 21 July announcement, it had not been unusual to see mask-less, sardine-packed police officers sitting in the beds of huge police trucks, patrolling for lockdown compliance.<\/p> <p>Lawyers have recently been arrested on charges that have stood clearly to the legal profession in the country and to international human rights organizations as the blatant persecution that they represent.<\/p> <p>And in the regime\u2019s discombobulated response to Magaisa\u2019s agricultural mechanization expos\u00e9, even Rhodesia was invoked as supposed good practice in its having passed onto black and white taxpayers the burden of odious debts generated from racist state spending on its minority white population.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that on Monday 20 July, about eight police officers broke a glass partition to force their way into Chin\u2019ono\u2019s home, seizing him without due process, and later turning him up at a Harare police station.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that on the following Tuesday, after Chin\u2019ono had spent a night in police cells, Magistrate Judith Taruvinga signed a vague and overbroad warrant for the police to search Chin\u2019ono\u2019s house for \u201cillegal documents and other articles kept at the house\u201d.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that about 30 armed riot police later that day raided Chin\u2019ono\u2019s home to seize his camera \u2013 as if a tweet would reside in a camera \u2013 and this after having acquired a second purported warrant that specified his \u201ccameras\u201d.<\/p> <p>It is also in this context that no such raids or searches were performed against Obadiah Moyo, the former government minister whose corruption Chin\u2019ono exposed so irrefutably that a protective, reluctant Mnangagwa had to fire him when the pressure became unbearable; an Obadiah Moyo who then appeared at court unhandcuffed, while Hopewell, the whistleblower against him, was handcuffed for his punitively drawn-out appearances at bail court.<\/p> <p>And no arrests have been effected against those implicated in the diversion of funds from so-called command agriculture.<\/p> <p>So, it is a context in which Mnangagwa\u2019s regime thrives on lies, on smoke and mirrors, using the law and institutions of justice not as the testaments they should be to any people\u2019s vision of belonging, fairness and dignity, but as knobkerries and carrots at the beck and call of a temperamental emperor.<\/p> <p>Such lies used to fool some, for some time. But they have now created an environment of lawlessness and injustice \u2013 an environment that, sadly, has made responsible investors think twice about bringing capital to Zimbabwe. When a regime shoots itself in the foot as Mnangagwa\u2019s is doing, the foreign investment that comes to its country is, typically, crudely extractive: blood contracts, in effect, cynically calculated to hollow out a nation\u2019s natural resources in exchange for supporting its rulers with military tanks, guns and ammunition, other apparatuses of political and social repression, and fat personal bank accounts.<\/p> <p>Tawanda Mutasah is an international lawyer and a recipient of the International Bar Association\u2019s International Rule of Law Award.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3VCK0Q0PO7TZGKFEJMPJW3LSSFYN03"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1629,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"07","date":"20.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Zimbabwe","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tsitsi Dangarembga","victim_keywords":"Author","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hopewell Chin\u2019ono","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mduduzi Mathuthu","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tawanda Muchehiwa","victim_keywords":"Tortured, nephew","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fadzayi Mahere","victim_keywords":"Lawyer","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"07","date":"20.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Zimbabwe","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tsitsi Dangarembga","victim_keywords":"Author","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hopewell Chin\u2019ono","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mduduzi Mathuthu","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tawanda Muchehiwa","victim_keywords":"Tortured, nephew","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fadzayi Mahere","victim_keywords":"Lawyer","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":960017678,"Input.title":"Ruhollah Zam: 27 July 1978 \u2013 12 December 2020 - Index on Censorship","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-16 20:05:59","Input.article_interface":"<p>On Saturday 12 December, the founder of the Telegram news channel Amadnews, Ruhollah Zam, was hanged in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison.<\/p> <p>Zam was born in Shahr-e-Rey, just outside Tehran, in 1978.

China shut Hong Kong\u2019s last pro-democracy newspaper. Brazil\u2019s government extolled dictatorship. And Belarus hijacked a passenger plane to arrest a journalist.<\/p> <p>COVID-19 has absorbed the world\u2019s energies and isolated countries from one another, which may have accelerated the creep of authoritarianism and extremism across the globe, some researchers and activists believe.<\/p> <p>\u201cCOVID is a dictator\u2019s dream opportunity,\u201d said Theary Seng, a Cambodian-American human rights lawyer who has been indicted on charges including treason in the ostensibly democratic southeast Asian nation, where Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power for more than three decades.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch accuses Cambodia\u2019s government of using the pandemic as cover to imprison political opponents without due process. Scores have been indicted and face mass trials.<\/p> <p>When it comes to government opposition, \u201cthe fear of COVID, on its own and as a political weapon, has substantially restricted mobility for a gathering or movement to take shape,\u201d Seng said.<\/p> <p>The biggest global public health emergency in a century has handed power to government authorities and restricted life for billions of people.<\/p> <p>Luke Cooper, a London School of Economics researcher and author of the book \u201cAuthoritarian Contagion,\u201d said the vast economic, health and social resources poured into fighting the pandemic mean \u201cthe state is back as a force to manage society and to deliver public goods.\u201d<\/p> <p>Restrictions on civil liberties or political opponents have been stepped up during the pandemic on several continents.<\/p> <p>For a decade in Hungary, conservative nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has curtailed media and judicial freedom, criticized multiculturalism and attacked Muslim migrants as a threat to Europe\u2019s Christian identity.<\/p> <p>During the pandemic, Orban\u2019s government brought in an emergency powers bill allowing it to implement resolutions without parliamentary approval -- effectively a license to rule by decree. In June, it passed a law prohibiting the sharing of content portraying homosexuality or sex reassignment with anyone under 18. The government claims the purpose is to protect children from pedophiles, but it effectively outlawed discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools and the media.<\/p> <p>Poland\u2019s conservative government has chipped away at the rights of women and gay people. A ruling last year by a government-controlled court that imposed a near-total ban on abortion triggered a wave of protests that defied a ban on mass gatherings during the virus outbreak.<\/p> <p>In India, the world\u2019s biggest democracy, populist Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of trying to silence voices critical of his administration\u2019s response to a brutal pandemic wave that tore through the country in April and May. His government has arrested journalists and ordered Twitter to remove posts that criticized its handling of the outbreak after introducing sweeping regulations that give it more power to police online content.<\/p> <p>Even before the pandemic, Modi\u2019s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was accused by opponents of squashing dissent and introducing policies aimed at refashioning a multifaith democracy into a Hindu nation that discriminates against Muslims and other minorities.<\/p> <p>In Russia, the government of President Vladimir Putin has used the pandemic as its latest excuse to arrest opposition figures. Associates of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny have been subjected to house arrest and charges that the mass protests against his arrest violated regulations on mass gatherings.<\/p> <p>In neighboring Belarus, authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko extended his quarter-century iron grip on power by winning an August 2020 election that the opposition -- and many Western countries -- said was rigged. The huge protests that erupted were met with tear gas, rubber bullets and mass arrests.<\/p> <p>Then, in May, a Ryanair plane flying from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in the Belarusian capital of Minsk after the crew was told of an alleged threat. Opposition journalist Raman Pratasevic, a passenger, was taken off the plane along with his girlfriend and arrested.<\/p> <p>Western nations called the forced diversion a brazen hijacking and slapped sanctions on Belarus, but those seem unlikely to induce Lukashenko to change his ways and underscore the weakness of democracies in confronting hardline regimes. Hungary\u2019s acts have drawn sharp words from fellow European Union leaders, but the 27-nation bloc has no unified response to restrictive regimes like those in Hungary or Poland.<\/p> <p>Even before COVID-19 came along, extremism was on the march.<\/p> <p>\u201cOver the last 15 years, authoritarian politics has replicated all over the world,\u201d Cooper said.<\/p> <p>\u201cDemocracy feels very fragile. Democracy doesn\u2019t have a clear vision for what it\u2019s trying to do in the 21st century.\u201d<\/p> <p>The 2008 global financial crisis, which saw governments pump billions into teetering banks, shook confidence in the Western world order. And the years of recession and government austerity that followed boosted populism in Europe and North America.<\/p> <p>In China, authorities saw the 2008 economic crash as evidence that they, and not the world\u2019s democracies, were on the right path.<\/p> <p>Historian Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Center, said the crisis persuaded China\u2019s communist government that \u201cthe West no longer had lessons to teach them.\u201d Since then, Beijing has increasingly flexed China\u2019s economic muscle abroad while cracking down on opposition inside its borders.<\/p> <p>In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uyghurs have been confined in re-education camps in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region, where activists and former detainees accuse authorities of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control and torture. Beijing instead characterizes the camps as vocational training centers.<\/p> <p>Beijing also has tightened control on Hong Kong, stifling dissent in the former British colony. Protesters, publishers and journalists critical of Beijing have been jailed and the last remaining pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, stopped publishing in June after the arrest of its top editors and executives.<\/p> <p>When the coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, authorities responded firmly -- though far from transparently -- with draconian lockdowns that got the virus in check.<\/p> <p>Mitter said the pandemic has cemented a view -- among many ordinary Chinese, as well as the country\u2019s leaders -- \u201cthat something had gone very wrong in terms of the way in which the democratic world had dealt with the virus, and something had gone right in China.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThat is now being used very much as a lesson, not just about the pandemic, but about the virtues of China\u2019s system as opposed to the systems of liberal countries,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Last year, curfews and travel restrictions also became commonplace across Europe. People in France needed to show a signed declaration to travel more than 1 kilometer (just over a half-mile) from home. And Britons were banned by law from going on vacation abroad, while some attendees at a London vigil for a murdered woman were arrested for gathering illegally.<\/p> <p>British lawmakers have expressed concern about the scope of the Conservative government\u2019s emergency powers, many passed without debate in Parliament.<\/p> <p>\u201cSince March 2020, the government has introduced a large volume of new legislation, much of it transforming everyday life and introducing unprecedented restrictions on ordinary activities,\u201d said Ann Taylor, an opposition Labour Party politician who chairs the House of Lords Constitution Committee. \u201cYet parliamentary oversight of these significant policy decisions has been extremely limited.\u201d<\/p> <p>Politicians and intelligence agencies in the West also have warned of the threat from coronavirus conspiracy theories that dovetail with existing extremist narratives. Many countries have seen large anti-lockdown, anti-mask, anti-vaccine protests attended by a mix of the far right, the far left and assorted conspiracists.<\/p> <p>The British government has warned of \u201cextremists exploiting the crisis to sow division and undermine the social fabric of our country,\u201d with different hate groups variously blaming Muslims, Jews and 5G phone technology for the pandemic.<\/p> <p>But there are signs of fighting back. The pandemic also has boosted trust in scientists and spurred demands for more accountable political leadership.<\/p> <p>In Hungary, which has one of the world\u2019s highest per-capita coronavirus death rates, there is growing opposition both to the government\u2019s pandemic policies and to its wider authoritarian thrust, and thousands have taken to the streets in support of academic freedom and LGBT rights. With an election due in 2022, a six-party opposition coalition has united to try to unseat Orban\u2019s Fidesz party.<\/p> <p>Both extremism and resistance can be seen in Brazil where the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has expressed nostalgia for the country\u2019s two-decade military dictatorship and last year attended protests against the country\u2019s courts and Congress. He dismissed the virus as a \u201clittle flu,\u201d cast doubt on the effectiveness of vaccines and opposed social and economic restrictions.<\/p> <p>Renato Meirelles, director of Brazilian polling company Locomotive Institute, said authoritarianism had advanced through \u201ca strategy of fake news and attacks on factual truth.\u201d \u201cThe next step will be questioning the electronic vote and, as such, the result of the next election,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Bolsonaro has so far been held in check by Brazil\u2019s institutions, especially the Supreme Court, which stopped him from preventing states and cities from implementing restrictions to curb COVID-19 and has ordered an inquiry into the government\u2019s pandemic response. And protests have finally spilled out onto the streets. Twice over the past month, demonstrators marched in dozens of cities across the country.<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here to fight for the rights of those in need, for the rights of my children, for my right to live, to have vaccines for all,\u201d said Claudia Maria, a protester in Rio de Janeiro.<\/p> <p>In the United States, President Joe Biden has veered away from the populism of Donald Trump, but a Republican Party radicalized by the former president\u2019s supporters has every chance of winning power again.<\/p> <p>Cooper, of the LSE, said the authoritarian tide was unlikely to recede soon.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is a struggle between democracy and authoritarianism that\u2019s going to last decades,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>___<\/p> <p>Associated Press Writers Jim Heintz in Moscow, Justin Spike in Budapest, David Biller in Rio de Janeiro, Christopher Bodeen in Beijing, Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi and Grant Peck in Bangkok contributed.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3QI9WAYOGSQRA8TYT7MM4Y5PSHSS6L"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":322,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protestors, journalists, COVID, LGBT, Muslim, Jews, Uyghur, publishers","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protestors, journalists, COVID, LGBT, Muslim, Jews, Uyghur, publishers","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":889045191,"Input.title":"The significance of the doctors\u2019 open letter in defence of Julian Assange","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-26 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The World Socialist Web Site applauds the medical doctors who have issued an open letter calling for urgent action to protect the life of imprisoned WikiLeaks founder and journalist Julian Assange.<\/p> <p>More than 65 doctors from the UK, US, Australia, Germany, Italy and Sri Lanka have brought to the attention of a global audience the terrible dangers to Assange\u2019s life. They wrote to Britain\u2019s Conservative Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday, warning, \u201cMr. Assange could die\u201d because of years of arbitrary detention and his continued incarceration in almost permanent isolation in London\u2019s Belmarsh maximum security prison.<\/p> <p>The doctors insist that Assange be moved to a university teaching hospital, where he can be assessed and treated by an expert medical team. They stress, \u201cThe medical situation is thereby urgent. There is no time to lose.\u201d<\/p> <p>Julian Assange<\/p> <p>We urge workers, young people and all those concerned with democratic rights to heed the doctors\u2019 warning and join the fight to defend Julian Assange as well as the courageous whistle-blower Chelsea Manning, who has also been locked away for refusing to give false testimony against Assange.<\/p> <p>The doctors\u2019 initiative marks a new stage in the struggle to free Assange because it has been taken independently by a group of professional workers, animated by profound concern for his fate and for democratic rights.<\/p> <p>The doctors were acutely concerned by the findings of Nils Melzer, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, that Assange is suffering the effects of prolonged \u201cpsychological torture\u201d after nearly a decade of arbitrary detention and state persecution, which \u201cmay soon end up costing his life.\u201d They saw how this warning by the world\u2019s foremost authority on torture was simply dismissed by the UK government.<\/p> <p>Following the harrowing account of Assange\u2019s physical and mental condition given by former British diplomat and whistle-blower Craig Murray, who attended the October 21 Westminster Magistrates Court hearing at which Assange appeared, the doctors decided to act. They resolved that it was their professional duty to report \u201csuspected torture of which they become aware, wherever it may be occurring\u2026 That professional duty is absolute and must be carried out regardless of risk to reporting doctors.\u201d<\/p> <p>The brave and independent action of the doctors has inspired many others, evoking a powerful global response and forcing the world\u2019s media to report on the letter. Other doctors are now coming forward to append their own signature.<\/p> <p>The open letter has revealed the massive but latent support for Assange that can and must be mobilised in his defence. The central issue is how this must be done.<\/p> <p>On June 20, the editorial board of the World Socialist Web Site issued a statement, \u201cFor a worldwide campaign to prevent Julian Assange\u2019s rendition to the US!\u201d The statement stated: \u201cThe movement to secure Julian Assange\u2019s freedom must come from below. Moral appeals to the governments that are persecuting him are less than useless. Assange\u2019s freedom must be fought for independently of, and in opposition to, the political agents of the ruling class.\u201d<\/p> <p>This position has been fully vindicated by the open letter.<\/p> <p>The doctors\u2019 stand was taken in defiance of a vindictive gang-up against Assange involving the state machinery and governments of the United States, the UK, Australia, Sweden and Ecuador to punish him for exposing war crimes in Afghanistan and elsewhere and then silence him forever.<\/p> <p>Dr Stephen Frost, a specialist in diagnostic radiology, wrote of the open letter: \u201cIf the UK government does not heed doctors\u2019 warnings and continues with its current reckless, dangerous and cruel behaviour, people from all over the world will rightly call for those responsible to be held to account. We say that the situation is medically urgent and that it must not be allowed to continue. There is no time to lose. The torture must stop NOW.\u201d<\/p> <p>In response, the UK government has again made clear that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of the plans to stage a show trial next February before carrying out a predetermined decision to extradite Assange to the US. Patel\u2019s Home Office issued a statement to the media yesterday declaring, \u201cThe allegations Mr. Assange was subjected to torture are unfounded and wholly false. The UK is committed to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that no one is ever above it.\u201d<\/p> <p>The open letter cuts across the toxic mixture of personal and political slanders employed by the liberal media, social democratic parties, including Britain\u2019s Labour Party, trade unions, civil rights organisations, right-wing feminists and various pseudo-left groups to justify their refusal to defend Assange.<\/p> <p>The letter was issued at the height of Britain\u2019s general election campaign. It was sent to Labour\u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott. But she has refused to issue any statement whatsoever. Neither Abbott nor Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has once mentioned the world\u2019s most famous political prisoner during the course of the campaign\u2014a man incarcerated less than 12 miles from the Houses of Parliament. His name doesn\u2019t appear in Labour\u2019s manifesto, even when it pledges to protect \u201cwhistle-blowers\u201d and bring in \u201ca legal right of public interest defence for journalists.\u201d<\/p> <p>Corbyn has tried to justify his refusal to defend Assange by citing the bogus sexual allegations made by two women in a case that was dropped for the second time in 2017. In April, he declared that if the case was \u201creinstated,\u201d then Assange \u201cmust answer those questions and those demands about the accusations made against him.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Swedish investigation was dropped last week, after nine years in which no charges were ever brought.

For example, there was a marked reduction in forced labor in Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton fields, and a handful of nongovernmental organizations were allowed to register. However, many human rights groups still face significant obstacles trying to register their organizations, and Uzbekistan\u2019s political system remains largely authoritarian. Consensual same-sex relations between men continue to be criminalized, carrying a prison sentence of one to three years.<\/p> <p>Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (Articles 2 and 12)<\/p> <p>Under article 120 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, men in Uzbekistan who engage in consensual same-sex sexual conduct can be prosecuted and face three-years imprisonment.[1] Uzbek authorities have repeatedly dismissed calls to decriminalize homosexuality, and a new draft Criminal Code[2] retains the offense, with the wording unchanged, in article 154, in a section of the code related to \u201ccrimes against morality and family\u201d.<\/p> <p>Gay men face threats and extortion by both police and non-state actors. Uzbek law has no provision for hate crimes, nor can crimes be prosecuted as aggravated offenses if they are motivated by hatred based on discrimination. Uzbekistan has yet to adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that includes sexual orientation and gender identity as a protected ground. As of September 2019, the Uzbek government said there were no ongoing criminal investigations involving violence against LGBT people.<\/p> <p>Uzbek police and courts have relied on the conclusions of forced anal examinations conducted between 2017 and 2021 to prosecute men for consensual same-sex relations. In a recent case of which Human Rights Watch is aware, Internal Affairs officials ordered doctors to perform forced anal exams on two men in early 2021. A Tashkent court sentenced both men to two years under house arrest, partly based on medical reports from the exams purporting to find evidence of same-sex conduct. The men, who had lived together before the arrest, were ordered to serve their sentences in cities 500 kilometers apart and have been prohibited from using the internet. The verdict against the two men confirms that both were subjected to forced anal exams while in detention. The ruling relied in part on a medical examiner\u2019s report suggesting that \u201cbruises and superficial tears,\u201d \u201cradial turns\u201d that are \u201cslightly smooth,\u201d and a \u201cslightly weakened\u201d anal sphincter tone were likely evidence of anal sex. The court ruling seems to rely on bogus theories[3] popularized by an 1857 French medical text on how to identify a \u201chabitual pederast\u201d through anal examination.[4]<\/p> <p>Forced anal exams, conducted purportedly to find \u201cproof\u201d of homosexual conduct, often involve doctors or other medical personnel inserting their fingers, and sometimes other objects, into the anus of the accused without their consent, in an attempt to determine whether the person has engaged in receptive anal intercourse. The World Health Organization has denounced the exams as a form of violence and torture.[5]<\/p> <p>The World Medical Association[6] has called on medical professionals to stop conducting the exams, saying that it is \u201cdeeply disturbed by the complicity of medical personnel in these non-voluntary and unscientific examinations, including the preparation of medical reports that are used in trials to convict men and transgender women of consensual same-sex conduct.\u201d[7]<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Decriminalize consensual same sex conduct between men and halt any prosecutions under article 120 of the Criminal Code; ensure the personal security, privacy, and non-discrimination of the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in Uzbekistan;<\/p> <p>Immediately ban forced anal exams and their use as evidence to prosecute men for consensual same-sex relations;<\/p> <p>Investigate attacks and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including threats made by law enforcement officers to use article 120 against people, and hold those responsible to account;<\/p> <p>Adopt effective nondiscrimination policies, combat violence, harassment, and hatred against LGBT people, and facilitate the registration and operation of nongovernmental groups working on LGBT issues.<\/p> <p>Labour rights (Article 6, 7 and 8)<\/p> <p>Since the last review of Uzbekistan\u2019s record, Uzbekistan has made significant efforts to reduce forced labor in its cotton sector. Positive steps that contributed to reduction of forced labour are the criminalization in January 2020 of the repeated use of forced labour, and the elimination in March 2020 of the production quota system.<\/p> <p>Although the International Labour Organization (ILO) concluded in January 2021 that there was no systemic forced or child labor in the 2020 cotton harvest, it noted that \u201cabout four percent [of pickers] were subject to direct or perceived forms of coercion,\u201d that is, approximately 80,000 people.[8] In October 2020, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights reported that the government forced employees of public institutions and enterprises to pick cotton or pay for replacement pickers during the 2020 harvest.<\/p> <p>The ILO also noted that in the 2020 cotton harvest \u201cthere were [only] isolated cases of minors below the legal working age picking cotton.\u201d However, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights[9] found during the Fall 2021 cotton harvest \u201cmore cases of child labor than in recent years, when only sporadic cases were identified \u2026they [children] were accompanied by their parents and likely reflects increasing poverty in rural areas.\u201d Nevertheless for the cotton harvest in 2021, for the first time in more than a decade of monitoring cotton harvest, Uzbek Forum for Human Rights found no systematic forced labor organized by state officials.<\/p> <p>However, the progress in elimination forced labour varies greatly between different regions of Uzbekistan. The Uzbek Forum documented that in areas which lack voluntary pickers, officials of mahalla (neighbourhood committees) resorted to pressure on potential pickers, by threatening residents that their social benefits would be reduced or withheld. Farmers lack bargaining power when it comes to negotiating their contracts and cotton price.[10]<\/p> <p>The lack of independent trade unions and civil society organizations in Uzbekistan to protect workers\u2019 rights and monitor the government\u2019s compliance with the ban on forced labor undermines sustainability of progress made so far in the cotton sector.<\/p> <p>During the reporting period, the authorities in Uzbekistan interfered regularly in the work of civil society. For example, on February 1, 2020 in Nukus, a city in Karakalpakstan, several activists, and the founding members of Chiroq, an NGO that focuses on monitoring forced labor in the cotton sector, met with five representatives of the Cotton Campaign[11] member organizations, including two staff members of Human Rights Watch. Early in the morning, a traffic police officer stopped a human rights defender, Arslanbay Utepov, as he was driving to the meeting. The police took Utepov to the local administration, where the authorities held him until the evening, and warned him not to interact with international human rights organizations. The police officers also stopped Zaripbay Reymov, a member and co-founder of Chiroq, on his way to the meeting. The officers seized his phone and took him to a police station, holding him there until the afternoon. On that day, Chiroq\u2019s founder, Guldana Seidemetova, was urgently ordered to come to a clinic where she works \u201cbecause a commission from Tashkent was coming,\u201d but no commission arrived.<\/p> <p>In its Concluding observations on the second periodic report of Uzbekistan in 2014, the Committee called on the Uzbek authorities to repeal \u201cthe mandatory registration requirement for non-governmental organizations and revising national legislation in line with its obligations under article 8 of the Covenant and article 34 of the Constitution of Uzbekistan, which affirms the right of citizens to form their own organizations\u201d[12].<\/p> <p>Since the last review, the government has taken some important steps to ease the registration process regulated by the 2014 Cabinet of Ministers Decree on the procedure for state registration of nongovernmental nonprofit organizations.[13] These steps include significantly reducing[14] the registration fee, cutting[15] the time period for government review of registration documents from two months to one month, and opening[16] a portal that allows submission of applications by nongovernmental groups online. But vague and burdensome rules remain in place.<\/p> <p>In recent years, Uzbek authorities also claim that civil society organizations[17] \u201care becoming a full partner of the state\u201d and that \u201cmeasures are being taken to increase their role and importance\u201d.[18] Yet the Justice Ministry repeatedly denies registration to independent groups on trivial and technical grounds. Without registration, the groups are not permitted to legally work in the country. In April 2021, the Humanitarian Legal Center in Bukhara was denied registration for the ninth time. The volunteer youth group Oltin Qanot (\u201cGolden Wing\u201d) has been denied registration 21 times. In September 2021, after being denied registration for the eighth time, the founders of the rights group Human Rights House filed a lawsuit against the Justice Ministry.<\/p> <p>In October 2019, President Mirziyoyev ordered the establishment of a working group to prepare a new code for nongovernmental groups with the aim of streamlining legislation on civil society and ordered the draft to be submitted for review to the Cabinet of Ministers by February 1, 2020. In January 2020, the draft was finalized, but it failed to eliminate the existing restrictions, according to assessments by local civil society experts. Subsequent deadlines have been missed. Human Rights Watch was not aware of further steps taken to finalize the draft code and it has not been made available to the public.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Fully abolish the practice of forced labor in cotton fields, including by holding accountable local authorities that mobilize state emergency services staff and private sector employees.<\/p> <p>Liberalize registration procedures for NGOs and register independent civil society; organizations, including international human rights groups, and those who have been repeatedly denied registration;<\/p> <p>Stop intervening with the work of civil society organisations aimed at documenting violations of economic, social and cultural rights;<\/p> <p>Provide information on the new code for nongovernmental groups;<\/p> <p>Allow independent trade unions to register and operate without fear of retaliation and uphold commitments to implement ILO Conventions 87 and 98.<\/p> <p>Rehabilitation of former political prisoners (article 6 and 12)<\/p> <p>The Uzbek government has released more than 50 people imprisoned on politically motivated charges, including journalists, human rights defenders, and other activists since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took office in September 2016.[19]<\/p> <p>Released political prisoners face legal and economic barriers following their release, including restrictions on freedom of movement, inability to obtain court decisions needed to appeal unlawful sentences, surveillance, and inadequate medical care for health ailments stemming from their incarceration. Former political prisoners face great difficulties reintegrating into their families and society after years or decades in prison. Many are suffering from severe physical and psychological health problems resulting from years of torture and detention in dismal conditions, often in isolation from other prisoners or in prisons far from their families. Social support structures and services they need are largely non-existent, meaning they must depend on often ill-prepared family members for the support they need.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Ensure former political prisoners receive full legal rehabilitation to enable them to take a full part in society;<\/p> <p>Address the significant medical, mental health, and economic needs of former political prisoners as they attempt to reintegrate into society;<\/p> <p>Ensure their access to adequate and appropriate medical care to treat all health problems linked to their imprisonment.<\/p> <p>Violence against Women (article 10)<\/p> <p>Deep inequality between men and women persists in Uzbekistan. Domestic violence remains a serious problem. In 2014, the Committee called on the Uzbek authorities to criminalise domestic violence and adopt the draft law on preventing violence against women.[20] To this day, neither domestic violence nor marital rape are explicitly criminalized, and the draft Criminal Code, published in February 2021, did not include a standalone offence of domestic violence. Between January and March 2021, the Internal Affairs Ministry registered 11,070 complaints of harassment and violence against women. While the State Commission on Gender Equality reported in 2019 that it had opened 197 rehabilitation and adaptation centers for women who experience violence, a June 2020 media report found that many such centers \u201cdid not exist\u201d or \u201cdid not function\u201d as intended.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Urgently introduce criminal provisions to ensure domestic violence is a stand-alone crime and subject to public prosecution and appropriate punishments commensurate with the gravity of the abuse;<\/p> <p>Ensure that survivors of domestic abuse have immediate and straightforward access to protection, including through ensuring sufficient shelter spaces, including in rural areas.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3UAU495MIK7XERR6I83G0Z94YE7UOS"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":586,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Uzbekistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"homosexual men, LGBT, anal exams, sexual orientation, gender identity","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"forced labor, trade unions, NGOs","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil rights, political prisoners, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Uzbekistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"homosexual men, LGBT, anal exams, sexual orientation, gender identity","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"forced labor, trade unions, NGOs","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil rights, political prisoners, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":928198330,"Input.title":"Gov.

They made a conscious attempt to turn that nodal point of struggle into a microcosm of a different Sri Lanka, a place where racial and religious animosities were absent, the youth were heard and women could be both active and safe, a space of sanity, decency, compassion, and reason. A symbol of the best in us both as individuals and a nation, a microcosm of what Sri Lanka could be when her people embrace their best impulses rather than the worst.<\/p> <p>As the days passed and the struggle spread, that spirit seemed to be spilling over and permeating other loci of resistance. Even when a young father of two was brutally gunned down in Rambukkana by the police, the protestors resisted the siren song of violent retaliation. Despite innumerable provocations by the Rajapaksas, sanity and peace prevailed.<\/p> <p>Then Mahinda Rajapaksa, the political paterfamilias of this most egregious of political families, went to the ancient city of Anuradhapura. He visited a couple of sacred places, experienced the public\u2019s ire in loud calls for his resignation, and had a powwow with his abiding supporters, solidifying plans which would have been laid days before were solidified.<\/p> <p>Next morning, busloads of Mahinda devotees and hired thugs (reportedly at 2000rupees a day, a reflection of the economic crisis and the resultant mass desperation) were brought to Temple Trees. Mahinda Rajapaksa gave them a speech. They poured out of the Temple Trees armed with poles and laid waste to Maina-go-gama, the protest encampment outside the premises. Then, with no hindrance from the police, who would have been told to stay out of it by their political masters, they made their way to Gota-go-gama and laid waste to it. Even the makeshift library did not escape the devastating onslaught.<\/p> <p>Meantime, the government declared a curfew effective immediately.<\/p> <p>From that point, events departed drastically from the Rajapaksa script. The protesters resisted and overcame the attackers. Across the country, people, ignoring the curfew, poured on to streets in solidarity.<\/p> <p>Knowingly or unknowingly, the Rajapaksas had done something more devastating than sending an army of thugs to attack the two protest encampments. They had sent a dose of their own poison along with their thugs. The unarmed protestors confronted the defeated the attackers. But not before the toxin was injected into the bloodstream of the protest movement.<\/p> <p>As day turned into night, the anti-Rajapaksa struggle moved away from being the antithesis of Rajapaksas, and became their pale copy.<\/p> <p>Means and ends: the old conundrum. The ruins of struggles and revolutions corroded from within remind us that means shape and colour ends. An unjust struggle cannot create a just society. Mobs are mobs, limbs without heads or hearts guided by a single compulsion, irrespective of what their battle-cry is, be it Kill Tamils or Aragalayata Jayaweva (Victory to the Struggle).<\/p> <p>The public stripping of Rajapaksa thugs by Gota-go-gama protestors symbolise the discarding of the core-values of resistance, decency, mercy, and non-excess. The fires engulfing hated SLPP leaders are also incinerating the promise of a better Sri Lanka.<\/p> <p>Learning from history<\/p> <p>On 22nd October 2007, a group of Black Tigers attacked the Saliyapura air force camp in Anuradhapura. Afterwards, the Lankan Forces stripped the corpses of the attackers (including of three women) and paraded them in the Anuradhapura town: Many local people, instead of cheering, responded with embarrassment and even outrage.<\/p> <p>Two years later, the dead body of Vellupillai Pirapaharan, was stripped down to his underpants, and displayed \u2013 to wild acclaim. There was no shame or embarrassment when pictures of captured Tiger cadres, including radio announcer Issipriya and Vellupillai Pirapaharan\u2019s 13 year old son (a non-combatant) were publicised, pictures taken shortly before they were murdered.<\/p> <p>In two short years, the Rajapaksas had succeeded in infecting Sinhala society with their brand of unethical ethics. Only success and victory mattered, not the road to it, or its aftermath. With this sanctification of the abhorrent, Lankan society reached a new level of brutalisation.<\/p> <p>To heal that Sri Lanka the Rajapaksa virus has to be removed from the national bloodstream. In the month since current protests began, the hope that we are on our way to such a cure began to take root. That hope is now almost dead. When Galle Face protestors stripped their attackers, took pictures of them, and paraded them, when those indecencies were lionised and those pictures celebrated, that development held up a mirror before us. The visage is showed belonged to the enemy we wanted to depose. We might all be against the Rajapaksas now; but we have not stopped being like them.<\/p> <p>If further evidence was needed, it came in the form of a series of tweets by journalist Roel Raymond, published in Newswire. Ms. Raymond was doing her job as a journalist, recording the public protest at the back gate of the Temple Trees. The protestors objected to their doings being recorded by her. \u201cWatched men stripped naked, beaten and bloodied being brought in, some carried by hands and legs. Terrible scenes. Same crowd would have turned on me had I not been taken out by friends,\u201d she wrote in her first tweet. Two minutes later, the second one, \u201cTear gas just now shot at protestors there so I am glad I got out in the nick of time. Had actually feared I too would be stripped and beaten...\u201d<\/p> <p>She ended her tweet by saying \u201cRajapaksas you did this.\u201d There is no argument that with their brutal attacks on Galle Face and Temple Trees protestors, the Rajapaksas paved the road to this calamity. But was it inevitable? Why did non-violent protestors allow Rajapaksas to push them into violence? Why did ordinary human beings let Rajapaksas turn them into rampaging mobs? Do we have no will of our own? Must we always react, and rush like driven cattle?<\/p> <p>What is the difference between this reaction, and other reactive actions such as Black July or the LTTE\u2019s Anuradhapura massacre? Must we always pile wrong on wrong, respond to violence with violence, become like the enemy we oppose?<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t we have minds of our own to make different choices and the courage to activate them?<\/p> <p>When Black July erupted, individual Sinhalese helped individual Tamils, but as a society we failed to take a stand against the crimes being committed in our name. The same thing happened vis-a-vis the LTTE and the Tamil society (with some courageous exceptions like Rajini Rajasingham Thiranagama). It was the same story during the second JVP insurgency, the Eelam War (especially the fourth one) and the various attacks on Christians and Muslims by Sinhala mobs.<\/p> <p>This unwillingness to criticise our own side, intolerance of such criticism to the point of equating it with enemy action continues.<\/p> <p>Stripping and photographing one\u2019s opponent, parading them around sans clothes is not resistance or heroism. It is brutality, cowardice, and thuggery on par with the Rajapaksas. Those who attack and burn houses and destroy vehicles are not protestors. They are mobs. We failed\/refused to see these differences in the past. If we are still unable\/unwilling to make those distinctions, if we are still reluctant to criticise our own side, how can our national future be any different from our national past?<\/p> <p>The solution to tyranny is not anarchy<\/p> <p>Ignoring the rule of law, replacing the rule of law with the law of the rulers is a Rajapaksa trait. Now we, their opponents, have taken a leaf from their book, replacing the rule of law by the law of the mobs.<\/p> <p>This way, even if the Rajapaksas go today and go willingly, their tyranny will not be succeeded by democracy but by anarchy.<\/p> <p>This embracing of violence, illegality and indecency can lead to one of three outcomes: the Rajapaksas aligning themselves with the military and imposing a reign of terror; the military capturing power and imposing a reign of terror; mob rule imposing a reign of terror. Always, and each time, a reign of terror, with no peace or stability, no justice or tolerance.<\/p> <p>There is still time to stop, turn back, take a less devastating path, realise the promise of the first phase of the struggle. Politicians of all stripes have lost credibility and relevance. But there are others who can still provide a reasoned, just, and democratic leadership to the leaderless resistance. Lawyers led by the BASL, doctors led by SLMA (and not the GMOA), a few religious figures, some trade union and civil society leaderds can still come forward to educate, explain, and guide the struggle away from the looming abyss. Similarly the leading activists of Gota-go-gama should condemn the ongoing violence and plead for a cessation.<\/p> <p>The Rajapaksas must go, not one or some of them, but all of them including President Gotabaya. Maybe the chief justice can be an interim president until the executive presidency is abolished. Maybe a group of experts, sent to parliament via national list, form a cabinet, and implement urgent economic and political measures until an election is held, perhaps in six months. These measures may not be strictly constitutional, but the alternative is the constitution either being suspended under military rule or becoming irrelevant under mob rule.<\/p> <p>In the Iliad, when god Hephaestos devised a new shield for Achilles at the request of his mother, he adorned that instrument of war with scenes of peace. Perhaps it was his, and the poet\u2019s way of reminding humanity of what it loses to violence.<\/p> <p>The memories of the first Gota-go-gama, a haven of peace, a place of promise, its images recorded for posterity, is like the Shield of Achilles, a reminder of what we could be if we, in our just anger, don\u2019t give into our worst impulses. There is still time to stop, to change track, to stop being like Rajapaksas, to abandon their ethos, to cleanse ourselves of their toxin, to be not just against the Rajapaksas but opposite them.<\/p> <p>The Rajapaksas created a moral wasteland and called it patriotism, and damned anyone not succumbing to it as traitors to the nation.

But the Trump administration is seeking to extradite Assange to the United States to stand trial for charges under the Espionage Act that could cause him to spend 175 years in prison.<\/p> <p>Assange founded WikiLeaks during the Bush administration\u2019s \u201cwar on terror,\u201d which was used as a pretext to start two illegal wars and carry out a widespread program of torture and abuse of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo and the CIA black sites. On October 8, 2011, Assange told a Stop the War Coalition rally in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square, \u201cIf wars can be started by lies, peace can be started by truth.\u201d<\/p> <p>In 2010 and 2011, WikiLeaks published classified material that Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning had provided to the organization. Manning was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking the documents. As he left office, Barack Obama commuted her sentence to the seven years she had already served. That commutation provoked \u201ctremendous anger\u201d in the Trump administration and drew Trump\u2019s attention to Assange, Eric Lewis testified. Lewis, chairman of the board of Reprieve U.S. and lawyer for Guant\u00e1namo and Afghan detainees, called this \u201ca politically motivated prosecution.\u201d<\/p> <p>The files that WikiLeaks published contained 90,000 reports about the war in Afghanistan, including the Afghan War Logs, which documented a greater number of civilian casualties by coalition forces than the U.S. military had reported.<\/p> <p>In addition, WikiLeaks published nearly 400,000 field reports about the Iraq War, more than 15,000 unreported deaths of Iraqi civilians, and the systematic murder, torture and rape by the Iraqi army and authorities that were ignored by U.S. forces.<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks also published the Guant\u00e1namo Files, 779 secret reports constituting evidence of the U.S. government\u2019s abuse of approximately 800 men and boys, ages 14 to 89. That abuse violated the Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the most notorious release by WikiLeaks was the 2007 \u201cCollateral Murder\u201d video, which depicts a U.S. Army Apache helicopter target and fire on unarmed civilians in Baghdad. At least 18 civilians were killed, including two Reuters reporters and a man who came to rescue the wounded. Two children were injured. A U.S. Army tank drove over one of the bodies, cutting it in half. The video contained evidence of three separate war crimes prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and the U.S. Army Field Manual.<\/p> <p>As they are firing on the civilians, U.S. gunmen can be heard saying, \u201cLook at those dead bastards.\u201d In his written testimony, investigative journalist Nicky Hager drew a parallel between the Collateral Murder video and the television image of George Floyd screaming \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d<\/p> <p>Assange Cannot Be Extradited for a Political Offense<\/p> <p>The 2003 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty forbids extradition for a political offense. Although the treaty doesn\u2019t define \u201cpolitical offense,\u201d it generally includes espionage, treason, sedition and crimes against state power. Trump is asking the U.K. to extradite Assange for exposing war crimes. This is a classic political offense. Assange is charged under the Espionage Act and espionage constitutes a political offense as well\u2026\u2026\u2026..<\/p> <p>Assange\u2019s Prosecution Violates Freedom of Press<\/p> <p>While the Obama administration declined to file criminal charges against Assange for fear of setting a dangerous precedent, Team Trump demonstrated no such forbearance. By charging Assange under the Espionage Act, Trump is making him a poster boy for its full court press against the media, which he calls \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d Assange\u2019s prosecution would send an ominous message to all journalists: report the unvarnished truth at your peril.<\/p> <p>No media outlet or journalist has ever been prosecuted under the Espionage Act for publishing truthful information, which is protected First Amendment activity. Journalists are permitted to publish material that was illegally obtained by a third person and is a matter of public concern. The U.S. government has never prosecuted a journalist or newspaper for publishing classified information, an essential tool of journalism.<\/p> <p>Information-gathering, reporting and disclosure fit the classic definition of activity protected by the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of the press. There is no distinction between what WikiLeaks did and what The New York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and The Guardian did as well. They all published articles based on documents WikiLeaks released. This is the reason Obama administration \u2014 which prosecuted an enormous number of whistleblowers \u2014 considered, but refrained from, indicting Assange. \u2026\u2026\u2026<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks Didn\u2019t Endanger Informants and Saved Lives<\/p> <p>Although the U.S. government claims that Assange endangered informants named in the published documents, John Goetz, an investigative reporter who worked for Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel, testified that Assange took pains to ensure that the names of U.S. informants in Iraq and Afghanistan were redacted to protect their identities. \u2026\u2026..<\/p> <p>Moreover, WikiLeaks\u2019s revelations actually saved lives. After WikiLeaks published evidence of Iraqi torture centers the U.S. had established, the Iraqi government refused Obama\u2019s request to extend immunity to U.S. soldiers who commit criminal and civil offenses there. As a result, Obama had to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq.<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks also revealed evidence of wrongdoing by other countries besides the United States. The organization uncovered Russian surveillance, published expos\u00e9s of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and some say WikiLeaks\u2019s exposure of corruption in Tunisia and torture in Egypt helped catalyze the Arab Spring\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026<\/p> <p>Assange\u2019s Prosecution Will Chill Journalism<\/p> <p>Ostensibly to get around allegations that it is prosecuting Assange for conducting journalism, the Trump administration is trying to paint him as a hacker by accusing him of conspiring with Manning to break into a government computer to steal government documents, in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. But, as Patrick Eller, a digital forensic expert, testified, the attempted cracking of the password hash was not technologically possible in 2010, when the conversation between Assange and Manning occurred. Even if it were feasible, the purpose would not have been to conceal Manning\u2019s identity and it would not have given Manning any increased access to government databases.<\/p> <p>The prosecution of Assange would set a disturbing example for journalists and media outlets that publish information critical of the government. Team Trump singled out Assange to deter journalists from publishing material that criticizes U.S. policy. If Assange is extradited to the United States and convicted of the charges against him, it would chill journalists from reporting the facts for fear they could be indicted under the Espionage Act\u2026\u2026\u2026.<\/p> <p>When she set the November 16 date for the defense to submit closing arguments, Judge Vanessa Baraitser asked the defense how the U.S. presidential election would affect its case and declared that her decision on extradition would come after that election, stating, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the factors going into my decision.\u201d Kristinn Hrafnsson, editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said that the judge \u201cacknowledged what has been clear since even before the first indictment against Julian Assange was unsealed \u2014 that this is a politically motivated prosecution.\u201d<\/p> <p>Baraitser, who has granted extradition in 96 percent of the cases that have come before her, plans to issue her ruling on January 4. If she grants extradition, there will be several levels of appeals, including to the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p> <p>The stakes could not be higher. https:\/\/truthout.org\/articles\/assange-faces-extradition-for-exposing-us-war-crimes\/?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=614ce999-9844-4d61-a600-169db0c99052<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"33IXYHIZB7X2IO5F5AQEP4KYBMG2EE"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":266,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Baghdad","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Collateral Murder, civilians, Reuters reporters, killed, helicopter attack, war crimes","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Baghdad","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Collateral Murder, civilians, Reuters reporters, killed, helicopter attack, war crimes","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1037661667,"Input.title":"Live updates | Russia-Ukraine War","Input.publish_date":"2022-04-04 04:55:37","Input.article_interface":"<p>UNITED NATIONS \u2014 A top official in the global campaign against the use of land mines is urging Russia to halt the use in Ukraine of these weapons that too often kill and maim civilians.<\/p> <p>Alicia Arango Olmos, Colombia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and this year\u2019s president of the state parties to the 1997 convention banning the production and use of land mines, expressed deep concern at media reports that Russia is using land mines in its war in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>She pointed to Human Rights Watch which said on March 29 that Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal technician located banned ant-personnel mines in the eastern Kharkiv region a day earlier.<\/p> <p>The rights group said Russia is known to possess the type of mines that were discovered, but Ukraine doesn\u2019t have them.<\/p> <p>Arango Olmos told a news conference Monday that Ukraine is one of the 164 state parties to the convention, but Russia is not.<\/p> <p>FILE - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gestures during the post-Cabinet press conference in Wellington, New Zealand, Monday, March 7, 2022.

populous country out of isolation, but his appetite for change may be waning now that he has consolidated power.<\/p> <p>Advertising Read more<\/p> <p>The 64-year-old is expected to sail past four token candidates on Sunday for a second five-year term in the ex-Soviet country whose neighbourhood includes a rising China, resurgent Russia and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev's reforms -- including ending infamous forced labour in the cotton industry -- have been hailed both by long-suffering citizens and foreign observers.<\/p> <p>His hardline mentor and predecessor Islam Karimov, who died in 2016 after ruling for more than a quarter of a century, set a low bar, having gained a reputation for torturing opponents, including by boiling and freezing them.<\/p> <p>Despite changes since Karimov's death unthinkable under his tenure, Mirziyoyev's critics say some recent moves carry echoes of the country's despotic past.<\/p> <p>\"Uzbekistan's political system is still deeply authoritarian,\" Human Rights Watch said this month ahead of the vote.<\/p> <p>\"Since the start of the year, promised human rights reforms have stalled, and in particular in the months leading up to the presidential election, there has been clear backtracking in some areas\".<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev, an energetic grey-haired man, loosened the straitjacketed economy to trade, tourism and foreign investment after taking over power in the 34-million strong republic.<\/p> <p>Ties with neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan -- countries Karimov once threatened with war over hydropower projects -- have improved.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev has advocated pragmatic ties with the Taliban, while trade with Russia and China has grown, even if he has stopped short of rejoining a Moscow-led security bloc.<\/p> <p>His tenure has also seen controls loosened over Islam -- followed by more than 90 percent of the population but viewed with suspicion by Karimov, whom critics accused of tapping the \"war on terror\" to repress devout Muslims.<\/p> <p>Free speech crackdown<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev's most celebrated achievement has been his clampdown on forced labour in the cotton fields, where wages for up to two million pickers have increased year-on-year.<\/p> <p>Authorities hope Western firms will now end a long-standing boycott after the International Labour Organization heralded the end of systemic child labour and forced labour.<\/p> <p>Elsewhere there is more continuity than change, critics argue, suggesting Mirziyoyev might not be the man to totally overhaul Uzbekistan's reputation as a rights abuser.<\/p> <p>A crackdown on critical bloggers, one of whom was sentenced to six and a half years in jail earlier this year, shows there are still plenty of red lines in a country where insulting the president is a criminal offense.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev meanwhile boasted during a recent working trip to the eastern Fergana Valley region that under him, Uzbeks had learned to \"live free, without fear\".<\/p> <p>The public prominence of the eldest of his two daughters, Saida Mirziyoyeva, 36, who held a post in the state communications agency until last year, has drawn comparisons with Karimov's eldest daughter, Gulnara Karimova.<\/p> <p>Karimova, referred to as a \"robber baron\" in leaked US diplomatic cables, is currently jailed on embezzlement and criminal conspiracy charges after falling foul of her father's regime while he was still alive.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev was born in 1957 in the east of Soviet Uzbekistan.<\/p> <p>After studying agricultural engineering, he became a deputy in the legislature aged just 32 and was later entrusted with a series of governorships under Karimov.<\/p> <p>In that role, Mirziyoyev was at the heart of a system that saw civil servants, medics, teachers and even children dispatched to the fields to fulfil government cotton quotas.<\/p> <p>As prime minister from 2003, Mirziyoyev was charged with running a tightly controlled economy that confounded outsiders.<\/p> <p>His role as heir apparent quickly became clear, as he took control of Karimov's funeral arrangements and outmanoeuvred the head of Uzbekistan's notorious security service, Rustam Inoyatov, to become leader.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev finally dismissed his rival at the beginning of 2018, paving the way for an opening of Uzbekistan that included visa-free entry for scores of countries and the end of exit visas for its own citizens.<\/p> <p> 2021

President Paul Biya, 85, won a seventh seven-year term on October 7.<\/p> <p>In the South West and North West, government security forces have committed extrajudicial executions, burned property, carried out arbitrary arrests, and tortured detainees. A Human Rights Watch report documented a range of abuses by both sides in the Anglophone regions, including arson attacks on homes and schools. According to the International Crisis Group, government forces and armed separatists killed over 420 civilians in the regions since the crisis escalated in 2017.<\/p> <p>The humanitarian consequences of the Boko Haram attacks and separatist insurgency are of growing concern. As of November, the United Nations estimated that more than 244,000 civilians were displaced in the Far North and 437,500 in the Anglophone North West and South West regions. About 32,600 Cameroonians found refuge in Nigeria. Also, Cameroon has continued to forcibly return Nigerian asylum seekers, fleeing Boko Haram attacks in northeastern Nigeria.<\/p> <p>While the government maintained it did not tolerate serious crimes committed by security forces, it failed to demonstrate progress in investigating and punishing them.<\/p> <p>On October 22, Cameroon\u2019s Constitutional Council validated Paul Biya\u2019s reelection, with 71.28 percent of the votes. The council\u2019s decision was immediately contested by one of Biya\u2019s rivals, Maurice Kamto, who claimed the results had been altered. In early November, dozens of pro-Kamto protesters were arrested in Bafoussam, Western region. Biya was sworn-in for a seventh term as president on November 6.<\/p> <p>The Anglophone Crisis: Abuses on Both Sides<\/p> <p>In the Anglophone North West and South West regions, the absence of a genuine political process to address decades-old grievances against the Biya government contributed to the radicalization of the discourse and tactics of Anglophone activists. Since mid-2017, Anglophone separatists have attacked government institutions and threatened, kidnapped, and killed civilians perceived to side with the government.<\/p> <p>In 2016 and 2017, government security forces used excessive force against largely peaceful demonstrations organized by members of the country\u2019s Anglophone minority who were calling for increased autonomy for their region. During demonstrations in late 2017, government forces used live ammunition, including from helicopters, against demonstrators and bystanders, killing at least a dozen people and injuring scores. Some individuals detained in the context of the demonstrations were subjected to torture and ill-treatment.<\/p> <p>In October 2017, separatist leaders unilaterally declared independence of the North West and South West regions, and the formation of a new nation, Ambazonia. The following month, President Biya announced that Cameroon was under attack from terrorists and vowed to \u201ceradicate these criminals.\u201d The pace and scale of separatists\u2019 attacks against security forces, government workers, and state institutions increased, especially following the arrest and deportation of 47 suspected secessionist activists from Nigeria in January 2018.<\/p> <p>Violations by Government Forces<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch found that government forces responded to the growing separatist insurgency by carrying out abusive security operations against communities suspected of supporting secessionist groups. Security forces committed extrajudicial executions, used excessive force against civilians, tortured and abused suspected separatists and other detainees, and burned homes and other property in scores of villages.<\/p> <p>During attacks documented by Human Rights Watch, security forces allegedly shot and killed over a dozen civilians, including at least seven people whom witnesses said had intellectual, psychosocial or physical disabilities who did not flee because they were unable or refused to. At least four older women died, burned alive, after security forces set their homes on fire.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch also documented three cases where security forces detained people suspected of supporting the secessionist cause, and then tortured and killed them in detention. In a fourth case, Human Rights Watch analyzed evidence of torture filmed by perpetrators, who appear to be gendarmes. On September 24 and 27, a total of nine men were allegedly executed by security forces in the town of Buea, according to videos reviewed by Human Rights Watch and a report by the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa, a local nongovernmental organization (NGO).<\/p> <p>Abuses by Armed Separatists: Attacks on Students, Teachers and Schools<\/p> <p>To enforce boycotts of schools following protests by Anglophone teachers against perceived discrimination by the Francophone-dominated national government, separatist groups attacked and burned dozens of schools, threatened teachers, students and parents, kidnapped principals and violently attacked teachers and students. In March, people believed to be armed separatists attacked a high school dormitory in Widikum, North West region, and shot dead Emmanuel Galega, a student.<\/p> <p>The pressure tactics forced the majority of schools to close during the 2016-2017 academic year, and as of May 2018 an estimated 42,500 children were still out of school, according to UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Most schools did not re-open in 2018.<\/p> <p>On April 30, Father William Neba, principal of St. Bede\u2019s College, in Ashing near Belo, North West region, was reported abducted while celebrating mass with students. He was released two days later. The school suspended classes on the day of the abduction. In September, unidentified gunmen attacked a girl\u2019s school in Bafut, North West region, kidnapping five pupils and severely wounding the principal.<\/p> <p>In September, the government endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, an international political agreement to protect education during armed conflict.<\/p> <p>On November 5, up to 78 schoolchildren were reportedly kidnapped in Bamenda, North West region, by unknown gunmen. They were released two days later.<\/p> <p>Refugee Rights<\/p> <p>Cameroon hosts more than 350,000 refugees and asylum seekers, including 260,000 from the Central African Republic and at least 90,000 from Nigeria. Despite its long history of hosting refugees, Cameroon has forcibly returned tens of thousands of Nigerian asylum seekers since 2015. A 2017 Human Rights Watch report documented how soldiers used violence and abuse, including torture, against asylum seekers in remote border regions. Authorities also imposed unlawful restrictions on movement in Cameroon\u2019s only official camp for Nigerian refugees. In August 2018, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported that between January and July, Cameroon unlawfully returned at least 800 refugees and asylum seekers to Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity<\/p> <p>Cameroon\u2019s penal code punishes \u201csexual relations between persons of the same sex\u201d with up to five years in prison. Police and gendarmes continued to carry out arrests and harassment of people they believe to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). In April, police arrested four activists and a security guard at the office of AJO, an organization that works on HIV education with men who have sex with men (MSM), and other vulnerable groups. They spent a week in jail on spurious homosexuality charges before a lawyer secured their release. Cameroonian human rights organizations documented the arrest of at least 25 other men and at least two women on homosexuality charges in the first half of 2018. They also reported numerous cases of physical violence by private citizens targeting LGBT people.<\/p> <p>Justice and Accountability<\/p> <p>While the government has repeatedly promised to investigate crimes committed by security forces, it has not done so transparently or systematically.<\/p> <p>Government officials told Human Rights Watch in June that while they conducted investigations, they did not want to make them public to avoid undermining the morale of government troops. However, the visible lack of accountability appears to have fueled abuses, like arson and torture, rather than ending them.<\/p> <p>In July, the government finally granted access to ten Anglophone leaders who had been detained and deported from Nigeria to Cameroon in January. The individuals, held incommunicado for over six months, were permitted to meet their lawyers and the International Committee of the Red Cross.<\/p> <p>The government dismissed video footage that emerged in July showing two women and two children being executed by men in uniform in Cameroon\u2019s Far North as \u201cfake news.\u201d Only after an investigation conducted by Amnesty International demonstrated the killings took place in Cameroon did the government announce it had arrested six soldiers suspected of executing the civilians in the video.<\/p> <p>Key International Actors<\/p> <p>France, the United States, and the United Kingdom are Cameroon\u2019s principal partners, primarily in the context of the counter Boko Haram operations in the country\u2019s Far North region. Both France and the US provide Cameroon with military and security assistance and training.<\/p> <p>The US and the UK are the only close allies of Cameroon to have voiced public concern regarding the ongoing situation in the Anglophone regions. The US has continued to provide military aid to Cameroon.<\/p> <p>In February, the European Union called for proportionate use of force and accountability for abuses in the Anglophone region.<\/p> <p>In September 2018, as the pace and scope of abuses continued to escalate in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone regions, the UN and African Union issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 calling on the government to facilitate access to humanitarian and human rights organizations and engage in an inclusive dialogue to address the root causes of the crisis.<\/p> <p>The UN Security Council in August expressed concern about the situation in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone regions.<\/p> <p>Share this: Tumblr<\/p> <p>Email<\/p> <p>Print<\/p> <p>Pinterest<\/p> <p>Reddit<\/p> <p>LinkedIn<\/p> <p>Facebook<\/p> <p>Twitter<\/p> <p>WhatsApp<\/p> <p>Like this: Like Loading...<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3YGYP13643ONGEZDDZ8YGZMF135RN9"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":804,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2017","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cameroon","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Emmanuel Galega","victim_keywords":"student, civilian, shot, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"William Neba","victim_keywords":"religious leader, principal of St. Bede\u2019s College, abducted, released","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"schoolchildren, Anglophones, civilians, citizens, teachers, demonstrators","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2017","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cameroon","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Emmanuel Galega","victim_keywords":"student, civilian, shot, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"William Neba","victim_keywords":"religious leader, principal of St. Bede\u2019s College, abducted, released","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"schoolchildren, Anglophones, civilians, citizens, teachers, demonstrators","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":969318791,"Input.title":"Election officials detained in Myanmar 'in bid to prove fraud'","Input.publish_date":"2021-02-12 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Myanmar\u2019s military government is detaining election commission officials in night-time raids and asking them to provide evidence that November\u2019s election was rigged, according to a senior member of the organisation.<\/p> <p>The Tatmadaw justified its 1 February coup by alleging widespread irregularities in the vote, won decisively by Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party, but their claims have been rejected by the Union Election Commission (UEC), the organisation responsible for administering elections in Myanmar.<\/p> <p>The campaign of arrests and intimidation of UEC officials has raised concerns the military is seeking to pressure the commission to give their backing to its election fraud claims.<\/p> <p>International monitors have said the general election, won by the National League for Democracy in a landslide, was fair.<\/p> <p>A senior member of the UEC, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several high-ranking personnel from the organisation in Yangon, Mandalay, Sagaing and Bago townships had been detained over the past two days, following an earlier run of military detention of UEC officials last week.

It raises considerable risks of infringement of several fundamental rights and undermines the rights to privacy and freedom of information. Disarmed in the face of the new digital disorder, the government seems incapable of effectively regulating the violence of social networks, preferring instead to reinforce a repressive legislative arsenal.<\/p> <p>The \u201cglobal security\u201d bill was passed by the National Assembly on November 20, as part of an accelerated procedure justified by the state of emergency currently in force in France. This exceptional procedure did not allow for the necessary debate on a text that poses apparent risks to several fundamental rights, particularly the right to information. Before being adopted, it will have to be presented to the Senate before being validated by the Constitutional Council.<\/p> <p>Article 24 of the \u201cglobal security\u201d bill is one of the most contested. Amended by the Assembly during the national vote on November 20, it still does not respond to the substantive concerns raised by this law. The article provides for a one-year prison sentence and a 45,000 euro fine for the dissemination of the \u201cimage of the face or any other element of identification\u201d of a police officer during an intervention when the aim is to \u201charm his or her physical or psychological integrity\u201d. On Friday, November 20, the MPs adopted a last-minute government amendment mentioning that the article will apply \u201cwithout prejudice to the right to inform\u201d and characterizing more precisely \u2013 through the word \u201cmanifest\u201d \u2013 the intention to harm the forces of law and order.<\/p> <p>An insidious weakening of the foundations of the Freedom of the Press Act<\/p> <p>While it represents a step forward, the new version of the text remains imprecise and subject to multiple interpretations. The text still does not provide the necessary guarantees. Reassuring, the champions of the text believe that \u201cit is not the images taken by journalists that pose a problem; they are not concerned since the law targets \u201cmalicious\u201d publications\u201d. The question of the interpretation that could be made of this provision poses serious risks that it is impossible to control in the current state of the text. In this context, the Human Rights Defender Claire H\u00e9don called on Friday for the pure and simple withdrawal of the controversial article of law. The ban on filming law enforcement officers for malicious purposes is indeed unnecessary and potentially harmful to the control of the action of law enforcement officers.<\/p> <p>French professionals and several NGOs defending rights have strongly mobilised to denounce the excesses of the security text. Several journalists were arrested at the beginning of the last week at the end of a rally in Paris organised by trade unions, journalists\u2019 organisations and human rights groups. The UN Human Rights Council itself ruled that the proposal, as it stands, is a serious violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to privacy, the right to freedom of expression and opinion, in contradiction with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p> <p>In the days before the vote, the National Human Rights Commission (CNCDH) had also expressed its strong disapproval of the bill. The CNCDH, an institution for the protection and promotion of human rights, which is responsible for advising the government and parliament on this issue, stated that \u201cthrough various measures, this text aims to give guarantees to the forces of law and order, in particular the ban on broadcasting images of police officers. It transfers sovereign powers to municipal police officers and private security agents, in direct conflict with Article 12 of the French Declaration of Human Rights and Citizen. \u201cThe CNCDH was unable to share this analysis before the parliamentary debate, as it is formally a bill proposed by deputies and not a government bill. This, added to the triggering of the accelerated procedure, is emblematic of the deterioration of the democratic debate, denounces the CNCDH.<\/p> <p>The French Human Rights Defender recalled the public nature of the action of the security forces and considers that informing the public and publishing images relating to police interventions are legitimate and necessary for democratic functioning, as well as for the exercise of her own missions to control the behaviour of the security forces. The Declaration of Human Rights rightly affirms that all civil servants must be \u201caccountable for their administration\u201d.<\/p> <p>In addition to this highly controversial bill, a new national law and order scheme presented on September 16, 2020, by the Interior Minister requires journalists to hold a press card and to be accredited by the authorities to cover a demonstration. This provision led to several arrests during the first demonstration on November 17 against the proposed law on global security, including that of a journalist from France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions who was held in police custody for around 12 hours.<\/p> <p>A lose-lose text<\/p> <p>The government-backed text is counterproductive from a rights\u2019 protection perspective and adds to an increasingly illegible and contradictory legislative arsenal. It is very worrying that with one law after another, what we have taken decades to build can be undone overnight, in the long run. This signals a central turning point in French politics. In 2008, a circular from the Ministry of the Interior recalled that \u201cfreedom of information, whether it is provided by the press or by private individuals, takes precedence over the right to respect for one\u2019s image or private life, provided that this freedom is not compromised by an attack on personal dignity or the secrecy of investigations or enquiries\u201d.<\/p> <p>Rather than legislating excessively and urgently, at the risk of lastingly weakening the rules of democracy and its fundamental rights, it would be preferable to consider the means made available to public services to restore trust and an open debate in the digital age. By undermining press freedom, this new law, if passed as it stands, can only increase mistrust of the news media and damage public debate.<\/p> <p>It is not by increasing opacity that the French authorities will respond effectively to the real challenge of violence in the digital space. It merely adds discredit to institutions that are already in bad shape and strikes a blow at the responsibility of the news media to ensure their transparency. It is a lose-lose text.<\/p> <p>Version fran\u00e7aise<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3LG268AV3ALJM8M0K05FQCS6NBUERX"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1412,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"November","date":"23.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"France","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, reporters","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"November","date":"23.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"France","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, reporters","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":904302123,"Input.title":"Death scene at John Vorster Square was neglectfully pro...","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Neil Aggett was a white South African doctor and trade union organiser who died while in detention after being arrested by the South African Security Police in 1982. (Photo: Chris Collingridge)<\/p> <p>Neil Aggett was alive at the moment he was strung up against the bars in the John Vorster Square (now Johannesburg Central Police Station) prison cell where he was found hanged.<\/p> <p>He may not have been conscious, but he was certainly \u201cvital\u201d. This is the conclusion of pathologist Dr Steve Naidoo who presented his testimony yesterday, Thursday 6 February, at the reopened inquest into the death of the trade unionist and doctor who was found dead in detention in 1982.<\/p> <p>Naidoo said Aggett\u2019s body showed injuries consistent with \u201cvital reactions\u201d \u2013 the live body\u2019s reaction to the impact of being hanged. There were two distinct haemorrhages that Naidoo pointed out could not have occurred after death.<\/p> <p>Naidoo also said that death occurred in one of two possible ways. The first \u201cmechanism of death\u201d would have involved the closing and compression around the carotid arteries that are on each side of the neck that would have caused unconsciousness in seconds and then death within a minute or two.<\/p> <p>The other possibility he outlined would have been as a result of the neck being constricted and the sudden gravitational traction from being hanged that would have caused a rapid drop of blood pressure, and in turn a slowing of the heart and then death minutes later.<\/p> <p>He said in his affidavit: \u201cThe only reasonable conclusion in this case is that the death was caused by the state of suspensory hanging of the body by constrictive ligature around the neck.\u201d<\/p> <p>Naidoo, who was the independent pathologist commissioned by the pro bono attorneys working on behalf of the Aggett family, spent most of his time on the stand showing up the \u201ctroubling shortcomings\u201d and inconsistencies, the lack of supervisory oversight and outright professional neglect in how the death scene was processed and how the post mortem processes were carried out.<\/p> <p>Key among the failings that Naidoo pointed out were the absence of photographs of the body at the death scene. There were also no autopsy photographs taken under correct lighting and guidance of a pathologist with labels, measurements and scales. There are only two grainy black and white photos of Aggett\u2019s body when it was hanging from the prison cell bars.<\/p> <p>In political cases, the State\u2019s chief pathologist was also responsible for overseeing an autopsy, not a district surgeon as was the case with Aggett.<\/p> <p>\u201cA death of a political detainee from hanging would always have come with a query and a challenge. A chief pathologist present at the death scene and conducting the autopsy would have been able to narrow the window of possibility from the precise nature of the ligature (a kikoi is the item that appears around Aggett\u2019s neck at the death scene), how this ligature lay, how it was tied and importantly the possibility of someone securing the ligature to themselves,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Naidoo said the autopsy was rushed and was completed just seven hours after the recorded discovery of the body at 1.30am on 5 February 1982.<\/p> <p>He added: \u201cThe family was not given the time and pre-counselling in order to digest and prepare and to bring in a private pathologist from the beginning. So the family\u2019s rights were disregarded.\u201d<\/p> <p>Naidoo also said the post mortem didn\u2019t include processes to reveal subcutaneous bruising that doesn\u2019t appear on the skin, even though the technique was already in use at the time.<\/p> <p>Naidoo continues his testimony on Friday. The precise and graphic details of what happened to Aggett\u2019s body in the moments leading to his death are what Aggett\u2019s family and friends have had to hear in the South Gauteng High Court.<\/p> <p>These details have given the likes of Liz Floyd answers. Floyd was Aggett\u2019s partner. She\u2019s also a medical doctor and recently retired from her position at the Gauteng Department of Health.<\/p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to look at the photos, not till this time last year, and the more I looked the more I could see that there was something wrong. I also volunteered to translate the jargon in the medical reports for the legal team and when I started comparing what the doctors had written in their reports and what I remembered I saw the contradictions,\u201d Floyd said outside the court on Thursday.<\/p> <p>Floyd had till then accepted that Aggett had been driven to suicide. She herself was severely tortured and suffered post-traumatic stress after Aggett\u2019s death and her own detention.<\/p> <p>Floyd\u2019s medical background, as well as her personal connection to Aggett, makes for a unique lens through which she can communicate about the medical and forensic findings.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also that it\u2019s 38 years later,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe are going through an inquest this time where there isn\u2019t extreme intimidation, hostility and threat to our personal safety. We also have the support of our loved ones and the support of other detainees \u2013 it\u2019s like a family reunion and we\u2019re catching up on all the gossip,\u201d she says with a giggle.<\/p> <p>It makes hearing graphic details about Aggett\u2019s dying just that tiny bit more bearable.

But after the pilot announced the plane had been diverted to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, one passenger \u2014 Roman Protasevich, a prominent Belarusian opposition journalist who had been living in exile since 2019 \u2014 grew terrified, certain that he faced arrest.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe panicked because we were about to land in Minsk,\u201d Marius Rutkauskas, who was sitting one row ahead of Protasevich, told the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT upon arrival in Vilnius.<\/p> <p>Sunday\u2019s ordeal \u2014 described by many European officials as an extraordinary, state-sponsored hijacking by Belarus to seize Protasevich \u2014 quickly led to one of the most severe East-West flare-ups in recent years.<\/p> <p>Meeting Monday evening in Brussels, European Union leaders called on all EU-based airlines to stop flying over Belarus and began the process of banning Belarusian airlines from flying over the bloc\u2019s airspace or landing in its airports \u2014 effectively severing the country\u2019s direct air connections to Western Europe.<\/p> <p>The measures represented a harsh Western broadside against Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus\u2019 authoritarian president, who is already under EU sanctions for rights violations over his brutal repression of protests last year. There was no indication, however, that the intensified squeeze would alter Lukashenko\u2019s resolve \u2014 especially with President Vladimir Putin of Russia steadfast in his support.<\/p> <p>On the contrary, Lukashenko on Monday tightened restrictions on dissent even further, signing new laws that banned things like online livestreams from unauthorised protests.<\/p> <p>\u201cLukashenko does not see it necessary to bow to the West\u2019s demands \u2014 he has Russia, which he relies on,\u201d said Artyom Shraibman, a Minsk-based nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cHe has not been cornered.\u201d<\/p> <p>The moves came as new details trickled out suggesting that the landing of the Ryanair Boeing 737-800 in Minsk on Sunday was an elaborately staged operation, with a bomb hoax and a fighter jet scrambled by Lukashenko to escort the airliner. The Lithuanian police said that of the 126 passengers who took off from Athens, five stayed behind in Minsk \u2014 Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who were both detained, plus three unidentified individuals.<\/p> <p>One Lithuanian official said the three included two Belarusian citizens and one Greek. But uncertainty about their identities raised questions over whether they had any role in the operation.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well,\u201d Michael O\u2019Leary, the CEO of Ireland-based Ryanair, told Irish radio Monday. \u201cThis was a case of state-sponsored hijacking.\u201d<\/p> <p>Belarusian state television broadcast a report rejecting the idea there were KGB agents on the plane, instead showing three people who said on camera that they had decided to stay in Minsk by their own choosing. They included a Greek man who said he had been traveling to Vilnius on his way to visit his wife in Minsk.<\/p> <p>In Lithuania, the police launched an investigation on suspicion of hijacking and kidnapping, and interviewed passengers and crew. They were told that the fighter jet dispatched by Lukashenko to escort the flight had not forced the Ryanair plane to land, according to people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorised to speak publicly.<\/p> <p>Instead, these people said, the pilot had decided to land the plane in Minsk after Belarusian air traffic control had requested that he do so because of a bomb threat on board.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe decision was made by the captain of the liner after consulting with Ryanair management,\u201d Rolandas Kiskis, head of the Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau, told reporters in Vilnius.<\/p> <p>But no bomb was discovered, contributing to accusations that it was all a ruse to get the plane to land.<\/p> <p>The arrested journalist, Protasevich, who co-founded an account on the social media app Telegram that helped galvanise and coordinate the mass protests against Lukashenko last year, had been placed on a list of terrorists by the KGB, Belarus\u2019 intelligence service, still known by its Soviet-era initials.<\/p> <p>A pro-Lukashenko Telegram account posted a 29-second video of Protasevich late Monday evening. It showed him sitting with arms folded at a wooden desk, telling the camera that he is in Minsk\u2019s central Detention Center No. 1 and is being treated \u201cwith maximum correctness.\u201d It was reminiscent of other confessional videos that critics of Lukashenko have been forced to record while in jail.<\/p> <p>\u201cI continue to cooperate with the investigation and am giving confessional testimony on charges of organising mass unrest in the city of Minsk,\u201d Protasevich said.<\/p> <p>The video was the latest sign that Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, did not intend to shirk from confrontation with the West. An official in the Belarus Transportation Ministry, Artyom Sikorsky, on Monday doubled down on Minsk\u2019s official version of events: that the plane had been diverted because of a bomb threat. He read out an email that he said had been sent to the Minsk airport from someone who claimed to be representing Hamas \u2014 the Palestinian militant group \u2014 threatening to punish the European Union for supporting Israel in the recent war. (Hamas denied any connection to the incident, Reuters reported.)<\/p> <p>By the end of the day, Lukashenko had plunged headfirst into yet another diplomatic showdown. He expelled the ambassador and the entire diplomatic staff of neighbouring Latvia from Minsk in response to the mayor of Riga, Latvia, hoisting the white-red-white flag of the Belarusian opposition.<\/p> <p>A prime reason for Lukashenko\u2019s apparent confidence was seen in Moscow, where Russian officials and pro-Kremlin commentators lined up to voice their support.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe consider this issue to be a domestic affair of Belarus,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokesperson, said, according to Interfax. \u201cThe actions of the Belarusian aviation authorities were in line with international standards.\u201d<\/p> <p>The International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, has said the Belarus action may have violated a long-standing treaty that has governed commercial airlines for decades. The organisation called an urgent meeting for Thursday to discuss it.<\/p> <p>In recent years, Lukashenko had profited by playing the interests of Russia and the West off against one another. But amid last summer\u2019s popular uprising against him over his disputed reelection, Lukashenko threw in his lot with Putin \u2014 and has relied on his support ever since.<\/p> <p>Last year, the European Union sanctioned Belarus officials \u2014 including Lukashenko \u2014 over human rights abuses, to little apparent effect. The flight bans could have a greater impact, at least on regular people; the summer 2021 timetable of Belavia, Belarus\u2019 national carrier, includes flights to 20 EU cities.<\/p> <p>And some analysts said the restrictions could require costly rerouting for European airlines, which are already avoiding parts of Ukraine, Belarus\u2019 southern neighbour, because of conflict with Russia.<\/p> <p>The flight bans could cause new problems for Lukashenko inside his country, where the ease of travel to the neighbouring European Union had long softened the strictures of living inside an authoritarian state. Ukraine, which is not a member of the EU, also said it would ban flights to and from Belarus. The growing isolation means that Belarusians will increasingly need to travel east to Russia in order to get out of the country.<\/p> <p>Yevgeny Lipkovich, a popular Minsk-based blogger and commentator critical of Lukashenko, said that his own travels abroad had allowed him to \u201cremain an optimist, despite the regime\u2019s best efforts to force me into depression.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cIf they close down the air loophole, there\u2019s no question that the pressure inside the country will increase,\u201d Lipkovich said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s disgusting to live in a pariah state.\u201d<\/p> <p> 2021 The New York Times Company<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3T2HW4QDUXMYLA60USZY93S9WFF9CK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":587,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"05","date":"23.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roman Protasevich","victim_keywords":"blogger, anti-Lushenko, activist, Belarus, Ryanair, diverted flight","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"05","date":"23.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roman Protasevich","victim_keywords":"blogger, anti-Lushenko, activist, Belarus, Ryanair, diverted flight","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":986988185,"Input.title":"EU Announces Sanctions on Belarus after \u2018Ryanair Hijacking\u2019, Kidnapping of Journalist","Input.publish_date":"2021-05-26 12:15:18","Input.article_interface":"<p>The European Union has announced sanctions on Belarus after the Belarusian government used a fake bomb threat to \u201chijack\u201d a plane and arrest a journalist, Roman Protasevich, earlier this week.

This article aims to assess the condition of Minorities in the country and the unjust use of blasphemy laws as a tool of oppression.<\/p> <p>Forced Conversions: A chronic problem<\/p> <p>On October this year, Arzoo Raja, a 13-year-old Christian girl, was abducted right outside her house in Karachi. She was forcibly converted to Islam and married off to her abductor, a 44- year-old man. The police denied these claims and asserted that it had sufficient proof to prove that the girl converted and married off on her own volition. To make matters worse, the Sindh high court validated the marriage (even though the legal age is 18), and stated (based upon falsified documents) that Arzoo was old enough to make her own decisions. This case isn\u2019t a one off and there have been multiple instances in the past where underage girls from minority religions have been abducted and forcefully married off after conversion. A few months ago, a Hindu teenage girl, Simran Kumari was abducted from Ghotki in Sindh and converted to Islam. She was also married off to her abductor and her parents were stopped from visiting because of them being \u2018Kafirs\u2019 . Mirpur Khas, Sanghar, and Ghotki are some of the districts that have had the highest number of such incidents and all of them come under the province of Sindh. These incidents are more than just ordinary cases of forced conversion, they are a reflection of deeper issues rooted in economic, social and cultural status of the minority communities.<\/p> <p>Most of the minority communities have been traditionally engaged in jobs associated with low income such as daily wage labour and any scope of upward economic mobility is limited. Amar Guriro, a senior journalist states that many Hindu and Christian women convert due to their poor financial condition, and that Muslim men easily lure these women on the pretext of providing better financial and living conditions . But investigations in the past have revealed that economic hardship might be a factor in these incidents but it isn\u2019t the only factor, and in most cases, the women yield to their abductors due to fear of their lives. There have been cases where after a woman is abducted from a village, large groups of Muslim men drive around the village with loudspeakers in their cars shouting \u201cthe victory of Islam\u201d. The main reason behind this is to instil a psychological fear and ensure that the minority communities do not take legal recourse. It\u2019s unfortunate that even if the victim\u2019s family were to lodge a First Information Report, it would make no difference. The police, political representatives and the judiciary are usually in cahoots, and any form of protest would be at the cost of endangering their own lives. This is clearly seen in majority of the cases where the victim is usually below 18 years of age, even though as per a recent amendment to the penal code, the legal age of marriage for girls is 18 years. The police play a huge part in providing forged documents as proof to the judges who readily accept it without questioning the legitimacy and let the accused go scot free.<\/p> <p>Blasphemy Laws<\/p> <p>The blasphemy laws in Pakistan pose another set of problems for the minorities, and are one of the strictest in the Islamic world. They were inherited from the former colonial rulers back when Pakistan was a part of India and a British colony. During the reign of the military government headed by General Zia-ul-Haq, few other clauses were added to these laws which criminalised certain acts such as insulting Islam\u2019s Prophet, speaking against the holy Quran or using derogatory language against important religious scholars. According to the data given by National Commission for Justice and Peace, there were a total of 1540 blasphemy cases which came up till 2018 and out of those 1540 cases about 50% cases had a non Muslim as the accused even when they constituted very small share of the total population . The Ahmadiyya\u2019s, a Muslim minority, are the worst affected by these laws. The Ahmadiyya community is a sect of Islam which has its roots in India and was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Unfortunately, the Ahmadiyya community faces a lot discrimination world over and is generally regarded as non-Muslim in most of the Islamic countries. According to the second amendment in Pakistan\u2019s constitution, the Ahmadis are considered as non-Muslims in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Ahmadis have had repeated allegations of blasphemy against them due to the fact that their religious beliefs contradict the verses in the Quran and are therefore equal to speaking against it. This is completely ironical to the fact that Pakistan\u2019s constitution clearly states that each and every single religious community has the right to profess, propagate and practise their religion. For the other minority religions, the blasphemy laws act as a means of seeking revenge or showing dominance for the majority Sunni Muslims. In May 2019, Ramesh Kumar Malhi, a Hindu veterinary doctor, was accused of wrapping medicines in the pages containing verses of Quran because of which his clinic and a few other shops belonging to the Hindu community were burned down . Similarly, in 2018, a 25-year-old Christian man was accused of sending blasphemous texts because of which Muslim mobs raided the houses of Christians living in the area and threatened to set their houses on fire. In both the incidents, the police filed no cases against the offending mobs. In most of the cases, it is important to note that the reason for charging someone with blasphemy is usually due some other personal conflict entirely unrelated to the charge of blasphemy and is usually used as a means to extract revenge.<\/p> <p>These blasphemy laws represent the sorry state of freedom of speech in the country. The idea that anything with regards to religion is sacred and cannot be contested leads to the formation of dogmatic opinions. While it is understandable that the blasphemy laws only apply to statements meant to defame a religion, but since these laws come under the purview of the Federal Shariat Court to determine what is Islamic or un-Islamic, even well-intentioned constructive criticism is considered blasphemous. John Stuart Mill, one of the most influential thinkers of classical liberalism, in his book \u2018On Liberty\u2019 talks about the role of freedom of speech and expression. He says \u201cIf all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\u201d. The reasoning behind this is to show how important it is to allow divergent views to be spoken about clearly, and even if there is disagreement about the truthfulness of a particular view or opinion, there\u2019s always a possibility that it might contain a certain element of truth. The inability of a country to tolerate divergent views is representative of its insecurity towards criticism and change. This eventually leads to its downfall as even the most common and rational arguments are sometimes suppressed.<\/p> <p>Subpar Standard of Living<\/p> <p>While the cases above represent some of the worst atrocities against minorities in Pakistan, their everyday lives don\u2019t provide a very bright picture either. There has been discrimination in the past with regards to employment, such that sanitation work or daily wage labour work was restricted to non-Muslims only. Even with regards to education, there have been reports where the students from the minority religions have faced religious slurs or have been plainly discriminated by the teachers. Some of the textbooks portray the minorities in a negative light and completely negate their existence when recounting the history of the country, this reinforces an anti-minority mindset within the young adults and prevents the minorities from enrolling in educational institutions which restricts their social and economic upward mobility. In general, at least in the rural areas, non-Muslims have faced violence and many have lost their lives too. There have been numerous cases where houses of Hindus and Christians have been burnt down, their men, women and children killed or forced to leave the village. Temples and Churches have been destroyed in many areas, such that only a handful remain. A survey by the Pakistan All Hindu Rights Movement showed that out of a total of 428 temples that were present in the country during independence only 20 remain today.<\/p> <p>While the government of Pakistan refuses to do anything, human rights lawyers and non governmental organisations present a ray of hope. In the past, journalists, activists and human rights lawyers have actively taken up cases of forced conversion, religious violence and misgovernance. This has made justice an achievable reality, even if it is only for a handful of cases. But the downside to this is that by saving the lives of others, the activists and lawyers have put their own lives at risk. There have been many instances where activists and journalists have received threats and backlash from religious extremists, some have even lost their lives. On 5thJune a journalist who had been criticising the government and the military was abducted in Lahore and detained without any proper warrant . Similarly, a co founder of an NGO working for the rights of young women was randomly detained and put on an exit control list, restricting her ability to travel overseas.<\/p> <p>Missed Opportunity<\/p> <p>Imran Khan\u2019s inability to take firm action against the oppression of minorities in Pakistan is an indication of their worsening condition in the country. His ostrich approach makes him preach about the inexistent tolerance that Pakistan has for non-Muslims on various<\/p> <p>International forums. It would be wise for him to first start taking constructive steps to improve the situation in his own country before concerning himself with the issues of his next-door neighbour. The tough balancing act that Mr Khan has tried to play between supporting a tolerant Pakistan and the Islamic clerics at the same time has clearly failed. Zahid Hussain, an analyst and author states that Imran Khan, right from the time that he came to power, did want a tolerant Pakistan, but not at the cost of losing support of certain extremist elements. The problem is, instead of carefully balancing the two, he empowered the extremists, nullifying any bit of chance there was for improving the condition of minorities.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3JMNNNO3B3JWZOR6QAKKBARYINJ2WM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":868,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"10","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Arzoo Raja","victim_keywords":"abducted, child","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Simran Kumar","victim_keywords":"abducted","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"minorities","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"10","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Arzoo Raja","victim_keywords":"abducted, child","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Simran Kumar","victim_keywords":"abducted","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"minorities","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1000144791,"Input.title":"Mother, Baby Die After Haiti Gang Kidnaps Doctor","Input.publish_date":"2021-08-20 18:14:58-05:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>(Newser) \u2013 After being hit with a devastating earthquake and then a tropical storm, Haiti clearly did not need this latest problem: Gangs kidnapping doctors.

His health has deteriorated drastically since his imprisonment in May. In November, 60 doctors signed an open letter warning that he could die in prison. He is scheduled to appear in court in February for a hearing to determine whether the United Kingdom will extradite him to the United States where the government has prepared to charge him under the Espionage Act.<\/p> <p>Assange is guilty of nothing more than exposing to the world the US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the infamous Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails of 2016 that revealed the DNC acted illegally to thwart the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders for president. This political vendetta against a journalist, in opposition to international law, is being spearheaded by the US government, military and intelligence agencies.<\/p> <p>The government\u2019s own documents brought to light by Wikileaks have demonstrated that all of the imperialist wars in the Middle East were based on lies. Only last week, Wikileaks released documents revealing serious objections from within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to the watchdog group\u2019s public report of 2019 that blamed Syria\u2019s Assad government for an alleged chlorine gas attack on the Syrian city of Douma in April 2018. The files released by Wikileaks not only suggest that evidence of a chemical attack was planted, but that photos of alleged victims, showing people foaming at the mouth, indicate these people exhibited signs of exposure to sarin gas, not chlorine. The Trump administration used the doctored OPCW report, released well after the fact, to justify the launching of a direct assault on Syria, where Russian forces were stationed in defense of the Assad regime. The attack could have triggered World War III.<\/p> <p>Exposures like this demonstrate just why the US ruling elite are so desperate to destroy Assange and whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning. It was Manning, then an Army private, who leaked over 750,000 classified and unclassified documents to Wikileaks implicating US forces in war crimes in Iraq, including the infamous \u201cCollateral Murder\u201d video. For her principled act, Manning was incarcerated and tortured in US military prisons. Although released in 2017, Manning is back in prison for refusing to testify against Assange.<\/p> <p>All defenders of democratic principles and rights should be concerned with the fates of Assange and Manning. A journalist and a whistleblower, they are being persecuted for revealing to the world the ugly truth about imperialist power.<\/p> <p>But why should teachers in particular come to their defense?<\/p> <p>As teachers know well, public education is under attack, in the US and internationally. This attack is not simply a matter of governmental cost cutting or the privatization of education through for-profit charter schools. The attack on education is an attack on the working class and especially the youth. A government that serves the interests of a wealthy elite fears nothing so much as truth, and the prospect of a truly educated population, capable of dismantling lies and discerning truth, is anathema to such a government. The persecution of Assange and Manning is part of this attack on truth and the working class.<\/p> <p>From overcrowded classrooms to outdated textbooks, from inadequate pay and benefits to dumbed-down curricula, teachers see firsthand the means by which the ruling elite carry out their war on public education. They have also seen how this war has been prosecuted by Democrats and Republicans alike, by Barack Obama and Arne Duncan as surely as by Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.<\/p> <p>Teachers have fought back valiantly in defense of education, not only in their everyday work in the classroom but over the past two years in the form of city-wide and even statewide strikes. These strikes have put demands for quality of education on a par with demands for better pay and benefits, and for this reason have seen overwhelming support from students and parents. But they have not been supported by the politically bankrupt teachers\u2019 unions, which are part of the apparatus of the elite and whose chief purpose is to provide an ever-cheaper work force and to prevent strikes. Predictably, the unions have failed to issue any support to Assange and Manning, but instead are lining up behind various pro-war Democratic candidates for president.<\/p> <p>It is up to teachers to continue the struggle for education and truth, and this means a struggle independent of the traitorous unions.

After reports leaked in April that Abbas might cancel scheduled elections, Banat told The Media Line it was not in the Americans\u2019 interest that \u201ctheir allies, and those who are ready to implement their agendas, lose in the elections or become an ineffective bloc\u201d in the Palestinian Legislative Council.<\/p> <p>Weeks after Abbas announced the postponement of the elections, unidentified gunmen sprayed bullets at Banat\u2019s home in Dura.

The employment of thugs is contrary to the traditions of the Palestinian people and contrary to human rights.\u201d<\/p> <p>Fatah is at a critical junction, and the current events will weaken it further.

This is incitement against me. This means that they want to kill me.\u201d<\/p> <p>The PA wants to convey a message to its critics that what happened to Banat \u201cis the fate reserved for anyone who opens his mouth to criticize the Authority. It is a clear message that the opposition will be liquidated,\u201d Abdeen says.<\/p> <p>The way the security forces dealt with the peaceful demonstrations is proof of this, he says.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey are saying: \u2018Abbas is the head of PA, and whoever says otherwise, we will break his hand,\u2019\u201d Abdeen continues.<\/p> <p>He also criticizes the White House\u2019s and the EU\u2019s policies toward the PA.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe role of the international community is a delicate one. It played a role in reaching this dangerous impasse, because there were calls and a warning that the [PA] judiciary is collapsing. I think that the Europeans and the Americans are partners in this because they do not intervene as needed and their statements are weak, and they still send money to the PA to finance these violations and repression,\u201d Abdeen says.<\/p> <p>Nadia Harhash, a lawyer and human rights activist, told The Media Line the PA has violated every human right.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe repression, dragging and beating of the demonstrators by the security services of the Authority in Ramallah yesterday answers the question of whether the murder of Nizar Banat was an accident or a premeditated one,\u201d she says.<\/p> <p>Like many Palestinians, Harhash questions the rationale for the US and EU backing the PA, saying it will lead to more chaos.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen the Israelis, Americans and Europeans think that their need for this Authority is related to the sacred security coordination,\u201d says Harhash, this gives the \u201cemperors\u201d of the PA \u201cthe green light to repress these people under the pretext of protecting Israel\u2019s security.

And this brutality begins from the moment of arrest and continues to the interrogation phase, the detention phase \u2014 during the whole process children are subject to brutality by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d<\/p> <p>Defense for Children International \u2013 Palestine (DCIP) estimates that Israeli forces detain and prosecute 500 to 700 children between the ages of 12 and 17 every year. According to Addameer, 140 children are currently imprisoned by Israel and two are under administrative detention, where Israeli authorities detain an individual without charge. The reason for the detention is unknown to the detainee and lawyer, and considered a matter of security.<\/p> <p>In some cases of child detention, DCIP said, \u201cIsraeli forces\u2019 treatment may amount to torture.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cNearly three-quarters of children have reported to DCIP that they were subjected to physical violence at the hands of Israeli forces, and close to 60% are verbally abused, humiliated and intimidated, most often during their arrest and subsequent transfer to an interrogation center,\u201d Shaina Low, advocacy officer at DCIP said in an email. She continued:<\/p> <p>Nearly all children (95%) have their hands bound and around 86% are blindfolded. The vast majority of children (85%) are not informed of the reason for arrest, and two-thirds of children are not properly informed of their rights. Nearly all children are interrogated without a parent present, and children have no right to an attorney during interrogation. One third of children report being threatened and coerced into confessing.\u201d<\/p> <p>Yet while detention can be physically tormenting for children, the psychological aspect of it is what stays with children in the long-term.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a social thing for Palestinians,\u201d Addameer\u2019s Ansari said. \u201cWhen children get detained and imprisoned, they become men and it deprives them from living their innocence and imposes on them to become tough and try to overcome the obstacles that they are under.\u201d<\/p> <p>International outcry<\/p> <p>\u201cIt was so disturbing seeing those heavily armed Israeli soldiers detaining small, terrified Palestinian children,\u201d Rep. McCollum told MintPress News. \u201cAs a policymaker, but also as a mother and a grandmother, I was witnessing a state-sponsored action that was intended to inflict trauma on children. It is appalling and it is a human rights abuse.\u201d<\/p> <p>Dylan Williams \u2014 senior vice president of J Street, an American organization advocating for a peaceful solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \u2014 also called the arrest \u201cdisturbing.\u201d<\/p> <p>This is very disturbing. It must be investigated, including whether any of that military equipment is American-made and being used in violation of US law. https:\/\/t.co\/j60p7NNoXC \u2014 Dylan Williams (@dylanotes) March 10, 2021<\/p> <p>\u201cIt must be investigated, including whether any of that military equipment is American-made and being used in violation of U.S. law,\u201d Williams wrote on Twitter.<\/p> <p>Just two days after the controversial arrest, progressive members of Congress sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken two letters pushing for Palestinian rights. The House letter, whose dozen signatories included Rep. McCollum, covered Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, the issue of annexation, and Israel\u2019s obligation under international law to vaccinate all Palestinians. The letter specified:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe request that the State Department undertake an investigation into Israel\u2019s possible use of U.S. equipment in these home demolitions and determine whether these materials have been used in violation of the Arms Export Control Act or any U.S.-Israeli end-use agreements\u2026<\/p> <p>\u201cIsrael\u2019s ongoing colonization of the Palestinian West Bank, including East Jerusalem, alongside its demolition of Palestinian homes, is a form of ongoing, de facto annexation, which needs to be unequivocally opposed by the United States\u2026<\/p> <p>\u201cThe message from this Administration must be clear: settler colonialism in any form \u2014 including Israel\u2019s settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank \u2014 is illegal under international law and will not be tolerated.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Senate letter urged President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to pressure Israel to vaccinate all Palestinians. The letter was signed by five senators, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.<\/p> <p>Traditionally, American politicians have turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s crimes against Palestinians.

They arrived at his home at 4:05pm to enforce the sentence imposed by Guant\u00e1namo city\u2019s People\u2019s Municipal Court, where he was accused of the crimes of resistance and disobedience.<\/p> <p>On 7 August, the journalist was prosecuted and sentenced to a year\u2019s deprivation of liberty, converted to correctional labour with internment, due to his coverage of a trial of public interest. He was arrested and beaten on 22 April by PNR agents in Guant\u00e1namo and he was held for 5 days. On his release he was informed that the legal process against him would continue.<\/p> <p>During his arrest, he suffered a number of contusions, abrasions and wounds and the eardrum of his right ear was perforated. He was taken to the hospital, but the specialist who treated him did not register the injury. His condition was not diagnosed until seven days after his release, when he required medical assistance, which he accessed himself.<\/p> <p>Despite a complaint filed against the officials who caused the injuries, on 30 April the First Military Prosecutor exonerated the agents and forwarded the complaint against the journalist to the Guant\u00e1namo Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The journalist filed a further complaint but to date has not received a response.<\/p> <p>On hearing the sentence imposed by the Municipal Court on 7 August, Roberto Qui\u00f1ones appealed the sentence on 12 August, affirming that it violated his human rights.<\/p> <p>On 13 August, an urgent appeal with 142 signatures, including from Cuban and international human rights organisations, media outlets and journalists, human rights defenders, academics, among others, called on the Cuban State to respect Roberto de Jes\u00fas Qui\u00f1ones Haces\u2019 human rights during the criminal process against him and to adopt measures to end the repression against journalists, human rights defenders and other civil society actor as a result of the exercise of their right to freedom of expression.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, on 20 August the Guant\u00e1namo Provincial Court notified him that there would not be another hearing, even though legally this should occur when an appeal is filed. On 27 August the same Court confirmed the sentence handed down, which was to begin on 5 September, when the journalist was obliged to report for a year\u2019s correctional labour with internment. However, Roberto Qui\u00f1ones did not report for this, as he does not consider himself guilty of the crimes for which he has been sentenced. Consequently, the sentence was amended to detention at a closed prison, which means that he will be deprived of his liberty during one year.<\/p> <p>The current status of this case is a result of a number of different factors, including the fact that the Court of Appeals rejected his appeal for a new hearing \u2013 denying the journalist this recourse and the opportunity to re-establish the guarantees of due process and expose the violations of national legislation.<\/p> <p>The Military Prosecutor also prejudiced the evidence when he stated that the journalist \u201crefused to show his identification\u201d and that the PNR officials had to apply measures to make him obedient. He concluded that Roberto had engaged in criminal behaviour (resistance) which caused the State agents to act, without allowing him an opportunity to defend himself against these allegations. This was confirmed by the Courts of First and Second Instance, in a trial that violated fundamental guarantees of due process, especially the right to defend oneself in court and to be tried by impartial judges.<\/p> <p>The legal basis used by this official is incorrect and contradictory. He alleges that the military personnel did not commit any crime and at the same time exonerated them for the injuries suffered by Roberto. According the Cuban criminal law, when medical treatment is required, it constitutes a criminal offence. The decision to exonerate them based on the conclusion that they were carrying out their duty is invalid, given that this criminal responsibility can only be absolved through a public trial in an independent court.<\/p> <p>It is pertinent to highlight that during the years that Roberto de Jes\u00fas Qui\u00f1ones has dedicated to independent journalism, he has suffered many acts of intimidation, harassment, arbitrary detention, illegal deprivation of liberty, a raid of his home, among other human rights violations. This is not an isolated case, rather it represents the reality faced by independent journalists, human rights defenders and those who fight to defend their rights in Cuba.<\/p> <p>With regard to this particular case, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) denounced Roberto Qui\u00f1ones\u2019 sentence and expressed concern regarding the criminalisation of those who exercise their right to freedom of expression in Cuba, signalling that arbitrary detention has been used as a method of intimidation and harassment of activists, human rights defenders and journalists.<\/p> <p>The IACHR also noted that in 2019 the number of acts of intimidation and harassment of activists, human rights defenders and independent journalists has risen, and that this punishment or intimidation is used to deter them from exercising their right to peacefully voice their opinion, associate and gather.<\/p> <p>To this end, the signatory organisations and social actors denounce the detention of Roberto de Jes\u00fas Qui\u00f1ones Haces, coming as a result of a succession of violations of his human rights, and call for his immediate release.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, we reiterate the call on the State to adopt all necessary measures for the guarantee of free press, thought and expression for journalists, human rights defenders and Cuban society in general.<\/p> <p>Signatories<\/p> <p>Journalists, human rights defenders and others:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3BO3NEOQM2W33W25E89KG11OF0DAIU"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":964,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":"04","date":"22.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cuba","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roberto de Jes\u00fas Qui\u00f1ones Haces","victim_keywords":"journalist, detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":"04","date":"22.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cuba","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roberto de Jes\u00fas Qui\u00f1ones Haces","victim_keywords":"journalist, detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":977871730,"Input.title":"Myanmar junta orders internet blackout as more pro-democracy protesters are detained","Input.publish_date":"2021-04-02 19:04:24","Input.article_interface":"<p>International<\/p> <p>Myanmar junta orders internet blackout as more pro-democracy protesters are detained<\/p> <p>The grandmother of Zaw Ko Latt, who was shot dead on April 1, 2021, by security forces during a crackdown on demonstrations against the military coup, cries beside his coffin during his funeral in Mandalay on April 2, 2021.

With Israel in political disarray of its own after two inconclusive elections, the UK contest has elicited few comments from Israeli leaders despite deep concern among British Jews over Mr Corbyn and media reports that some might opt to emigrate if he wins power. Last week, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the Israeli government had not discussed the prospect of Mr Corbyn's election or the future of intelligence and security ties with Britain should the veteran pro-Palestinian campaigner become PM. But pressed on the issue in an Israeli Army Radio interview today, Mr Katz was more forthcoming as the December 12 ballot approaches. 'I won't meddle in internal elections but I personally hope that he won't be elected, with this whole wave of anti-Semitism...I hope the other side wins,' he said.

When I became leader of the party there were no processes in place to deal with anti-Semitism.'<\/p> <p>He added: 'We introduced an appeals procedure to deal with it and we introduced an education process so that party members understood the hurt that can be caused by anti-Semitic remarks or anti-Semitic behaviour.'<\/p> <p>Mr Corbyn said that the 'total number of cases' of anti-Semitism 'as a proportion of party membership is very, very low indeed' but added that 'one case of anti-Semitism is one too many'.<\/p> <p>'I do not interfere with cases and as I pointed out it's an independent process,' he said.<\/p> <p>A Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'Anti-Semitism is an evil and we are committed to rooting it out of our Party and society.

The winners follow, with brief commentary, in chronological order:<\/p> <p>1. \"We really idolize somebody like Leila Khaled, somebody who actually stands up for herself, speaks for herself, actually goes to a plane and hijacks it.\" Rabab Abdulhadi, professor in Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas\/Race and Resistance Studies at San Francisco State University. Goldengate Express, September 22, 2020.<\/p> <p>Who doesn't get misty-eyed recalling the grand old days of Palestinian airline hijackings? What better way to preserve that glorious legacy than teaching students to idolize the Queen of Terror at 30,000 Feet, Leila Khaled? Back in 1970, Khaled helped hijack an El Al flight but failed to blow it up when her grenade didn't explode. A role model for the ages.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Brown: \"I don't think it's morally evil to own somebody.\"<\/p> <p>2. \"I don't think you can talk about slavery in Islam until you realize that there is no such thing as slavery. . . . Slavery cannot just be treated as a moral evil in and of itself. I don't think it's morally evil to own somebody because we own lots of people all around us. And we're owned by people.\" Jonathan Brown, Alwaleed bin Talal Chair of Islamic Civilization at Georgetown University. From a lecture at the Islamist-run International Institute of Islamic Thought, in IPT News, February 13, 2017.<\/p> <p>Most of us yokels, when asked our opinion on slavery, would condemn it in the strongest possible terms. But most of us don't shoulder the heavy burdens of Jonathan Brown, who lives the double life of university professor and Islamist. How to speak publicly on slavery in Islam, then, while fulfilling dueling identities? Try to muddy the waters so that decent people aren't appalled, but slavery-supporting Islamists won't think you're a sell-out. But Brown blew it by failing to grasp that contemporary slavery isn't a terribly ambiguous issue for normal people. This episode tells us all we need to know about both Brown's common decency and his common sense.<\/p> <p>3. \"Compared to the scale of death and destruction that the U.S. has unleashed on major cities in Afghanistan and Iraq, and later Bashar al-Assad and his nemesis have visited upon Syria, the destruction of those two [World Trade Center] towers now appears as entirely negligible, even remembering them perhaps an insult to the memories of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings maimed and murdered and turned into hopeless refugees in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya or Syria.\" Hamid Dabashi, Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. Published in Al-Jazeera on the fifteenth anniversary of 9\/11, September 11, 2016.<\/p> <p>Hamid Dabashi would be cringe-worthy as a second-rate literary villain. As a chaired professor, he's testimony to academe's moral and intellectual depravity. Unabashedly anti-Semitic, spiteful toward his adopted country, less a revolutionary than shallow narcissist, Dabashi's writings insult the memories of those slaughtered on 9\/11.<\/p> <p>4. \"Israeli complaints that Gaza is controlled by the party-militia, Hamas, freely elected in 2006, and that Hamas fires (mostly small, home-made and ineffectual) rockets into Israel, are irrelevant to the requirement that civilian noncombatants in Gaza be provided with basic staples by the occupying authority.\" Juan Cole, Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan, in the Nation, February 3, 2016.<\/p> <p>You have to have a soft spot in your heart for those upstanding Hamas terrorists. Here they are minding their own business, just trying to kill and terrorize as many Jews as possible by raining thousands of rockets down on civilian populations. But those damned little rockets! Why, they're hardly bigger than roman candles, and it seems no matter how many they launch, they never kill all the Israelis! Thank goodness for truthtellers like Juan Cole!<\/p> <p>Joseph Massad makes the list with a 114-word sentence inscrutable to any sane homo sapien.<\/p> <p>5. \"The imperial complicity of the Gay International, including its Arab members, lies in their calling upon all Arabs who refuse the imperial hegemony of the hetero-homo binary to unlearn and unthink the way they desire, and that they learn and think their desires along the lines of the hetero-homo binary, indeed that the way they exist and the way they are, their very ontology, is a form of false consciousness, which they must shed, as the truth of who they are, according to this logic, lies in their adoption of the imperial hetero-homo binary through which they must apprehend themselves and their desires, which will lead, according to the Gay International, to their emancipation.\" Joseph Massad, associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University. From an interview in Jadaliyya, March 5, 2013.<\/p> <p>We don't know what the hell this means, but Massad seems to decry \"the hetero-homo binary\" as hegemonic, especially in its imperial form, and believes that emancipation requires this very ontology. Or something.<\/p> <p>Juan Cole's fecund imagination runs from \"giant James Bond villains\" to Newt Gingrich with whips and chains.<\/p> <p>6. \"It wasn't the 21-year-old Michael Enright who drunkenly slashed his New York city cab driver after asking 'Are you Muslim?' It was the Republican National Committee. . . . Newt Gingrich and Rick Lazio may as well have kept Enright in their basements in chains and whipped him into a frenzy as to spew their hatred on the airwaves.\" Juan Cole, Richard P. Mitchell Professor of History at the University of Michigan. At his blog Informed Comment, August 25, 2010.<\/p> <p>Most folks would settle for alien abductions, but back in 2010 Cole couldn't shake imagining violent kidnappings. We're not a shrink, so we won't speculate why, but that March he wrote that being a Middle East expert who is ignored in the public arena is like being an MLB player ready for the World Series who's \"kidnapped,\" taken to a \"secret fight club,\" and made to face a \"giant James Bond villain.\" By August, he was fantasizing that Newt and Lazio were into whips and chains. Projection or the heat of summer? You judge.<\/p> <p>7. \"If Jews can get reparations from Germany, then Palestinians should get reparations from Israel. After all, what the Germans supposedly did to the Jews is what Israel is doing to the people of Palestine.\" Susan Slyomovics, professor of anthropology and former director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies (CNES) at UCLA. Spoken during a break at a UCLA conference, via FrontPage Magazine, April 16, 2010.<\/p> <p>Such a sly Susan! We don't mean her pedestrian analogy that Israelis = Nazis, Palestinians = Holocaust victims. Yawn. Every self-respecting Israel hater knows that. But see how she surreptitiously sneaks in \"supposedly\" just when you didn't expect it? It's a two-fer: casting doubt on the veracity of the Holocaust while smearing Jews as the new Nazis. It's a calculated convolution!<\/p> <p>Ebrahim Moosa: \"Wahabism is like the Baptists.\"<\/p> <p>8. \"Wahabism is like the Baptists; it's kind of a denomination of sorts that started out in Saudi Arabia.\" Ebrahim Moosa, then at Duke University, now Mirza Family Professor of Islamic Thought & Muslim Societies at the University of Note Dame. As reported in the Charlotte Observer, February 25, 2010.<\/p> <p>The rank disingenuousness of Moosa's claim is seen in a quote from the great historian Bernard Lewis. In illustrating the power that Wahhabi Islam gained during the twentieth century, Lewis said: \"Imagine that the Ku Klux Klan gets total control of the state of Texas. And the Ku Klux Klan has at its disposal all the oil rigs in Texas. And they use this money to set up a well-endowed network of colleges and schools throughout Christendom, peddling their peculiar brand of Christianity. You would then have an approximate equivalent of what has happened in the modern Muslim world.\"<\/p> <p>9. \"I do not find any evidence that makes me agree that Osama bin Laden was behind the attack on the twin trade towers. All we have heard from him was simply a praise and commendation of those who had carried out the operation.\" Natana DeLong-Bas, then a lecturer at Boston College and Brandeis University, now associate professor of theology at BC. From a December 21 2006 interview in Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, translated by MEMRI, January 2, 2007.<\/p> <p>Careful scholars are hesitant to pass judgment on people or events before they've sifted all the evidence, and by late 2006 our intrepid professor hadn't finished her primary source research on the events of over half a decade before. We would love to know what other hypotheses she's studied: was it the Bilderbergers, the Masons, or the Mossad? Hopefully, the long wait for an answer from DeLong-Bas will end soon. Enlighten us, professor!<\/p> <p>Former PLO spokesman Rashid Khalidi: \"For American Likudniks and their Israeli counterparts ...

From In These Times, January 27, 2003.<\/p> <p>Listen, as a former PLO spokesman in the 1980s, Khalidi's job was to be on top of all the intel, so when he says that Likudniks were happy about 9\/11, we take him at his word.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"36QZ6V158BSCCJJZPPKPK4J5V48SUN"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":201,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1014024714,"Input.title":"10 Heinous Cases Of Misconduct By Crime Investigators","Input.publish_date":"2015-02-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The integrity of the criminal justice system is intimately intertwined with the belief that we can trust the analysis of crime scene evidence.

A graduate of West Virginia State College, Zain had only managed to pass some of his chemistry courses by the skin of his teeth, while utterly failing in others. Somehow, these flashing signs of inability didn\u2019t prevent him from landing jobs as a police chemist for the state of West Virginia and chief of physical evidence in Bexar County, Texas. But they may explain why Zain spent the duration of his forensics career habitually faking lab results and lying to courtrooms in order to secure criminal convictions.<\/p> <p>Over a span of 13 years, prosecutors in two states sought out Zain\u2019s ostensibly expert opinions, never questioning the fact that he managed to produce evidence with a certainty that other lab technicians couldn\u2019t approach.

While some of those men were exonerated, the exact number of cases influenced by Zain is unknowable. And, from what is known, it\u2019s clear that Zain\u2019s dissembling reach was tremendous.<\/p> <p>In West Virginia alone, Zain may have lied in as many as 182 different cases. And in addition to his work in a Texas crime lab, Zain served as a forensics consultant to 10 other states, creating the possibility that he lied across thousands of primarily rape and murder trials. As one would expect, the costs of cleaning up after the trail of investigative mayhem have been astronomical. West Virginia alone paid $6.5 million in compensation to innocent people convicted by Zain\u2019s deception, and the state of Texas shelled out $850,000.<\/p> <p>For Zain\u2019s many victims, exoneration and compensation are the only justice possible. Fred Zain died of cancer after the first attempt at holding him accountable for his misdeeds ended in mistrial, and before retrial could begin. One can only hope that, in time, his legacy will evolve into one of wrongs righted by a wiser justice system, rather than the virulent injustices he authored.<\/p> <p>9 FBI Agent Repeatedly Steals And Fails To Report Evidence<\/p> <p>Though movies and media headlines have taught society to view police officers with an ample (but arguably healthy dose) of suspicion, pop culture\u2019s treatment of the FBI has been comparatively favorable. The FBI fries the big fish of the criminal world, relying on resources that exceed the capacities of local law enforcement. And a certain heightened credibility comes with that. But, when an agent like Matthew Lowry is caught getting high on heroin that he stole from an FBI crime lab, that credence suffers greatly.<\/p> <p>The son of a Sunday school teacher, a long-time law enforcement officer, and an honors graduate of the FBI Academy, Lowry was not exactly the spitting image of drug addiction. Yet, at some point during his five years as a Washington, D.C. FBI agent, he lost his way and was eventually found at the wheel of an FBI vehicle under the influence of drugs. In that moment, Lowry single-handedly torpedoed the prosecutions of at least 28 alleged drug offenders, many of whom are thought to be part of dangerous gangs, and he potentially compromised an additional 150 cases. While he has not been charged yet, he has been suspended while the authorities investigate these allegations.<\/p> <p>The bulk of Lowry\u2019s offenses entailed checking out drugs stored at the FBI lab as trial evidence, and returning them with altered weights after days, and sometimes months, of delay. But, in at least one other instance, he failed to submit marijuana and guns seized during a crime, and there is some cause to believe that he may have been involved in the displacement of $130,000 confiscated during an FBI search. But, like so many corruption cases, Lowry\u2019s greatest crime may not be one which exists on any US law book.<\/p> <p>Lowry\u2019s unchecked indiscretions fly in the face of claims that the FBI has a rigorous drug testing policy and raise numerous questions about why the length of time he held onto evidence wasn\u2019t questioned, ultimately implicating the FBI as an irresponsible actor. As the defense attorney for an alleged narcotics kingpin opined, \u201cIt stands to reason that the strict chain of custody claimed by the government in most cases is a sham.\u201d<\/p> <p>8 CSI Chief Tilts Murder Scene Evidence In Favor Of the Prosecution<\/p> <p>The abbreviation \u201cCSI\u201d has become a household term to capture the magic of Hollywood\u2019s high-tech vision of forensic work. But, for residents of Douglas County, Nebraska, those three letters could just as easily stand for \u201cCriminal Subterfuge in Investigations\u201d thanks to disgraced David Kofoed, whose tenure as chief of the local CSI division was marred by the willful manipulation of DNA evidence in a series of murder cases.<\/p> <p>The case, which earned Kofoed his first and greatest encounter with infamy, revolved around the suspects in a double murder: Nicolas Sampson and Matt Livers. Over the course of an 11-hour interrogation, local authorities managed to force a false confession from Livers, who is mentally disabled and eventually buckled under the pressure and repeated threats of incarceration.<\/p> <p>To buttress law enforcement accusations, Kofoed planted traces of blood which tied the suspects to the murder scene, ultimately securing a guilty verdict in court. However, additional evidence later led authorities to the actual perpetrators of the double homicide and exposed Kofoed\u2019s deception.<\/p> <p>The retribution was prompt and costly. In addition to spending more than two years in prison for his misdeeds, Kofoed was slapped with a lawsuit for playing God with Sampson\u2019s and Livers\u2019s lives. A civil court awarded the plaintiffs a total of $6.5 million\u2014a gesture which is more symbolic than practical in light of Kofoed\u2019s inability to pay the fine.<\/p> <p>Subsequent exploration of Kofoed\u2019s other cases revealed a pattern of dubious handiwork. In 2003, Kofoed linked Ivan Henk to the murder of four-year-old Brendan Gonzales with what was likely a manufactured blood sample that prompted Henk\u2019s arrest and eventual guilty plea. In 2006, he faked DNA evidence that was used to solve the murder of Jessica O\u2019Grady. On the the basis of falsified evidence, her presumed killer, Christopher Edwards, may now have legal grounds to overturn an otherwise convincing murder conviction. Ironically, the work of a man determined to secure criminal convictions, regardless of innocence, may allow an apparently guilty man to go free.<\/p> <p>7 Sex Crimes Investigators Alter And Neglect Evidence In Over A Dozen Rape Cases<\/p> <p>Second only to Sherlock Holmes and Batman, Scotland Yard is what people associate with excellence in detective work. And, for a time, its Sapphire sex crimes unit was expected to be no exception. But when the unit faced blistering criticism over a barrage of bungles that allowed a prolific rapist to prey on more than 70 women and another to victimize up to 102 people, a number of Sapphire investigators categorized cases incorrectly, attempting to artificially reduce the number of unsolved sexual assaults.<\/p> <p>According to a 2010 investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), a detective constable and two trainees revised the statement of a rape survivor to suggest that she had retracted her claims. This blatant falsification of a crime report, the IPCC found, was part of a concerted effort by senior officials in the Sapphire unit to improve the rate of solved rape cases in part by recording a higher number of non-offenses.<\/p> <p>The grim implications of such a callous disregard for the law were clear: In order to improve the Sapphire unit\u2019s image, these three men were willing to deny victims justice and permit violent predators to roam free among the vulnerable. And they weren\u2019t alone in this scandal.<\/p> <p>In a separate, more jarring, example of wanton duplicity, detective constable Ryan Coleman-Farrow, another member of the allegedly elite Sapphire unit, simply declined to pursue the claims of at least 12 women who reported sexual assaults between 2007 and 2010. Over the course of this three-year period, Coleman-Farrow not only neglected to interview suspects, but also forged victim statements, allowed video evidence to remain untouched, and failed to bring forensic evidence to the proper channels. As a result, the cases against 11 suspected rapists have gone cold, perhaps never to be solved.<\/p> <p>In the face of brazen inaction by Scotland Yard\u2019s sex crimes investigators, a drastic rejiggering of the force followed. The Sapphire unit was merged with the Metropolitan police force\u2019s child abuse division, and bolstered with 100 additional officers in what was essentially a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d for what was supposed to be a world-class collection of crime solvers.<\/p> <p>6 New York Police Plant Drugs On Innocent People To Fill Arrest Quotas<\/p> <p>In 2008, Brooklyn cops were caught siphoning off drugs confiscated in arrests which, for many observers, would constitute a textbook case of crooked policing. But, according to law enforcement, those drugs were being used to pay informants for information that would lead to major arrests in a case of \u201cnoble cause corruption.\u201d Three years later, the public was blindsided by the news that the tale of evil woven by New York\u2019s finest was also a cover for the intentional arrest of innocent people.<\/p> <p>In hindsight, one might characterize the scandal as a logical offshoot of the very system which condemns its criminality. With police performance measured in numbers of arrests, officers who failed to book enough criminals risked such penalties as being removed from undercover assignments. According to Officer Steve Anderson, who himself was caught partaking in the scheme, this translated into undercover narcotics agents handing over some of the drugs purchased during covert operations to officers who were struggling to meet arrest quotas. Those struggling used the extra drugs to frame innocent people.<\/p> <p>Anderson\u2019s account of the illegal evidence planting operation wasn\u2019t enough to convict every officer he claimed had framed innocent people to pad their arrest numbers. But the evidence of his wrongdoing, along with the actions of other Brooklyn officers, was enough to throw out 400 different drug cases and secure the release of over two dozen people wrongfully arrested on drug charges. In addition to bearing the financial burden of revisiting tainted convictions, the government has agreed to award $1,000 for each hour of wrongful incarceration endured by an innocent person, leading to compensation for at least 25 people believed to have been booked on bad evidence.<\/p> <p>Some costs, however, may be incalculable. The reputation of Brooklyn\u2019s officers has been doubly besmirched, as not only had they likely been arresting innocent people for years as a matter of convenience, but they covered up that behavior by casting themselves as heroic wrongdoers when, in reality, they were simply doing wrong.<\/p> <p>5 New York State Troopers Fake Fingerprint Evidence For Nearly A Decade<\/p> <p>In 1989, the Harris family of Dryden, New York became the victims of a grisly murder. The family of four was bound and gagged, a 15-year-old female raped and tortured, and the whole family shot in the head before their home was set on fire. Two people were convicted and imprisoned for that brutal affair: Michael Kinge and his mother, Shirley.<\/p> <p>But, after spending two and a half years of a 17- to 44-year sentence behind bars for burglary and arson, Shirley Kinge was released. Fingerprint evidence that tied her to gasoline cans used in the arson had been planted by New York State Troopers.<\/p> <p>Shirley Kinge\u2019s plight was one of at least 36 instances of evidence planting perpetrated by members of the New York State Troopers\u2019 C Division and at least one member of Troop F. Between 1984 and 1992, members of New York State Troopers\u2019 C Division, and at least one member of Troop F, systematically fabricated fingerprints and other evidence. And, for those eight years\u2014which is a long time to get away with any crime\u2014those troopers helped decide thousands of felony cases across more than half a dozen counties across New York.<\/p> <p>At the heart of the scandal were five forensic investigators from Troop C. According to investigators, these individuals benefited from a culture of lax, and even tacitly complicit, oversight that nurtured a felonious hubris. A sixth officer, situated in Troop F, had long known the other five perpetrators and undoubtedly shared in their criminal nonchalance, even planting evidence in one instance where a conviction would have been secured without it.<\/p> <p>Troop C\u2019s incorrigible corruption might have gone unchecked were it not for a miscalculation by former trooper David Harding. While interviewing with the CIA, Harding touted his evidence planting exploits as an example of his ability to conduct covert operations, somehow failing to comprehend that admitting to a string of serious crimes might get him in trouble with the government. The ensuing investigation resulted in guilty pleas from five troopers and a criminal conviction of the sixth. But perhaps the most significant outcome was a rule change requiring more rigorous checks to confirm fingerprint evidence.<\/p> <p>4 Delaware Drug Lab Compromises Thousands Of Cases Through Sloppiness And Theft<\/p> <p>In January 2014\u2014mere weeks after the world welcomed a new year with celebratory optimism\u2014prosecutors throughout Delaware faced a legal nightmare that would haunt the foreseeable future. It began during the trial of a suspected Oxycontin dealer, when the court discovered that confiscated drugs had vanished and been replaced with heart medication. In the months that followed, investigators revealed a pattern of malfeasance and unprofessionalism that would tax and tarnish Delaware\u2019s criminal proceedings.<\/p> <p>Between 2010 and 2012, there were over 50 thefts from the state Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. Sometimes, the stolen items were replaced with false evidence. But, in truth, the lab had been plagued by corruption long before those thefts ever occurred. And a big part of the problem could be pinned on the man running the show: Chief Medical Examiner Richard Callery.<\/p> <p>Helmsman of the drug lab for nearly two decades, and himself suspected of professional improprieties, Callery had overseen a spate of irresponsible hiring decisions. One of the drug thieves, James Woodson, was hired despite allegations that he had stolen evidence from the New Castle Police Department in Delaware. In 2006, the lab rehired a forensic analyst who previously resigned under suspicion of falsifying data. And, in another case of negligence, Callery failed to fire a chemist who had failed required proficiency tests.<\/p> <p>With a team of criminals and incompetents running the drug lab, unconscionable misconduct ensued. For 14 years, the lab relied on malfunctioning equipment that incorrectly logged all evidence entry dates as January 1, 1970. In another instance, a former employee had managed to hold onto an evidence locker pass key six years after leaving the job. And some of the lab\u2019s forensic data is believed to have been falsified. The overwhelming evidence of lab misconduct has already resulted in the dismissal of 200 drug cases and reduced sentences in 60 more. But that\u2019s only the beginning. An additional 500 convictions are slated to be challenged with thousands more in the works.<\/p> <p>3 The Philadelphia PD\u2019s Narcotics Unit Resembles A Mafia Operation<\/p> <p>Every city has ignominious chapters in its history that it would rather forget. For Philadelphia, one of those chapters is undoubtedly devoted to its 39th district police officers. In a scandal that broke on the heels of extensive efforts to reform Philadelphia\u2019s habitually corrupt police force, the officers of the 39th shocked the conscience of Philadelphia with tales of false arrests, evidence tampering, violence, and even theft.<\/p> <p>Everyone from criminals to harmless grandmothers were targets of the 39th district, as feared figures like the infamous John Baird ran roughshod over mostly poor black citizens with virtual legal impunity for years. Individuals like 54-year-old Betty Patterson spent three years in prison on false charges of selling cocaine thanks to planted evidence. Over the course of a 14-year career, Baird was the target of nearly two dozen official complaints related to his propensity for police brutality, inflated criminal charges, robbing drug dealers, and the wholesale planting of narcotic evidence on innocent people\u2014an impressive list of evils to say the least.<\/p> <p>But, despite even the presence of eyewitnesses who could attest to grotesque law enforcement misconduct, charges leveled against Baird and other officers were consistently dismissed as baseless until Philadelphia investigators and federal agents finally began pursuing the matter in 1991. The exploits of the 39th district eventually made media headlines in the mid-1990s. In the years that followed, more than 1,400 cases were reviewed, hundreds of convictions overturned, and $5 million in compensation was awarded to victims of the police. In addition, eight officers were ultimately convicted for their crimes, reversing a longstanding trend of wrongfully incarcerating innocent people in the city of the Liberty Bell.<\/p> <p>But, despite the laudable efforts of local and federal officials to stem the tide of narcotic officer corruption in Philadelphia, rampant corruption is alive and well on the streets of Philadelphia. In 2014, a group of police officers was apprehended after executing a vicious extortion plot that involved kidnapping, threats, and even holding criminal suspects out of windows. Apparently, old habits die hard.<\/p> <p>2 Houston Crime Lab Has A Long History Of Shoddy Lab Work And Biased Testimony<\/p> <p>In the state of Texas, America\u2019s death penalty capital, forensic analysts weighing in on cases of rape and murder literally tip the scales in favor of life or death for a defendant. It\u2019s a grim burden that grows ever heavier in light of the fact that, for decades, the Houston Police Department crime lab has relied on faulty DNA analyses and bogus courtroom testimony that, according to a lab director, have tainted at least 5,000 to 10,000 cases.<\/p> <p>Forensic analyst James Bolding demonstrated overwhelming incompetence and willful dishonesty in his work, appearing not to grasp even the basics of blood sample analysis, while providing courtroom testimony that wrongfully imprisoned men like George Rodriguez, who languished behind bars for 17 years for a rape he didn\u2019t commit, and Josiah Sutton, who was wrongly incarcerated for four years.<\/p> <p>Bolding, and the hundreds of cases he compromised, were emblematic of a culture of inadequacy at the Houston crime lab, where numerous technicians knowingly conducted unreliable analyses in a lab which itself was woefully sub-par. Disorganization was rife, and records were regularly falsified. Even before the shoddy evidence testing began, samples were often contaminated via a leaky roof.<\/p> <p>With examples of misconduct extending into the 1980s, the Houston crime lab precipitated a lengthy reign of errors that has led to two mandatory shutdowns. In 2002, the facility was closed due to unacceptably shoddy lab work and, in 2008, an internal affairs probe uncovered evidence of cheating on lab proficiency tests, resulting in a second closure.<\/p> <p>Then, 2014 brought yet another wave of criticism when another forensic analyst resigned after revelations that he eschewed lab protocols and falsified official records, casting an all-too-familiar doubt on roughly 180 criminal cases.<\/p> <p>With the rate of laboratory malfeasance far outpacing the capacity of authorities to address it, we may never fully ascertain just how many lives were ruined or potentially lost thanks to the Houston Police Department\u2019s forensic infractions. But the sheer scale of ineptitude and invalidation wrought by this crime lab arguably rivals the grievous nature of the crimes it was tasked with solving.<\/p> <p>1 Lab Tech Annie Dookhan Faked Up To 60,000 Drug Sample Analyses<\/p> <p>For nine years, Annie Dookhan worked as a crime lab chemist in Massachusetts, performing drug tests for criminal cases. And, in that capacity, she seemingly set a bar for excellence that was prohibitively high. Over her career, Dookhan completed as many as 60,000 analyses, making her partly responsible for an estimated 11,000 criminal convictions. All the while, she outpaced her colleagues in productivity, sometimes by a factor of three. Unfortunately, Dookhan wasn\u2019t some laboratory wunderkind with a passion for drug offenses. In fact, she didn\u2019t even have the master\u2019s degree she claimed to have earned. Rather, she had been faking test results at a rate of thousands per year.<\/p> <p>In some ways, it can be said that Dookhan was just giving her superiors what they wanted. In the results-driven world of laboratory work, her virtually inhuman ability to amass test results placed Dookhan in a position of distinction. Few questioned it when, in 2010, as her lab saw a drastic decrease in the number of drug analyses completed, Dookhan\u2019s output skyrocketed, accounting for an astounding 31 percent of all the evidence processed by her lab\u201410,933 samples in all.<\/p> <p>When she testified on the witness stand to voice her certainty of a defendant\u2019s guilt in a drug case, no one suspected that she was sometimes adding cocaine to evidence samples to produce incriminating results. The consequences of that complacency have been devastating for Massachusetts.<\/p> <p>Since the discovery of Dookhan\u2019s conduct, at least 1,100 criminal cases have been dropped or dismissed and at least $8.5 million has been spent attempting to account for her mountain of faked lab data. In addition to the untold numbers of people who have been convicted on faulty evidence, a fair number of known violent drug offenders have also been released, leading to an increase in the crime rate and time spent rearresting offenders released because of fabricated evidence.<\/p> <p>In the wake of the legal, ethical, and financial chaos wrought by Annie Dookhan, her punishment may strike many as light. After pleading guilty to perjury, obstruction of justice, and evidence tampering, she received a prison sentence of three to five years, followed by two years of probation. In the meantime, the criminal justice system will be left to clean up the countless messes caused by a single person with too much incentive to lie and too little oversight.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"36D1BWBEHPG0UCXSM8EX2CP7KOMM22"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"e365eb66-c5f8-42de-9298-f3cba96a4e2e","work_time_in_seconds":3027,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"2010","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fred Zain","victim_keywords":"forensics","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ryan Coleman-Farrow","victim_keywords":"detective constable","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Annie Dookhan","victim_keywords":"Chemist","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Richard Callery","victim_keywords":"Chief Medical Examiner","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Michael Kinge","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Shirley","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"2010","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fred Zain","victim_keywords":"forensics","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ryan Coleman-Farrow","victim_keywords":"detective constable","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Annie Dookhan","victim_keywords":"Chemist","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Richard Callery","victim_keywords":"Chief Medical Examiner","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Michael Kinge","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Shirley","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":906700659,"Input.title":"MENA: Renewed wave of mass uprisings met with brutality and repression during \u2018year of defiance\u2019","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-18 11:00:01","Input.article_interface":"<p>Report reviews human rights in 19 MENA states during 2019<\/p> <p>Wave of protests across Algeria, Iraq, Iran and Lebanon demonstrates reinvigorated faith in people power<\/p> <p>500+ killed in Iraq and over 300 in Iran in brutal crackdowns on protests<\/p> <p>Relentless clampdown on peaceful critics and human rights defenders<\/p> <p>At least 136 prisoners of conscience detained in 12 countries for online speech<\/p> <p>Governments across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) displayed a chilling determination to crush protests with ruthless force and trample over the rights of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets to call for social justice and political reform during 2019, said Amnesty International today, publishing its annual report on the human rights situation in the region.<\/p> <p>Human rights in the Middle East and North Africa: Review of 2019 describes how instead of listening to protesters\u2019 grievances, governments have once again resorted to relentless repression to silence peaceful critics both on the streets and online.

Authorities also abused their powers to stop people accessing or sharing information online. During protests in Iran, the authorities implemented a near-total internet shutdown to stop people sharing videos and photos of security forces unlawfully killing and injuring protesters. In Egypt, authorities disrupted online messaging applications in an attempt to thwart further protests. Egyptian and Palestinian authorities also resorted to censoring websites including news websites. In Iran social media apps including Facebook, Telegram, Twitter and YouTube remained blocked.<\/p> <p>Some governments also use more sophisticated techniques of online surveillance to target human rights defenders. Amnesty\u2019s research highlighted how two Moroccan human rights defenders were targeted using spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group.

The announcement by the International Criminal Court (ICC) that war crimes had been committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and that an investigation should be opened as soon as the ICC\u2019s territorial jurisdiction has been confirmed offered a crucial opportunity to end decades of impunity. The ICC indicated that the investigation could cover Israel\u2019s killing of protesters in Gaza.<\/p> <p>The fact that governments across MENA have a zero-tolerance approach to peaceful online expression shows how they fear the power of ideas that challenge official narratives.

Saudi Arabia introduced long-overdue reforms to its male guardianship system, but these were overshadowed by the fact that five women human rights defenders remained unjustly detained for their activism throughout 2019.<\/p> <p>Governments across the region must learn that their repression of protests and imprisonment of peaceful critics and human rights defenders will not silence people\u2019s demands for fundamental economic, social and political rights Heba Morayef<\/p> <p>A number of Gulf states also announced reforms to improve protection for migrant workers including promises from Qatar to abolish its kafala (sponsorship system) and improve migrants\u2019 access to justice.

Hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis took to the Pearl Roundabout to demand political reform on 14 February 2011. The turnout was proportionally one of the greatest shows of \"people power\" in modern history, and was brutally repressed by Bahraini authorities.<\/p> <p>Despite hollow promises for political reform, most of the demands for greater democratic reform by protesters remain unmet 10 years on. If anything, repression has gotten worse. The election of Joe Biden brings some hope of a hiatus, rather than a substantive change, but Bahrain remains at the mercy of a ruthless government backed by allies willing to turn a blind eye.<\/p> <p>Foreign affairs dictate repression<\/p> <p>Repression in Bahrain is intimately tied to foreign policy. Bahrain has always been dependent on foreign powers for protection, whether Britain, Saudi Arabia or the US. British diplomat Roger Tomkys said in 1982, \"Revolution in Bahrain will never be possible so long as the Kingdom of Saudi remains intact.\"<\/p> <p>Britain, Bahrain's former imperial suzerain, has continued to support repression in Bahrain<\/p> <p>In many ways, this was true, in 2011 the arrival across the Causeway of mostly Saudi troops from the Gulf Peninsula Shield force was the death knell for the Bahrain uprising. Dozens of Bahrainis were killed through torture or police violence, with hundreds put in prison following military trials.<\/p> <p>But it's not just Saudi Arabia. Britain, Bahrain's former imperial suzerain, has continued to support repression in Bahrain under the pretext of reforming its police. Most recently, the University of Huddersfield came under fire after opposition activists complained they were tortured on its Bahrain premises by the very police being trained by the UK.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, the US administration determines who lives and who dies in Bahrain. Since 2011, the Bahrain authorities have issued several death sentences in court cases widely criticised for violations of due process and procedure. Under Obama, the Bahrain government paid lip service to human rights reforms and did not execute anyone sentenced to death, for fear of riling the Obama administration. But the election of Trump changed everything.<\/p> <p>His administration's maximum pressure campaign on Iran meant Bahrain's government had the green light to do as they pleased with anyone they accused of acting in collusion with Iran - which was basically any opposition member.<\/p> <p>Bahrain executed three men in January 2017, the month of Trump's inauguration. Another eight Bahrainis were shot and killed before June 2017, marking the deadliest year since 2011. A further three were executed in 2019.<\/p> <p>Read more: Social media fuelled the Arab Spring, then helped dictators quash it<\/p> <p>As well as brute force, the Al Khalifa ruling family has long played with and manipulated the social fabric of Bahrain. By aggravating sectarian tensions through rhetoric and the destruction of Shia religious structures, it has attempted to divide a broad based opposition coalition by fanning the flames of religious acrimony.<\/p> <p>Legal and political avenues for participatory democracy have also narrowed in the past 10 years. The government has closed the country's largest political party Al Wefaq, and clamped down on independent media such as the newspaper Al Wasat.<\/p> <p>Hundreds of political prisoners swept up under the broad pretext of national security languish in jail. The Ministry of the Interior even announced that following someone on social media deemed anti-government could result in a jail sentence.<\/p> <p>A new hope?<\/p> <p>The past year brought a false dawn. The world's longest serving and hawkish prime minister Khalifa bin Salman died in November 2020, prompting hope that his successor, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, would usher in a new era of reforms.<\/p> <p>After all, it's not uncommon in Bahrain for the death of a key political figurehead to bring about change. The same happened in Bahrain in 1999, when Sheikh isa bin Salman Al Khalifa died. His son, Hamad, made himself King but also promised a new period of political liberalisation in the form of the national charter - when actually it was a constitutional coup.<\/p> <p>The arrival of mostly Saudi troops was the death knell for the Bahrain uprising<\/p> <p>While many expected an elected unilateral parliament, they got a bicameral system with an upper house appointed by the king. The Al Khalifa remained firmly in charge.<\/p> <p>The brief period of political liberalisation that allowed the formation of political parties did not stop continued corruption, problems with housing allocation, and economic troubles. These problems, which underscored the 2011 uprising, have not gone away.<\/p> <p>As it stands, the limits of political liberalisation have been reached in Bahrain. While the election of US President Joe Biden might put the brakes on the more egregious excesses of repression, the regime, ever deferential to its increasingly autocratic allies in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has little incentive to enact top-down change.<\/p> <p>Marc Owen Jones is an assistant professor in Middle East studies and digital humanities at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Doha, and an honorary research fellow at Exeter University.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"379OL9DBSUTBOD75QKHN6UKSZ4AY9W"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":387,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","torture"],"year":"2011","month":"February","date":"14.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Bahrain","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protesters, Pearl Roundabout, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"executed by the state, 2017, 2019","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"social media, activists, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","torture"],"year":"2011","month":"February","date":"14.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Bahrain","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protesters, Pearl Roundabout, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"executed by the state, 2017, 2019","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"social media, activists, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1007665834,"Input.title":"Marcos called out by 1Sambayan: \u2018Stop lies, historical distortions\u2019","Input.publish_date":"2021-10-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Opposition coalition 1Sambayan on Tuesday, Oct. 5, called out former Senator Bongbong Marcos, the son of the late President Ferdinand Marcos and who announced his presidential bid, to stop distorting the truth about the dark days of his family\u2019s Martial Law era.<\/p> <p>1Sambayan (Photo courtesy of Neri Colmenares)<\/p> <p>Marcos announced his candidacy for president in the 2022 polls, 35 years after his family left the country in the throes of a people-backed military revolt that ended his father\u2019s almost 21 years in power.<\/p> <p>\u201cStop the lies and stop the historical distortions, Bongbong!

Leaving aside his need to portray the Government as a failure, one must pay attention to the remarks he made vis-a-vis the military. That he makes his references to the military in his opening remarks itself makes this exercise important.<\/p> <p>The Opposition Leader notes that national security in its broad sense includes many aspects. The first element he declares is military security. Taking the recent incident involving the discovery of a hand grenade at All Saints Church in Borella, he builds his case that the military security under this Government has failed.<\/p> <p>Cardinal\u2019s Misgivings<\/p> <p>Soon after the bomb was discovered, Cardinal Ranjith called a press conference to air his misgivings with the ongoing investigation. His contention was the Police did not seem to take into account a person who was in church that morning.<\/p> <p>Unwittingly, the Cardinal revealed certain facts the investigators were unwilling to make public at the time. Nevertheless, the Police were able to track the perpetrator \u2014 a septuagenarian, obviously disturbed by bitter memories. The Cardinal, perhaps embarrassed, has not retracted his accusations \u2013 especially as the perpetrator claims to have had suffered discrimination at the hands of the church.<\/p> <p>The Cardinal\u2019s comments irked Defence Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne. However, the need is for both the Cardinal and the Government to work on their deteriorating trust issues. Both need to understand that our country is not at a juncture where we can afford to let our ego get in the way.<\/p> <p>Capitalising on the Cardinal\u2019s apprehensions, the Opposition Leader claims that military security has failed. The military, however, does not play a role in this bomb incident. This is a matter entirely for the Police.<\/p> <p>Even the dastardly Easter Attacks came under the purview of the TID, SIS and CID. The role the MI played was minimal. Even the underworld uses bombs and worse. Still, it is the Police that must deal with it and not the military. Therefore, the reason for a learned man who takes mighty pride in his knowledge to state the military had failed on a matter that concerns the Police is curious.<\/p> <p>This accusation itself is absurd. During the past two years, the entire world was crippled by the pandemic. Sri Lanka, however, managed better than most countries and that was because of the enormous service rendered by the military right from the onset.<\/p> <p>For instance, Sri Lanka\u2019s vaccination programme has been tremendously successful. For a short while, it was in danger of being foiled because of trade union actions. However, the military took over the vaccination programme and did a far more efficient job. Today, not even vaccine producing countries like the US or India has the kind of record Sri Lanka has achieved. This was only possible because of the military. Yet, not once during his long speech did the Opposition Leader acknowledge the strength of the military and the services rendered by them to our country.<\/p> <p>Therefore, we must understand the reason for Sajith Premadasa to attack on the military in the opening remarks itself. He may have broken away from the UNP and distanced himself from Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, it is clear that he has not distanced himself from the agenda the UNP undertook when forming the Yahapalana Government.<\/p> <p>The Yahapalana Grudge<\/p> <p>A defining feature of the Yahapalana Government was its relentless persecution of the military, mostly the Military Intelligence (MI). Entire MI teams were detained by the CID, which was then headed by the politically corrupt SSP Shani Abeysekera. In addition, the then Yahapalana Government tried its level best to throw behind bars the top military brass that gave leadership to end terrorism in the Island.<\/p> <p>Among this target list were incumbent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who functioned as the Defence Secretary, highly-decorated Major General K.A.D. Amal Karunasekara who functioned as the Director Military Intelligence, Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda who was the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy and Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne. Both Major General Karunasekara and Admiral Wijegunaratne were ignominiously detained by the CID over charges built on flimsy evidence.<\/p> <p>For instance, Major General Karunasekara was arrested by the CID in April 2018 over the abduction and assault of a national newspaper\u2019s Associate Editor in May 2008. Much publicity was given to the investigation team that flew to Australia, where he now domiciled, to get his statement. However, very little Media coverage was given to his statement itself, which stated the investigators were after the wrong men. Yet, it took months more before the CID reluctantly released eight serving and former officers of the Directorate of Military Intelligence. The case, after dancing in the Media for 18 months quietly slithered away.<\/p> <p>Ramanayake\u2019s Treacherous Task<\/p> <p>Likewise, all these cases that targeted the MI were projected as high profile despite the paucity of evidence. The investigators could not furnish enough evidence to even file a b-report. Yet, they were exposed to the full glare of the Media. They were thus humiliated disregarding the enormous service rendered by these individuals during and after the war to usher and ensure peace in the country.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, every single officer and man that was thus arrested had played a pivotal role in defeating the LTTE. Furthermore, some were still engaged in defending the country from attempts to revive the terrorist group.<\/p> <p>The LTTE\u2019s international network is still very active across the world. This entity that propagated the LTTE ideology bought sympathy for its macabre cause by getting politicians and journalists to delve deep in to their pockets. They funded terrorist activities in Sri Lanka and India which still continue to haunt us.<\/p> <p>The MI unit that shadowed these activities was arrested in 2015 over the disappearance of a supposedly tabloid journalist Prageeth Eknalogoda, who was unknown until his disappearance. To date, investigators do not know if his disappearance was voluntary or not. Apart from his estranged wife, who gained publicity and perhaps monetary assistance, no one else benefited from his disappearance. In fact, he only became famous because his disappearance is something of a mystery. Therefore, his importance to the MI or their need for him to disappear has not yet been established.<\/p> <p>Subsequently, recorded telephone conversations between former MP Ranjan Ramanayake and SSP Abeysekera revealed the political motivation behind these arrests. Ramanayaka, who is currently serving a four-year prison sentence for contempt of court, claims that he had never stolen from the public.<\/p> <p>Be that as it may, the role he played was far worse in persecuting opponents of the Yahapalana Government. From his own recordings, he exposed the political favours he promised judges and his manipulation of the CID\u2019s functions and investigations through the Director of the CID himself.<\/p> <p>Thus, it is extremely distasteful when SLPP MPs as Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgama and Geetha Kumarasinghe support the SJB\u2019s call for a presidential pardon for Ramanayake. Perhaps MP Kumarasinghe\u2019s sympathy stems from the fact that they are both from the same profession. Minister Aluthgamage is keen to prove that his battles with Ramanayaka are over. This level of immature reasoning distracts the actual damage caused by Ramanayaka.<\/p> <p>Premadasa, too, speaks of Ramanayake as a comrade. He is yet to condemn Ramanayake\u2019s attempts to corrupt our law enforcement officers for political gain. Premadasa never visited any of the officers or men or their families during their incarceration visited Ramanayake in prison.<\/p> <p>Ramanayake\u2019s efforts to persecute the MI must be analysed. The investigators did not have sufficient evidence to pursue the case. As in the case of Eknaligoda, it\u2019s not clear if a crime took place. Yet, Ramanayake\u2019s dedicated task was to ensure that investigators and judges breathed life into the persecution.<\/p> <p>Killing the MI<\/p> <p>The Yahapalana Government came to power on the promise to prosecute the corrupt. The failure to do so severely discredited that Government. However, persecuting the military was not part of that promise. In fact, then President Maithripala Sirisena even claimed his Government saved the military from possible prosecution from international courts.<\/p> <p>Yet, the persecution of the military continued \u2013 even though it contributed to that Government\u2019s growing unpopularity. The public openly rallied around the Major who was order to pay Rs 2 million as compensation to the family of a terrorist, who was shot dead as he tried to escape arrest. Notwithstanding all these factors \u2013 lack of evidence and public disenchantment \u2013 the Yahapalana Government continued to engage in its agenda.<\/p> <p>The shocking conclusion is the Yahapalana Government was never interested in delivering justice to the victims, alleged or real. They just gave the excuse to hound the MI. Exposing the identity of an MI officer is the best way to end their career. One who works for the MI or any other intelligence unit does not operate in uniform but in anonymity. They must blend with the environment as needed. Until the very public arrests of these officers and men, even their own families did not know their role or responsibility.<\/p> <p>As their identity got exposed, their active networks and ongoing operations were compromised. The roles they play in these operations are built over a long period of time. Thus, it is not possible for one to be replaced with another. Even former officers and men became targets because their actions played a direct role in the LTTE\u2019s downfall. The turning point of the war was when the MI became an active component. The intelligence they gathered and their unique strategies hampered the LTTE.<\/p> <p>As such, the LTTE international network is bitterly angry with the MI. The anger of this network is useful to the West\u2019s and India\u2019s geopolitics that sees use in keeping Sri Lanka destabilised. Keeping the country\u2019s national security weak and dumbing down its intelligence is important for this side of geopolitics. Having come to power on the shoulders of these wicked elements, the Yahapalana Government was beholden to discredit the military and weaken its intelligence.<\/p> <p>The Yahapalana Government was not an unwilling participant. The UNP opposed the war against terrorism, even to the extent of informing every international lending agency that they will not honour the loans given to fund the war. Hence, when terrorism was defeated they too were politically massacred. Their only way out is to discredit the war itself and criminalise those who rendered a great service to the country. Therefore, persecuting the MI and other efforts to imprison Military leaders was very satisfying to these discredited politicians. This was a bonus to the agenda set by their handlers.<\/p> <p>Power over Patriotism<\/p> <p>Premadasa is a victim of the LTTE. His father was assassinated by the LTTE, despite the support he gave them. He, more than any other, should be grateful to the military for ending that era of killing and destruction.<\/p> <p>Yet, even when he met the UK Minister of State Foreign Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, he failed to set the record straight on the alleged war crimes. Lord Ahmad is one of the main British politicians leading the persecution against the Sri Lankan military. He categorically had refused to take into account the records compiled by the British Home Office by the then British Defence Attach\u00e9 Lt Col Anthony Gash simply because it does not fit the narrative against<\/p> <p>Sri Lanka.<\/p> <p>It is truly a sad state of affairs that the regime changes have an heir to carry their mantle \u2013 even after the resolute defeat of the Yahapalana Government.<\/p> <p>ranasingheshivanthi@gmail.com<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3LN50BUKPXQCG1GDOUOUYCIBVSAPLA"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":616,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping","other"],"year":"2008","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"editor, nation newspaper, abduction, 2008","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping","other"],"year":"2008","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"editor, nation newspaper, abduction, 2008","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":959732778,"Input.title":"Who will compensate and protect workers in Leicester\u2019s garment industry?","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-14 16:39:04","Input.article_interface":"<p>THIS year has been exceptionally difficult for us all. My city of Leicester has had it particularly tough for two key reasons.<\/p> <p>We have faced coronavirus restrictions for longer than any other area, which includes not been able to visit each other\u2019s home indoors since the start of the first national lockdown in March 2020 and we have also faced an overdue yet painful resurgence of attention on the scandal in our garment industry.<\/p> <p>Exploitation in Leicester\u2019s garment industry has been an \u201copen secret\u201d and widely reported and studied for at least a decade, yet successive conservative governments have failed to act.<\/p> <p>Despite the extended media focus, as the year draws to a close, the central questions remain unanswered \u2014 what progress has been made this year, and who is protecting workers in Leicester\u2019s garment industry?<\/p> <p>Tomorrow, the environmental audit committee \u2014 of which I am a member \u2014 shall be examining Leicester\u2019s garment industry as part of our follow-up inquiry on fashion sustainability.<\/p> <p>Shamefully, the government rejected most if not all the recommendations of the committee\u2019s 2019 inquiry entitled Fixing Fashion: Clothing Consumption and Sustainability, which highlighted concerns regarding fast fashion and exploitation in Leicester\u2019s garment industry.<\/p> <p>After this year\u2019s resurgence of reports and widespread condemnation into the scandal, the government must take its head out of the sand and legislate to protect vulnerable workers.<\/p> <p>The investigation will include an evidence session with Boohoo Group\u2019s executive chairman, Mahmud Kaman.<\/p> <p>The recent Levitt inquiry, commissioned by Boohoo itself, found that Boohoo was aware of endemic workers\u2019 rights abuses in Leicester\u2019s garment industry.<\/p> <p>By procuring garments from companies that routinely under-report hours, force employees to work in buildings that pose a severe fire risk and pay as little as four times lower than the legal minimum wage \u2014 BooHoo has been complicit in severe instances of exploitation.<\/p> <p>Yet it chose to ignore the plight of workers in order to seek ever-higher profits, as sales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have also helped reward BooHoo\u2019s bosses with bonuses worth \u00a3150 million.<\/p> <p>Yet despite being at the centre of this scandal, it is unclear what action BooHoo has taken to end exploitation in their supply chains.<\/p> <p>For example, it is not clear what steps Boohoo has taken to ensure that its purchasing practices don\u2019t act as a driver for illegal pay and poor conditions.<\/p> <p>Boohoo must sign the transparency pledge and make all of its supplier details public (at home and abroad).<\/p> <p>Indeed, it is appalling that Boohoo has not yet published a full list of its suppliers \u2014 despite promising to do so.<\/p> <p>This only begs the question, what is it attempting to hide?<\/p> <p>As the excellent campaign group Labour Behind the Label argue, Boohoo must also end its behaviour of terminating ties with suppliers without paying back wages.<\/p> <p>Going further than this, Boohoo should make funding immediately available to ensure that all workers who have enabled their huge profits are fully compensated for years of working at less than half the minimum wage.<\/p> <p>Beyond Boohoo, the government and regulatory institutions are not doing nearly enough to protect and recompense underpaid workers.<\/p> <p>Workers are still not being paid at least the minimum wage and remain for years on zero-hours contracts without access to holiday pay, sick pay, meal breaks or time-off pay.<\/p> <p>There are still grave concerns regarding the illegal use of furlough, double record keeping and unsafe and dangerous work environments.<\/p> <p>Research carried out by the University of Leicester in 2015 revealed that most garment workers were paid way below the national minimum wage, did not have employment contracts, and were subject to intense and arbitrary work practices.<\/p> <p>The research calculated that the average wage was approximately \u00a33 per hour and made a conservative estimate that the underpaid wage sum in apparel manufacturing within the East Midlands was around \u00a31 million per week.<\/p> <p>A more recent study by the British Retail Consortium puts the figure at nearer 2.1 million per week.<\/p> <p>The workers whose wages have been stolen from them must be recompensed.<\/p> <p>Serious questions need to be asked about the extent to which some among Leicester textile suppliers have engaged in money laundering and VAT fraud.<\/p> <p>A recent BBC investigation found that firms in Leicester which supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion had engaged in fraudulent practices, including misleading invoices and cash laundering transactions.<\/p> <p>This investigation found that \u00a38m had been received by six companies said to be issuing fake invoices to the original wholesaler, which means that as much as \u00a31.6m of VAT was not recovered.<\/p> <p>As this investigation was only the tip of the iceberg, it is possible that tens or even hundreds of millions of taxes are being avoided across the sector.<\/p> <p>One of the main reasons why these appalling instances of workplace exploitation in Leicester have been able to exist unchecked, is that 10 years of austerity has severely downgraded our regulatory institutions.<\/p> <p>The local authority in Leicester has had its central government grant funding cut from \u00a3289m in 2010 to \u00a3171m in 2019.<\/p> <p>The government has also slashed the budget of the Health and Safety Executive by \u00a3100m, or 46 per cent, since 2010.<\/p> <p>The budget of HM Revenue and Customs, the body which is meant to enforce the minimum wage, was 40 per cent less in 2016 than in 2000, and staffing levels were reduced by approximately 50 per cent over the same period.<\/p> <p>In 2020, HMRC\u2019s national minimum wage team remains significantly under-resourced, meaning the risk of inspection is low.<\/p> <p>The most recent director of labour market strategy states that \u201cthe average employer can expect an inspection around once every 500 years.\u201d<\/p> <p>There are also grave concerns regarding the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), which is dubbed by the government as the leading investigative agency for labour exploitation in Britain.<\/p> <p>For one thing, between July and August 2020 \u2014 the peak of coverage of this crisis \u2014 GLAA did not carry out any enforcement action against employers.<\/p> <p>Yet equally worrying is the fact that investigations carried out previously by GLAA involved joint work with immigration enforcement.<\/p> <p>For instance, in 2011, Operation Serbal was launched by the UK Border Agency and so called \u201cillegal workers\u201d were arrested in a series of raids on Leicester clothing factories, between May and July 2011.<\/p> <p>Indeed, this summer saw a noticeable increase in immigration enforcement vans following the recent resurgence in media reports on this scandal.<\/p> <p>This is as counterproductive as it is callous. As the Trades Union Congress rightly highlights, there is clear evidence that workers are deterred from making complaints as they fear being wrongly referred to immigration enforcement.<\/p> <p>Joint working should cease and a firewall between immigration enforcement and employment rights enforcement agencies should be established.<\/p> <p>There must be a switch in focus from immigration status to tackling worker exploitation.<\/p> <p>Rights are meaningless if they are not properly enforced. The government must urgently reverse the funding cuts to regulatory bodies to ensure the safety and fair pay of those at work.<\/p> <p>The government could also enhance current regulations by introducing a textile adjudicator (similar to the Groceries Code Adjudicator), which could ensure that payment terms to suppliers are fair, including offering recourse to solution on late order cancellations, delays in payments, unfair or illegal deductions, all of which have a knock-on effect on employment at supplier factories and the ability of suppliers to pay legal wages and provide secure employment.<\/p> <p>Trade unions are the best line of defence against workplace exploitation, and the government must open the door for their involvement.<\/p> <p>Unions must be granted access to Leicester workplaces to inform workers about the benefits of union membership and collective bargaining.<\/p> <p>It also must be made easier for working people to negotiate collectively with their employer, including simplifying the process that workers must follow to have their union recognised by their employer for collective bargaining.<\/p> <p>The scope of collective bargaining rights must also be widened, and trade unions should be actively involved in labour market inspections.<\/p> <p>Perhaps a new textile and garment workers union is long overdue to help restore Leicester\u2019s once proud role as the jewel in the crown of British industry.<\/p> <p>Overall, the lack of progress, made this year, in tackling exploitation in Leicester\u2019s garment industry, mirrors that of the last decade \u2014 which is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p>Private companies like Boohoo, regulatory bodies and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 the government must start approaching this crisis with the ambition and urgency it demands.<\/p> <p>Claudia Webbe MP is the Member of Parliament for Leicester East.

He attended \u2013 and his closest officials appear to have organised \u2013 several gatherings at his residence in Downing Street in 2020 and 2021 at a time when the rest of the country was under strict lockdown. For the first time the public mood has shifted against Johnson.<\/p> <p>And it is also not as though there are not lots of other, more critically important things relating to Johnson to be far more enraged about, even before we consider his catastrophic handling of the pandemic, and his raiding of the public coffers to enrich his crony friends and party donors.<\/p> <p>He is also a well-documented liar. Few, least of all in the media, cared much about his pattern of lying until now. Indeed, most observers have long pointed out that his popularity was based on his mischief-making and his populist guise as an anti-establishment politician. No one, apart from his political opponents, seemed too bothered.<\/p> <p>The sudden chorus of outrage at Johnson impugning Starmer\u2019s reputation is strange in many different ways. It is not as though Johnson has a record of good behaviour. His whole political persona is built on the idea of his being a rascal, a clown, a chancer.<\/p> <p>Johnson accused Starmer, who at the time was Director of Public Prosecutions, of wasting \u201chis time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile\u201d.<\/p> <p>The reason? Last week the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, blamed Starmer, now the Labour party leader, for failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile, a TV presenter and serial child abuser, when his case came under police review in 2009. Between 2008 and 2013, Starmer was head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Savile died in 2011 before he could face justice.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhy is Boris Johnson making false claims about Starmer and Savile?\u201d runs a headline in the news pages of the Guardian. It is just one of a barrage of indignant recent stories in the British media, rushing to the defence of the opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer.<\/p> <p>My latest: The media's watchdog role is an illusion. The current scandal over Boris Johnson's lockdown parties reveals just how dependent journalists are on government https:\/\/t.co\/BxykcG3qfc<\/p> <p>But it was Johnson\u2019s criticisms of Starmer, not partygate, that led several of his senior advisers last week to resign their posts. One can at least suspect that in their case \u2013 given how quickly the Johnson brand is sinking, and the repercussions they may face from a police investigation into the partygate scandal \u2013 that finding an honorable pretext for jumping ship may have been the wisest move.<\/p> <p>But there is something deeply strange about Johnson\u2019s own Conservative MPs and the British media lining up to express their indignation at Johnson\u2019s attack on Starmer, a not particularly liked or likable opposition leader, and then turning it into the reason to bring down a prime minister whose other flaws are only too visible.<\/p> <p>What makes the situation even weirder is that Johnson\u2019s so-called \u201csmears\u201d of Starmer may not actually be smears at all. They look like rare examples of Johnson alluding to \u2013 admittedly in his own clumsy and self-interested way \u2013 genuinely problematic behaviour by Starmer.<\/p> <p>One would never know this from the coverage, of course.<\/p> <p>Here is the Guardian supposedly fact-checking Johnson\u2019s attack on Starmer under the apparently neutral question: \u201cIs there any evidence that Starmer was involved in any decision not to prosecute Savile?\u201d<\/p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s answer is decisive:<\/p> <p>No. The CPS has confirmed that there is no reference to any involvement from Starmer in the decision-making within an official report examining the case. Surrey police consulted the CPS for advice about the allegations after interviewing Savile\u2019s victims, according to a 2013 CPS statement made by Starmer as DPP. The official report, written by Alison Levitt QC, found that in October 2009 the CPS lawyer responsible for the cases \u2013 who was not Starmer \u2013 advised that no prosecution could be brought on the grounds that none of the complainants were \u2018prepared to support any police action\u2019.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s a pretty definite \u201cNo\u201d, then. Not \u201cNo, according to Starmer\u201d. Or \u201cNo, according to the CPS\u201d. Or \u201cNo, according to an official report\u201d \u2013 and doubtless a determinedly face-saving one at that \u2013 into the Savile scandal.<\/p> <p>Just \u201cNo\u201d.<\/p> <p>Here is the Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker echoing how cut and dried the corporate media\u2019s assessment is: \u201c[Starmer] had no connection to decisions over the case, and the idea he did emerged later in conspiracy theories mainly shared among the far right.\u201d<\/p> <p>So it\u2019s just a far-right conspiracy theory. Case against Starmer closed.<\/p> <p>But not so fast.<\/p> <p>Given Savile\u2019s tight ties to the establishment \u2013 from royalty and prime ministers down \u2013 and the establishment\u2019s role in providing, however inadvertently, cover for Savile\u2019s paedophilia for decades, it should hardly surprise us that the blame for the failure to prosecute him has been placed squarely on the shoulders of a low-level lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service. How it could be otherwise? If we started unpicking the thorny Savile knot, who knows how the threads might unravel?<\/p> <p>Sacrificial victim<\/p> <p>Former ambassador Craig Murray has made an interesting observation about Johnson\u2019s remark on Starmer. Murray, let us remember, has been a first-hand observer and chronicler of the dark arts of the establishment in protecting itself from exposure, after he himself was made a sacrificial victim for revealing the British government\u2019s illegal involvement in torture and extraordinary rendition.<\/p> <p>My latest: The refusal to hear Craig Murray\u2019s appeal against his unprecedented conviction for \u2018jigsaw identification\u2019 means the British state has now effectively been given the power to license journalists https:\/\/t.co\/czxg9VNtnU \u2014 Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) July 30, 2021<\/p> <p>As Murray notes:<\/p> <p>Of course the Director of Public Prosecutions does not handle the individual cases, which are assigned to lawyers under them. But the Director most certainly is then consulted on the decisions in the high profile and important cases. That is why they are there. It is unthinkable that Starmer was not consulted on the decision to shelve the Savile case \u2013 what do they expect us to believe his role was, as head of the office, ordering the paperclips?<\/p> <p>And of the official inquiry into Starmer\u2019s role that cleared him of any wrongdoing, the one that so impresses the Guardian and everyone else, Murray adds:<\/p> <p>When the public outcry reached a peak in 2012, Starmer played the go-to trick in the Establishment book. He commissioned an \u201cindependent\u201d lawyer he knew to write a report exonerating him. Mistakes have been made at lower levels, lessons will be learnt\u2026 you know what it says. Mishcon de Reya, money launderers to the oligarchs, provided the lawyer to do the whitewash. Once he retired from the post of DPP, Starmer went to work at, umm,\u2026<\/p> <p>Yes, Mischon de Reya.<\/p> <p>Delighted to be joining Mishcon de Reya and to remain with Doughty Street Chambers under new dual capacity rules http:\/\/t.co\/ejoBDIxImK \u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) June 23, 2014<\/p> <p>Starmer and Assange<\/p> <p>Murray also notes that MPs and the British media have resolutely focused attention on Starmer\u2019s alleged non-role in the Savile decision \u2013 where an \u201cofficial report\u201d provides them with cover \u2013 rather than an additional, and far more embarrassing, point made by Johnson about Starmer\u2019s behaviour as Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p> <p>The prime minister mentioned Starmer using his time to \u201cprosecute journalists\u201d. Johnson and the media have no interest in clarifying that reference. Anyway, Johnson only made it for effect: as a contrast to the way Starmer treated Savile, as a way to highlight that, when he chose to, Starmer was quite capable of advancing a prosecution.<\/p> <p>But this second point is potentially far more revealing both of Starmer\u2019s misconduct as Director of Public Prosecutions and about the services he rendered to the establishment \u2013 the likely reason why he was knighted at a relatively young age, becoming \u201cSir\u201d Keir.<\/p> <p>The journalist referenced by Johnson was presumably Julian Assange, currently locked up in Belmarsh high-security prison in London as lawyers try to get him extradited to the United States for his exposure of US war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.<\/p> <p>At an early stage of Assange\u2019s persecution, the Crown Prosecution Service under Starmer worked overtime \u2013 despite Britain\u2019s official position of neutrality in the case \u2013 to ensure he was extradited to Sweden. Assange sought political asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012, when Starmer was still head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Assange did so because he got wind of efforts by the Americans to extradite him onwards from Sweden to the US. He feared the UK would collude in that process.<\/p> <p>Assange, it turns out, was not wrong. With the Swedish investigation dropped long ago, the British courts are now, nearly a decade on, close to agreeing to the Biden administration\u2019s demand that Assange be extradited to the US \u2013 both to silence him and to intimidate any other journalists who might try to throw a light on US war crimes.<\/p> <p>My latest: It is the ultimate, ugly paradox that Julian Assange\u2019s legal and physical fate rests in the hands of two states \u2013 the US and UK \u2013 that have the most to lose by allowing him to regain his freedom and publish more of the truths they want concealed https:\/\/t.co\/M7WTKq0ZXf \u2014 Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) December 17, 2021<\/p> <p>The Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi has been pursuing a lengthy legal battle to have the CPS emails from Starmer\u2019s time released under a Freedom of Information request. She has been opposed by the British establishment every step of the way. We know that many of the email chains relating to Assange were destroyed by the Crown Prosecution Service \u2013 apparently illegally. Those would doubtless have shone a much clearer light on Starmer\u2019s role in the case \u2013 possibly the reason they were destroyed.<\/p> <p>The small number of emails that have been retrieved show that the Crown Prosecution Service under Starmer micro-managed the Swedish investigation of Assange, even bullying Swedish prosecutors to pursue the case when they had started to lose interest for lack of evidence. In one email from 2012, a CPS lawyer warned his Swedish counterpart: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare get cold feet!!!\u201d. In another from 2011, the CPS lawyer writes: \u201cPlease do not think this case is being dealt with as just another extradition.\u201d<\/p> <p>Prosecutors arm-twisted<\/p> <p>Again, the idea that Starmer was not intimately involved in the decision to arm-twist Swedish prosecutors into persecuting a journalist \u2013 a case that the UK should formally have had no direct interest in, unless it was covertly advancing US interests to silence Assange \u2013 beggars belief.<\/p> <p>Despite the media\u2019s lack of interest in Assange\u2019s plight, the energy expended by the US to get Assange behind bars in the US and redefine national security journalism as espionage shows how politically and diplomatically important this case has always been to the US \u2013 and by extension, the British establishment. There is absolutely no way the deliberations were handled by a single lawyer. Starmer would have closely overseen his staff\u2019s dealings with Swedish prosecutors and authorised what was in practice a political decision, not legal one, to persecute Assange \u2013 or as United Nations experts defined it, \u201carbitrarily detain\u201d him.<\/p> <p>My latest: Lies about UN body threaten not just Julian Assange https:\/\/t.co\/AKiTmP8VL5 #Assange #unwgad \u2014 Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) February 5, 2016<\/p> <p>Neither Murray nor I have unique, Sherlock-type powers of deduction that allow us to join the dots in ways no one else can manage. All of this information is in the public realm, and all of it is known to the editors of the British media. They are not only choosing to avoid mentioning it in the context of the current row, but they are actively fulminating against Boris Johnson for having done so.<\/p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s crime isn\u2019t that he has \u201csmeared\u201d Starmer. It is that \u2013 out of desperate self-preservation \u2013 he has exposed the dark underbelly of the establishment. He has broken the elite\u2019s omerta, its vow of silence. He has made the unpardonable sin of grassing up the establishment to which he belongs. He has potentially given ammunition to the great unwashed to expose the establishment\u2019s misdeeds, to blow apart its cover story. That is why the anger is far more palpable and decisive about Johnson smearing Starmer than it ever was when Johnson smeared the rest of us by partying on through the lockdowns.<\/p> <p>Scorched-earth tactic?<\/p> <p>Look at this headline on Jonathan Freedland\u2019s latest column for the Guardian, visibly aquiver with anger at the way Johnson has defamed Starmer: \u201cJohnson\u2019s Savile smear was the scorched-earth tactic of a desperate, dangerous man\u201d.<\/p> <p>A prime minister attacking the opposition leader \u2013 something we would normally think of as a largely unexceptional turn of political events, and all the more so under Johnson \u2013 has been transformed by Freedland into a dangerous, scorched-earth tactic.<\/p> <p>Quite how preposterous, and hypocritical, this claim is should not need underscoring. Who really needs to be reminded of how Freedland and the rest of media class \u2013 but especially Freedland \u2013 treated Stramer\u2019s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn? That really was a scorched-earth approach. There was barely a day in his five years leading the Labour party when the media did not fabricate the most outrageous lies about Corbyn and his party. He was shabby and unstatesmanlike (unlike the smartly attired Johnson!), sexist, a traitor, a threat to national security, an anti-semite, and much more.<\/p> <p>Anyone like Freedland who actively participated in the five-year campaign of demonisation of Corbyn has no credibility whatsoever either complaining about the supposed mistreatment of Starmer (a pale shadow of what Corbyn suffered) or decrying Johnson\u2019s lowering of standards in public life.<\/p> <p>We have the right-wing populist Johnson in power precisely because Freedland and the rest of the media relentlessly smeared the democratic socialist alternative. In the 2017 election, let us recall, Corbyn was only 2,000 votes from winning. The concerted campaign of smears from across the entire corporate media \u2013 and the resulting manipulation of the public mood \u2013 was the difference between Corbyn winning and the Tories holding on to power.<\/p> <p>Corbyn was destroyed \u2013 had to be destroyed \u2013 because he threatened establishment interests. He challenged the interests of the rich, of the corporations, of the war industries, of the Israel lobby. That was why an anonymous military general warned in the pages of the establishment\u2019s newspaper, The Times, that there would be a mutiny if Corbyn ever reached 10 Downing Street. That was why soldiers were filmed using an image of Corbyn as target practice on a firing range in Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>Johnson\u2019s desperate \u201csmears\u201d aside, none of this will ever happen to Starmer. There will be no threats of mutiny and his image will never used for target practice by the army. Sir Keir won\u2019t be defamed by the billionaire-owned media. Rather, they have demonstrated that they have his back. They will even promote him over an alumnus of the Bullingdon Club, when the blokey toff\u2019s shine starts to wear off.<\/p> <p>And that, it should hardly need pointing out, is because Sir Keir Starmer is there to protect not the public\u2019s interests but the interests of the establishment, just as he did so conscientiously when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3AQN9REUTHVNR3KM20MPSQ3IQPPYDD"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"eb84bfc7-99bf-4727-a72b-f85f9eb5626e","work_time_in_seconds":2702,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"Belmarsh high-security prison, London, US war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"Belmarsh high-security prison, London, US war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1004152973,"Input.title":"Bloody Sunday victims remembered as PH activists push for workers\u2019 rights, welfare","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-15 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By KENT GALIDO<\/p> <p>Bulatlat.com<\/p> <p>MANILA \u2013 Southern Tagalog activist Kobi Tolentino can still vividly remember his memories of Emmanuel Asuncion who was fondly called as \u201cKa Manny\u201d and the day their office was raided.<\/p> <p>Asuncion was the secretary general of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan \u2013 Cavite when he was killed in a police raid in the Southern Tagalog region on March 7, 2021, now known as the Bloody Sunday.

Burak could see there were five holes for screws, but he was only allowed to put three in.<\/p> <p>When roofers asked \u2018why don\u2019t we put the full amount in?\u2019 bosses would reply, \u2018don\u2019t complain.\u2019<\/p> <p>Burak\u2019s silence was required when the project\u2019s top management or a government inspector came to visit.<\/p> <p>The roof was built using a German engineering system, and foreign engineers would be there for the final quality control. But by the time they came to inspect the roof, you couldn\u2019t tell there were too few screws holding it together.<\/p> <p>File9 1<\/p> <p>\u2018We are not slaves\u2019<\/p> <p>Finally, workers across the site downed tools in September last year because they could no longer stand the filthy living conditions, the disgusting food, the long hours and the sheer risks they were being forced to take.<\/p> <p>By this point, the pressure on iGA to complete the job had been ratcheted up further because of President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s desire to see the airport open in time for Turkish Republic Day at the end of October.<\/p> <p>iGA had already tried and failed to have it open in February 2018 in time for the president\u2019s birthday.<\/p> <p>Yet now it was witnessing thousands chanting \u2018Kole Degiliz\u2019 (\u2018we are not slaves\u2019) while occupying the area where the workers\u2019 shuttle buses departed.<\/p> <p>The police and local gendarmarie were quick on the scene, as too were a handful of Turkish television journalists from broadcaster Arta TV. They captured images of the authorities using water and tear gas to violently disburse the crowds. While 401 workers were arrested and detained because of the walkout, the protests were successful in communicating the plight of the workers to a wider audience including human rights groups and international media outlets such as Reuters.<\/p> <p>Architectural promotion<\/p> <p>In terms of what was known and when, the Turkish media reported that by February 2018 there had been 27 fatalities on the project. The international press picked up on this during the protests that September, and in January this year, Turkish authorities confirmed the number of deaths had risen to 55.<\/p> <p>Yet despite the project\u2019s mass protests and heavy death toll, the British and European architectural practices that designed Istanbul Airport have continued to promote the project in recent months.<\/p> <p>As protesters against the death toll sat in jail, Scott Brownrigg invited British journalists to tour the facility and construction site.<\/p> <p>The six-runway development has a prominent place on the websites of delivery architect Scott Brownrigg and concept architects Grimshaw, Haptic Architects and Nordic Office of Architecture. The practices have entered the scheme for awards, exhibited their design at trade shows and posted about it on social media.<\/p> <p>In October last year, as site protesters sat in jail, Scott Brownrigg \u2013 which acted as lead designer for the new terminal building from March 2015 to October 2017 (initially as GMW) \u2013 invited British journalists to tour the facility and construction site.<\/p> <p>The invitation was sent to coincide with the airport\u2019s partial opening that month on behalf of iGA and boasted that the \u2018incredible\u2019 scheme had been completed \u2018after only 42 months of construction\u2019. Both the AJ and Construction News declined the invitation.<\/p> <p>File4<\/p> <p>Scott Brownrigg says that during its time on site it was \u2018not made aware of any fatalities, poor working conditions or the site safety issues\u2019. On its website, the practice says that it always \u2018considers the social, environmental and economic context\u2019 in which it works and understands that its operations \u2018have impacts at a local, regional and global level\u2019. Additionally, the firm has signed up to the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact which includes sections on protecting human rights and labour rights.<\/p> <p>The practice\u2019s director of aviation, Maurice Rosario, defends its work on the airport but declines to explain how this aligns with its ethical policies other than to say that Scott Brownrigg cannot \u2018control the policies and procedures of our clients\u2019.<\/p> <p>He says: \u2018We developed the design and reviewed mock-ups but were not required to review any on-site work during the construction process.<\/p> <p>\u2018Access to the site was limited and tightly controlled by the EPC contractor,\u2019 he adds. \u2018During this time, we were not made aware of any fatalities.\u2019<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, construction is inherently risky. Deaths and injuries can also happen on UK sites Maurice Rosario, Scott Brownrigg<\/p> <p>Rosario says that Scott Brownrigg was not \u2018contractually responsible\u2019 for on-site delivery and construction, and was \u2018shocked and saddened\u2019 to hear news of the deaths.<\/p> <p>\u2018The safety of all who work on projects we are involved in is of paramount importance,\u2019 he says. \u2018Unfortunately, construction is inherently risky. Deaths and injuries can also happen on UK sites despite extensive work to mitigate them \u2026 it is only by being involved internationally that we can try to make the situation better and provide a catalyst for changing and improving global design standards.\u2019<\/p> <p>Asked about the practice\u2019s recent promotion of the airport, Rosario says the design has won several awards including a World Architecture Festival (WAF) prize and that it is \u2018widely acknowledged to be of architectural interest to journalists and those within the sector\u2019.<\/p> <p>Concept architects Grimshaw, Haptic Architects and Nordic Office of Architecture all ceased working on the project in late 2014 or early 2015, prior to the construction phase, and have voiced shock and sadness about what Grimshaw has described as the scheme\u2019s \u2018alarmingly high number\u2019 of subsequent deaths.<\/p> <p>A spokesperson for Grimshaw says its concept design enabled \u2018straightforward and safe construction\u2019, adding that, \u2018while we are generally always keen to see our projects through to completion\u2019, it decided against bidding for the delivery role \u2018after careful consideration of the very swift programme and associated design and construction challenges.\u2019<\/p> <p>The spokesperson adds: \u2018Istanbul Airport is a very large and complex project and it was clear to us from the outset that our designs should be clear, simple, modular and must prioritise ease of construction.<\/p> <p>\u2018This would allow the contractor to build safely and with reliable quality, even in circumstances where our involvement in the project wouldn\u2019t continue through the later stages of design.<\/p> <p>\u2018As a practice, we place the highest importance on the safety of all who work with us, either directly or indirectly, and we endeavour to work with clients and contractors who maintain the highest possible safety standards for all those involved at every stage of a project.\u2019<\/p> <p>For its part, Nordic, which is based in Oslo, says it is \u2018very proud to have designed this fantastic building\u2019 but also \u2018deeply saddened\u2019 by the scheme\u2019s health and safety record.<\/p> <p>Founding partner Gudmund Stokke says he visited the construction site but did not see evidence that it was \u2018different to any other building site\u2019.<\/p> <p>He adds: \u2018I\u2019m aware of what I\u2019ve read in the newspapers. It is very sad. This experience makes me think in relation to future projects: can we as architects do more to safeguard good working conditions on our building sites?<\/p> <p>\u2018It strikes me that policies for this could be a challenge for the Architects Council of Europe.\u2019<\/p> <p>In a statement from London-based Haptic Architects, the firm says it is \u2018very saddened\u2019 by the large number of people who died building Istanbul Airport, adding \u2018as far as we are concerned any death on site is one too many, as we hold the safety of our teams and co-workers to be of the highest importance.\u2019<\/p> <p>Commenting on the situation, architecture and human rights expert Eyal Weizman, the founder of Forensic Architecture, says he finds it disturbing that contemporary architecture around the world often has what he calls a \u2018pharaonic dimension\u2019.<\/p> <p>He adds: \u2018These projects are made mainly for the affluent sections of society and are built by a poorer migrant workforce under gruelling conditions and schedules.<\/p> <p>\u2018A building like this should be a monument or a memorial. It should be dedicated to the casualties that its architecture and its delivery demanded.\u2019<\/p> <p>\u2018Soul searching\u2019<\/p> <p>What do the workers who endured life in \u2018the cemetery\u2019 \u2013 as the project was nicknamed \u2013 think of the involvement of the international architects?<\/p> <p>For some, it is difficult to see how rolled-out blueprints composed in an airy London studio can relate to a man dying alone in the dirt on a building site near the Black Sea. But for others, the connection is all too clear.<\/p> <p>\u2018English architects need to do some soul-searching,\u2019 says Burak, the roofer.<\/p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s us that put our blood, sweat and tears into building it. Officially, on record, we have 55 friends that died. Their blood has been shed building the airport.<\/p> <p>If the architects are so proud of being part of building the airport, they should be willing to give their lives like the 55 people did<\/p> <p>\u2018Wherever you are in the world, you need to consider the relationship between money and labour. They should think about the workers and support them.\u2019<\/p> <p>In a complex international project, stakeholders naturally tend to be selective about their involvement when things go wrong. But can you boast about your involvement in the world\u2019s biggest airport while simultaneously disassociating yourself from the workers that lost their lives?<\/p> <p>For Burak, whose labour helped bring the architects\u2019 visions to life, this pride should recognise the costs borne by those who built it.<\/p> <p>\u2018If the architects are so proud of being part of building the airport, they should be willing to give their lives like the 55 people did,\u2019 he says.<\/p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not saying the architects or engineers need to die, but none of them did. It shouldn\u2019t be the fate of those building the airport either.\u2019<\/p> <p>Construction News and the Architects\u2019 Journal contacted iGA, detailing the allegations laid out in this article. A public relations company acting on behalf of the joint venture responded with the following message: \u2018iGA will not answer the request you sent.\u2019<\/p> <p>The politics behind the world\u2019s biggest airport As the land on the edge of the Black Sea was transformed from ancient forests to the world\u2019s biggest airport, the rest of Turkey was rapidly changing too. Two years after construction began, the infamous 15 July 2016 G\u00fclen coup d\u2019\u00e9tat took place. Even beforehand President Erdo\u011fan (pictured) and his ruling AKP party were being described by The Economist as establishing a \u2018new sultanate\u2019 that ruled with an \u2018iron grip\u2019. But following the failed coup, Erdo\u011fan further cemented his grip on power. A two-year state of emergency, which came to an end after the election in June 2018, has seen more than 107,000 people removed from public-sector jobs and more than 50,000 people imprisoned pending trial, according to official statistics and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Turkey also became the world\u2019s leader in jailing journalists during this period, topping the Committee to Protect Journalists global list for a third straight year in 2018. Perceived insults of the president on social media platforms such as Twitter, which are also intermittently blocked by the government, can also land you in jail. And Erdo\u011fan\u2019s strongman status has always relied on delivering megaprojects. Multi-billion transport investments, which include a new bridge across the Bosporus, are described by the Turkish leader as his self-proclaimed \u2018crazy projects\u2019. The airport is the latest and most ambitious to date and its successful completion is of great importance to Turkey\u2019s most powerful man.<\/p> <p>Top image: Associated Press<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"35XW21VSVIT9TTW5GBSOTHNMIDVLS2"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":620,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","unknown","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Istanbul","region":"None","country":"Turkey","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"construction workers, safety, deaths, poverty, laborers, Turkey, Istanbul Airport,","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","unknown","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Istanbul","region":"None","country":"Turkey","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"construction workers, safety, deaths, poverty, laborers, Turkey, Istanbul Airport,","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":959400868,"Input.title":"My narrative is the same as Quaid-i-Azam's, says Nawaz at PDM's Lahore power show","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-13 14:58:22","Input.article_interface":"<p>Leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Sunday blasted the government and establishment at Lahore's Minar-i-Pakistan at the sixth power show which the alliance has termed as a \"historic and decisive\" one.<\/p> <p>PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif also addressed the crowd via video link and asked who was answerable for the government's failings.<\/p> <p>\"He (PM Imran) says I won't give an NRO.

Pointing in the direction of the Home Office, Pilger told the crowd: \u201cThe behaviour of the British government towards Julian Assange is a disgrace. A profanity on the very notion of human rights. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the treatment and persecution of Julian Assange is the way that dictatorships treat a political prisoner.\u201d<\/p> <p>Pilger said he had spoken with Assange over the weekend: \u201cWhen I asked Julian what he would like me to say today, he was adamant. \u2018Say it\u2019s not just me. It\u2019s much wider. It\u2019s all of us.

The whole thing is a sham. The US prosecutors know it\u2019s a sham, the British government know it\u2019s a sham, the Australian government know it\u2019s a sham.<\/p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Julian is locked up for 21 hours a day in a maximum-security prison and treated worse than a murderer. He is to be made an example of. What happens to Julian Assange and to Chelsea Manning is meant to intimidate us, to frighten us into silence.<\/p> <p>\u201cBy defending Julian Assange, we defend our most sacred rights. Speak up now or wake up one morning to the silence of a new kind of tyranny. The choice is ours.\u201d<\/p> <p>Julian\u2019s brother Gabriel Shipton was warmly received as he spoke from the stage.

I struggled to explain in a way a five-year-old could understand. As Julian\u2019s brother, and on behalf of his children, other brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, mother and father, I call on the UK home secretary to block extradition to the USA.\u201d<\/p> <p>Waters took to the stage just after 6.30 p.m. He told the sea of supporters: \u201cTo see all you people here today is deeply, deeply moving. How do we put ourselves in the position of a Julian Assange in solitary confinement? Or with that kid in Syria, or Palestine or a Rohingya being blown to bits by these people in this building here [pointing to the Home Office]?\u201d<\/p> <p>Waters introduced \u201cWish You Were Here,\u201d the title track from Pink Floyd\u2019s 1975 chart-topping album, explaining the meaning of the song\u2019s lyrics, \u201cwould you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?\u201d He replied, \u201cWell, no, I wouldn\u2019t. This is my walk-on part in this war [pointing at the Home Office], and I would much prefer to be here with all of you, who are also making a walk-on part in the war rather than than accepting a lead role in the cage.\u201d<\/p> <p>The audience standing in the road that was closed to traffic opposite the Home Office as its size grew<\/p> <p>As Waters sang, the audience joined in, the lyrics taken up as a statement of political solidarity with Julian Assange.<\/p> <p>Concluding the event, Waters thanked the audience and called out, \u201cJulian Assange we are with you!

Free Julian Assange!\u201d<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks editor Kristinn Hrafnsson spoke to the WSWS after the event: \u201cI was heartened by how many people showed up. When you\u2019re trying to take part in the campaign to free Julian it\u2019s so important to meet the people who actually do support him. My feeling is that despite the hostility of the mainstream media, the support is growing. We have a fight ahead of us and Julian knows that, but for him to get this message is so important. It gives me hope and optimism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hrafnsson saw Assange 10 days ago and spoke over the phone with him for the first time the night before: \u201cIt took all this time to clear my number with the prison authorities. He\u2019s not in a good place and he\u2019s definitely not in a place where he should be\u2014and this has to change.\u201d<\/p> <p>He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on the mainstream media, we can\u2019t rely on politicians, we certainly can\u2019t rely on the judiciary here. People really have to understand how important this is.\u201d<\/p> <p>John Pilger<\/p> <p>John Pilger told the WSWS shortly before the rally that the concert was Waters\u2019 idea: \u201cRoger emailed me and said he\u2019d like to play \u2018Wish You Were Here\u2019 for Julian outside Belmarsh prison. But we had a look and it\u2019s just not possible. The closest you can get is the motorway, so we decided the next best thing was the Home Office.\u201d<\/p> <p>Pilger warned that Assange\u2019s condition was a matter of grave concern. \u201cI worry a great deal about him if he spends many months in Belmarsh,\u201d he said. \u201cThe regime there is imposing a kind of isolation on him that is deeply psychologically wounding. He\u2019s in a small cell in the hospital ward. They seem not to know what to do with him. Of course, what they should be doing is letting him out. He certainly should not be in a maximum-security prison.\u201d<\/p> <p>Emmy Butlin from the Julian Assange Defence Committee (JADC) also spoke with the WSWS.<\/p> <p>\u201cJohn Pilger and Roger Waters stirred our emotions tonight with their amazing words and song of solidarity with Julian Assange,\u201d Butlin said. \u201cThey spoke of empathy, of peace, against war and its profiteers whose interests WikiLeaks has challenged. We are very grateful for the wonderful turnout, a testament of the support we always find in the streets of Britain and we continue our solidarity work on Saturday the 28th of September at 2:00 p.m. outside Belmarsh Prison.<\/p> <p>\u201cAs the JADC, we are very grateful for the work the SEP is doing globally for the Free Assange campaign and for the constant participation and assistance they offer to our events.

The inquiry has been precipitated by Burundi\u2019s withdrawal from the Rome Statute, and subsequently the International Criminal Court in 2017. In addition, the inquiry was exacerbated by the constitutional referendum which made Nkurunziza\u2019s government eligible to extending their rule until 2034.<\/p> <p>In March, the United Nations Human Rights Office in the city of Bujumbura was shut down. In the shadow of the looming 2020 elections, the political situation in Burundi is presenting itself dire. An environment of fear and suspicion is especially felt by those who share any form of discontent with the incumbent national leadership. In addition, media outlets, as well as human rights organizations have been extremely restricted. The media crackdown is evident as a multitude of media outlets such as BBC have had their licences recently withdrawn as well as the recent arrest of four Burundian journalists under the grounds of undermining state security. The United Nations General Assembly report warned: \u201cArbitrary arrest and detention on political grounds have continued\u201d suggesting a culture of impunity leaving little space for democratic freedoms leading up to the 2020 election. Violent attacks on civilians and lack of human rights oversight in the country has largely inhibited capacities to observe and report. The lack of due process parallels that of 2015 in which there was an attempted military coup on the incumbent CNDD\u2013FDD. Amnesty International described the coup, \u201cBurundian police used excessive lethal force, including against women and children, to silence those opposed to President Pierre Nkurunziza\u2019s bid for a third term.\u201d The remnants of the 2015 conflict are very much alive as the ruling party\u2019s youth league, the Imbonerakure have facilitated a continuation of violent practices of 2015.

The government\u2019s disregard of International Humanitarian Law leaves little room for the international community to navigate the complex humanitarian situation. Despite this, the reopening of the UN Human Rights Office in Bujumbura should be a central objective.

In September 2018, 32 MEPs sent a letter calling for concrete human rights improvements in Vietnam before any parliament vote on the deals.<\/p> <p>Concerns were raised again in October 2018 during a hearing with Vietnamese authorities, and reiterated a month later in an urgent resolution.<\/p> <p>Regrettably, the government's crackdown has continued, with the adoption of a problematic cybersecurity law last January and new waves of arrests of perceived critics.<\/p> <p>Vietnam also rejected the EU member states' recommendations during its latest scrutiny at the UN to amend or repeal abusive legislation and to release political prisoners.<\/p> <p>In June, a group of MEPs sent a letter asking again for concrete human rights improvements to serve as benchmarks for the parliament's upcoming consent procedure.<\/p> <p>The parliament's foreign affairs committee expressed the same position a few months later in a non-binding opinion, mirroring a recent call by international and Vietnamese groups, including Human Rights Watch.<\/p> <p>Notably, Pham Chi Dung, one of the signatories of that appeal, and author of a parallel petition, was arrested on November 22, most likely for his outreach to MEPs. The arrest sparked outrage in parliament, which led to a letter by president David Sassoli raising his case.<\/p> <p>The Vietnamese ambassador's reply, seen by Human Rights Watch, plainly defends the arrest and shamelessly compares Vietnam's limitations to freedom of expression to those in place in western countries.<\/p> <p>In December, MEP Jan Zahradil, stepped down from his long-standing rapporteur role for the trade deals following allegations of institutional links with the Vietnamese Communist Party.<\/p> <p>The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) then joined the choir of voices urging the postponement of the consent until Vietnam achieves clear human rights benchmarks, concurring in the assessment that its penal code stands in the way of labour freedoms, regardless of the recent labour law reform.<\/p> <p>In an attempt to address some of these concerns, some trade committee members asked for a binding roadmap on the (long overdue) ratification of the core labour rights conventions, unconvinced by the Vietnamese government's self-imposed, non-binding and un-enforceable deadline of 2023.<\/p> <p>The committee members also timidly raised some wider human rights concerns, and called for bringing the penal legislation \"in line and in coherence with ILO (International Labour Organisation) conventions\".<\/p> <p>On January 6, prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc replied, claiming airily that \"it is a consistent policy of the government of Vietnam to protect and promote human rights,\" and failing to address the MEPs' most controversial proposals, including reform of the penal code.<\/p> <p>So where are we now?<\/p> <p>Unless there is a change in the schedule, on Tuesday (21 January) the trade committee has to adopt its final position on the deals, which would then face a final vote in plenary in early February.<\/p> <p>Trade MEPs are in a rather difficult position.<\/p> <p>A majority in the committee could grant immediate consent to the deals.

They can, assistant professor \u00adChristian Baden explains, make us distrust one another and prevent any middle ground being found between believers and non-believers.<\/p> <p>Bader, along with his colleague at the Hebrew \u00adUniversity of Jerusalem Tzlil Sharon, published a 2020 paper entitled Blinded By The Lies which looked at moving towards a unified definition of a conspiracy theory.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is not what people believe,\u201d Baden says, \u201cbut how exactly they believe it.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to their paper, it\u2019s not all about New World Orders and 9\/11 inside jobs. Anything can be a conspiracy if it ticks three boxes.<\/p> <p>The first of these is the idea of \u201cpervasive \u00adpotency\u201d. This says that the things are as they are because \u00adsomeone has willed it to be that way, and their \u00adagenda has agents everywhere.<\/p> <p>The second is the \u201cManichean binary\u201d. Everything can be ordered into true and false, good and evil. There is no space for grey shade, and no space for discussion between the two sides.<\/p> <p>And the third \u2013 Baden calls it \u201cthe famous one\u201d \u2013 is that \u201cpeople believe things because they \u00adbelieve things\u201d. What someone thinks is set in stone. \u00adEvidence is discounted if it disagrees with their prior conclusion and accepted if it matches it.<\/p> <p>While one US study found nine in 10 people rate themselves as \u201cabove average\u201d in their ability to spot such disinformation and conspiratorial thinking, it also found those more confident in their abilities were more likely to be duped.<\/p> <p>And given a chance, disinformation has legs, sometimes such fast ones that falsehoods can make it all the way to the very top.<\/p> <p>In one example, the Tory leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, repeated claims of a \u201cmissing\u201d \u00a3600,000 from SNP accounts. Despite the party clarifying that the funds were \u201caccounted for minutely\u201d, the cat had been let out of the bag.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat a massive coup to get your conspiracy \u00adtheory read out by a member of the \u00adBritish \u00adCabinet of the British \u00adParliament,\u201d \u00adMcDonald says.<\/p> <p>The SNP MP has looked in depth at the issue on an international scale, including defence strategies from Finland and \u00adSweden, and disinformation emanating from China, Iran and Russia. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who started it,\u201d he says, \u201cthe fact it has got to the despatch box, what a coup!\u201d<\/p> <p>Whether or not there is any truth to the allegations is of little consequence to Rees-Mogg. Protected by parliamentary privilege he can say anything without \u00adrepercussions, and it serves to damage his political opponents.<\/p> <p>Once it has been said in parliament, it can be reported widely \u2013 and who is to say that \u201cconcerns\u201d aren\u2019t legitimate? This was, as Jared Stacy says, all about plausibility.<\/p> <p>Stacy, an American who moved to Scotland after his community became overrun with QAnon believers, is now conducting a phd in evangelicalism and conspiracies at Aberdeen University. Such conspiracies aren\u2019t \u201cjust some national news story\u201d, for him and his community, the impacts were felt \u201cvery, very personally\u201d.<\/p> <p>Stacy says that sometimes \u00adconspiracies can spread because people legitimise the possibility of falsehoods being true. He talks of people who would \u201csignal a sympathy for conspiratorial beliefs\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople who just say \u2018we don\u2019t really know\u2019, \u2018this is probably plausible\u2019, they do create a sense of respectability to these claims. They are responsible [to an extent].\u201d<\/p> <p>And while those who entertain such \u00addisinformation may bear some responsibility, more falls on the \u00adshoulders of those who create it, using it to their own political ends. Such disinformation might take the form of attacks on \u00adminorities, on politicians, or on the judiciary.<\/p> <p>These may be open, like the Daily Mail\u2019s now infamous \u201cenemies of the people\u201d front page claiming high court judges were deliberately blocking Brexit, or they may be a more subtle undermining of the rule of law.<\/p> <p>In one example, former diplomat Craig Murray was jailed for contempt of court after a judge ruled his reporting on Alex Salmond\u2019s trial \u2013 which saw the former first minister fully acquitted \u2013 could have led to the identification of the \u00adcomplainants.<\/p> <p>Murray\u2019s case shows it is not only the Unionist side which can become transfixed on ideas of conspiracy. The blogger was jailed for contempt of court in a case within the independent legal system. Yet, rumours on social media spread that he was a political prisoner, jailed for \u00addaring to report what the Government had \u00adwanted hidden.<\/p> <p>Both cannot have been true. He \u00adcannot have reported what the law said must \u00adremain secret, and at the same time not have been in contempt of court. The \u00adelusive nature of the claims that he did manage both at once are echoed in the third aspect of Baden and Sharon\u2019s \u00addefinition of a conspiracy.<\/p> <p>Other examples of disinformation don\u2019t require the luxury of being afforded legitimacy by prominent figures or \u00adpapers. A falsehood planted in fertile ground, where the people are willing to believe anything that seems to confirm what they hold to be true, can flourish unaided.<\/p> <p>Take one social media rumour which spread like wildfire over the festive \u00adperiod. Without basis, people have claimed that the First Minister went to Portugal on holiday.<\/p> <p>Screenshots were shared of flights from Glasgow to the Algarve, people claimed the \u201cmainstream media\u201d was sitting on the story and even, incredibly, that there could be a super-injunction preventing \u00adreporting of the holiday.<\/p> <p>One news site put out a call for \u00adinformation, and when the Scottish Government denied it all, suggested that the statement\u2019s purpose had been to \u00admislead.<\/p> <p>Labour peer George Foulkes tweeted: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t object if @NicolaSturgeon has taken a few days off. But we might wonder why it is apparently so secret.\u201d<\/p> <p>George Foulkes<\/p> <p>It got to the point that when putting \u201cNicola Sturgeon\u201d into Twitter\u2019s search bar, the words \u201choliday\u201d and \u201cPortugal\u201d were the top suggestions.<\/p> <p>Elsewhere, Scottish Conservative chief whip Stephen Kerr was forced into an \u00adembarrassing climbdown after he \u00adtweeted unsourced claims which had been circling on social media that the Scottish Government had set aside \u00a3350 million for indyref2.<\/p> <p>In another example, ahead of the first Covid lockdown in March 2020, Richard Lyle, the now retired SNP MSP, raised unsubstantiated online rumours of secret army bases being built around Glasgow to put the city into lockdown with the First Minister.<\/p> <p>He asked Nicola Sturgeon about \u00ad\u201cunconfirmed reports that army units are setting up in Strathclyde park\u201d on March 19, 2020 \u2013 the same day the UK Defence Journal published its first fact check \u00adrubbishing the claims.<\/p> <p>Rumours such as these which start on social media often find fertile ground easily thanks to algorithms designed to increase engagement. \u201cLiking\u201d a post \u00adencourages platforms to show us more of the same. Ignoring one may lead to the algorithm keeping similar ones off our screens altogether.<\/p> <p>This is how echo chambers grow on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, despite having billions of diverse users across the globe. And these echo chambers can be \u00admanufactured.<\/p> <p>After Twitter banned Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 riots, the \u00addisgraced president declared he would sue them, and Facebook and Google for good measure, alleging a culture of \u00ad\u201cshadow banning\u201d and anti-Conservative bias.<\/p> <p>Donald Trump<\/p> <p>His tactics clearly mirror Baden and Sharon\u2019s three facets of conspiracy. The enemy is pervasive, having infiltrated all of the biggest of the big tech firms. It is firmly evil, positioned against \u201cAmerican freedom and at the same time, freedom of speech\u201d. And it is elusive. It ignores the fact that, as a \u201cmassive-scale\u201d study involving Twitter\u2019s own team established late last year, right-wing voices \u00adactually enjoy greater amplification on the \u00adplatform than their opponents.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, Trump is using the \u00adlanguage of conspiracy to push \u00adtowards his own ends, causing an exodus of \u00adcertain people from Twitter on to platforms such as Gettr, which was founded by his \u00adformer aide Jason Miller.<\/p> <p>Often people may find themselves pushed on to such platforms by a single issue, such as fear of \u201ccensorship\u201d, and once there find themselves exposed to ever more extreme ideologies.<\/p> <p>Other times, certain social media \u00adbubbles may have been created for the explicit purpose of radicalisation.<\/p> <p>\u201cMost people\u2019s connection to \u00adreality is mediated through our devices, our algorithmic choices, and choices that are made for us,\u201d says Stacy.<\/p> <p>In an example McDonald highlights, the biggest BLM Facebook page in the US at one point was run by the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, the \u201cTrolls from Olgino\u201d.<\/p> <p>Stewart McDonald<\/p> <p>Slowly, the page began to distribute content which had nothing to do with BLM at all, but had the aim of discrediting Trump\u2019s opponents and spreading hate.<\/p> <p>\u201cDisinformation has always been a gateway to radicalisation,\u201d McDonald says.<\/p> <p>However, Baden argues that it is not \u00adsocial media to blame. \u201cIt is a facilitation, not a cause,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat works on a global platform also works in the pub on the corner.\u201d<\/p> <p>People will always find others who share their viewpoint, \u201cit is just a lot easier to find them thanks to these \u00adalgorithms, and it is a lot easier to delude yourself that this is all there is\u201d.<\/p> <p>And when rumours spread through such communities, it can be near impossible to shut them down. This is especially true in the case of the \u201cmissing \u00a3600k\u201d, Twitter\u2019s anti-Conservative bias, or Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s holiday, because the very people who have the authority and knowledge to debunk the claims are, in the eyes of the conspiracy, in on it.<\/p> <p>Conspiracy theorists will find \u00adthemselves paraphrasing Mandy Rice-Davies\u2019s famous comment during the Profumo Affair: \u201cWell, they would say that, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d<\/p> <p>Stacy says that when trying to convince people who have bought in to disinformation it\u2019s key to take account of their \u00addignity, and give them the tools they need to come to their senses.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe stakes are really high but they\u2019re human stakes. You are talking about \u00adtaking someone\u2019s reality apart, and how do you do that?<\/p> <p>\u201cThe first thing is recognising that \u00adbasically what you\u2019re attempting to do is bring someone\u2019s world crashing down.\u201d<\/p> <p>Confidence tricksters have long \u00adrelied on someone not wanting to admit to themselves that they may have been fooled. To have the truth revealed may be a painful and embarrassing experience. A person is unlikely to be converted by a single conversation.<\/p> <p>Stacy says you must look at it as if you\u2019re \u201cputting pebbles in their shoes\u201d. Make walking the path of the conspiracy uncomfortable enough that they research sources outside of that online bubble.<\/p> <p>Talking people out of the \u201crabbit hole\u201d takes time, and, McDonald says, any \u00adeffort to fight disinformation which \u00adinvolves the government alone would be \u201cspectacularly unsuccessful\u201d.<\/p> <p>He says that there needs to be a focus on teaching young people how to spot fake news from an early age, and a programme which brings in \u201cas many parts of society as possible, different languages, different cultures, people using different media across different age groups\u201d.<\/p> <p>Such an effort would go some way to combating the first aspect of a conspiracy, the idea that the malevolent forces are pervasive. While it might seem plausible that the revolving door between government and media has led to a shared agenda, \u00adinvolving faith groups, trade unions, education institutions, charities, to name but a few, would go some way to \u00addebunking that idea.<\/p> <p>But, McDonald says, there is an opportunity for Scotland in all this. Like many other nations, the UK Government\u2019s \u00adapproach to combating disinformation is, he says, \u201ca muddle\u201d.<\/p> <p>Depending on its origins and \u00adcategorisation, a falsehood may fall \u00adunder the remit of the MoD, the \u00adCabinet Office, the DCMS, Mi6, or multiple \u00addepartments at once. McDonald says these \u00addiverse \u00adbodies struggle to communicate \u00adeffectively enough to combat the \u201cscourge of disinformation\u201d.<\/p> <p>The SNP MP suggests that Scotland could host annual, worldwide \u201cclean information\u201d summits to help build a \u00adnation which is well protected against such threats, and well placed to help \u00adothers going forward.<\/p> <p>But there may be a need to repair \u00addiscourse in politics first.<\/p> <p>In the US, Stacy says: \u201cThere\u2019s something about the rhetoric in our politics and our public square that is making us prone to seeing the worst in each other.\u201d<\/p> <p>He adds: \u201cLooking at the independence debate as an outsider it would not be hard to imagine further retrenchment into these ideological ghettos.\u201d<\/p> <p>The polarised nature of the constitutional debate has only gotten more extreme since 2014, and where there is \u00addivision, bad faith actors see opportunity.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t create the division,\u201d \u00adMcDonald explains, \u201cthey work out where it is and exploit it\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo long as we don\u2019t take it seriously, and weaponisers of disinformation do take their role seriously, we will always be the poorer for it.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3ZRKL6Z1EAIT71I45KV8GPIEMWTSGN"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":582,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Scotland","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"average people, civilians, misinformation, disinformation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Scotland","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"average people, civilians, misinformation, disinformation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":889233885,"Input.title":"Egypt: UPR Submission November 2019","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-26 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Introduction<\/p> <p>President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi won a second presidential term in March 2018 elections that were held in a largely unfree and unfair environment. President al-Sisi rose to power on the heels of the June 30 mass protests, when he, as the then-defense minister, led the Egyptian military\u2019s move to unseat Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi. He was elected for his first presidential term in the summer of 2014, and since that time his government has dramatically escalated the state\u2019s repression and violence against his fellow citizens to stifle all forms of dissent.<\/p> <p>The human rights situation in Egypt has collapsed since Egypt\u2019s last Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2014. Instead of implementing even small steps towards justice for the most serious crimes, authorities have relied on a state of emergency and repressive counterterrorism laws to suppress freedoms of expression and association and to largely silence peaceful dissent, including by prosecuting journalists and human rights activists. Abusive state agencies, particularly the Interior Ministry\u2019s National Security Agency and the police, have tortured, abused, and disappeared opponents with near-total impunity. The government has further restricted basic freedoms, including through new legislation passed by parliament, which has largely become a rubber stamp for Al-Sisi\u2019s policy decisions. The March 2018 presidential vote was held in an unfree, unfair environment. Under such severe repression, authorities have been moving to pass constitutional amendments that would end any judiciary independence and invite army intervention in politics.<\/p> <p>Legislative and Constitutional Human Rights Framework<\/p> <p>Though it contained important human rights guarantees, Egypt\u2019s 2014 constitution fails to address many of the pressing rights issues in the country. In practice, authorities have shown little respect for constitutional guarantees of rights and have even passed laws that contradict them despite its acceptance of the 2014 recommendation to \u201ccontinue efforts to harmonize national legislation with international norms.\u201d<\/p> <p>Contrary to the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to \u201cstrengthen measures, including the adoption of necessary legislation, to give effect to the rights enshrined in ICCPR,\u201d authorities have been using counterterrorism and state-of-emergency laws and courts to subvert rights protections and unjustly prosecute bloggers, activists, and ordinary citizens for their peaceful criticism.<\/p> <p>President al-Sisi declared a nation-wide state of emergency in April 2017, following Islamic State-claimed church bombings that killed 45 people. The state of emergency has been uninterruptedly renewed since then. The 1958 Emergency Law gives unchecked powers to security forces to arrest people and allows the government to impose media censorship and order forced evictions. A constitutional court ruling annulling some of these powers was quickly circumvented by new amendments the parliament passed that granted al-Sisi the power to re-apply these abusive practices.<\/p> <p>Examples of abusive new laws that severely undermine citizens\u2019 rights include:<\/p> <p>Law 70 of 2017 known as the new NGO law. It effectively attempts to eliminate independent human rights work, places all NGOs under the effective veto power of a council dominated by representatives of the security agencies, and allows the government to dissolve NGOs based on broadly-worded infractions.<\/p> <p>Law 180 of 2018 for regulating media. It ushered in increased levels of government censorship of the media, including news websites and social media. Around 600 websites, including those of human rights and media organizations, have been blocked without a court order in 2017 and 2018.<\/p> <p>Law 95 of 2015 for counterterrorism. The law erodes basic rights and espouses an overly broad definition of terrorism that includes civil disobedience and free expression. It also prevents police officers from questioning for any use of force during counterterrorism operations.<\/p> <p>Law 8 of 2015 on \u201cTerrorist Entities.\u201d The government used the law to list hundreds of individuals and entities on the country\u2019s \u201cterrorism list\u201d without any hearings or trials, and instead mainly based on unchallenged memos submitted by prosecutors.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Repeal or drastically revise all abusive laws, including those listed above, and ensure that all laws comply with Egypt\u2019s international obligations;<\/p> <p>Withdraw new constitutional amendments that would further undermine judiciary independence and provide for military intervention in politics.<\/p> <p>Impunity and Security Forces\u2019 Serious Abuses<\/p> <p>Excessive Use of Force and Extrajudicial Executions.<\/p> <p>Egypt failed to implement the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to \u201cinvestigate excessive use of force by security forces\u201d and to \u201cprosecute those identified as being responsible.\u201d<\/p> <p>More than five years after the systematic mass killing of protesters in Rab\u2019a Square in Cairo, in August 2013, the authorities did not question or investigate a single member of the security forces responsible for the killing of at least 817 people that day during their violent dispersal of the largely-peaceful sit-in supporting former President Mohamed Morsy.<\/p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch\u2019s review of official Interior Ministry\u2019s statements, the ministry\u2019s security forces have killed at least 270 persons between 2015 and 2018 in more than 80 incidents which the ministry claimed the people were killed in shootouts but provided limited or no evidence to justify the deadly use of force. No transparent investigations were allowed into such incidents. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented how several of those incidents, two of which were video-recorded, appeared to be extrajudicial killings including the killing of previously detained persons in likely staged \u201cshoot-outs.\u201d<\/p> <p>Enforced Disappearance and ill-treatment and Torture.<\/p> <p>Egypt failed to implement the 2014 UPR recommendations to prosecute and punish \u201cpossible crimes committed by security officers\u201d and to ensure \u201call detained persons are protected by law and physically against torture and all other ill-treatment.\u201d A 2017 Human Rights Watch investigation discovered that torture is being used systematically and on a widespread scale in Egypt. Interior Ministry police and National Security Forces have disappeared hundreds of people in the past years and subjected scores to severe torture including by electric shocks, rape and threat of rape. Since July 2013, the independent campaign \u201cStop Enforced Disappearance\u201d has documented 1,530 enforced disappearances from July 2013 to August 2018. According to the Egyptian newspaper Al Watan, which cited statistics from the Justice Ministry\u2019s Forensic Medical Authority, at least 90 people died in local police stations and security directorates in the governorates of Cairo and Giza alone in 2014. This number reached 118 in 2017, according to a detailed report published by the Egyptian NGO El-Nadeem Centre.<\/p> <p>Egypt did not amend its laws to properly define torture and enforced disappearance crimes. On the contrary, the Egyptian government added more layers of protection for security officials. In July 2018, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi approved Law No.161 of 2018 on the \u201ctreatment of the armed forces\u2019 senior commanders,\u201d which shielded senior military commanders from being questioned for abuses that occurred between July 2013 and January 2016 unless the Supreme Council of Armed Forces gives permission. The 2015 counterterrorism law states that officers cannot be questioned for the use of force during counterterrorism operations.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Ensure security forces act in accordance with international human rights laws and standards on the use of force, including the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;<\/p> <p>Ensure that all those detained are protected from torture or other ill-treatment, and that detention conditions meet international standards;<\/p> <p>Repeal all laws that grant impunity to security officials from being questioned over abuses such as the 2015 counterterrorism law;<\/p> <p>Bring the crimes of torture and enforced disappearance in national law into conformity with the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;<\/p> <p>Ensure that investigations into human rights violations are impartial, independent and effective. The Justice Ministry should appoint a commission composed of law professors, legal experts, human rights activists and prosecutors with concrete powers to transparently and openly initiate criminal investigations into torture and disappearance crimes;<\/p> <p>Immediately launch open, transparent investigations into the unlawful use of lethal force by security forces that has resulted in the killing of thousands of protesters and bystanders;<\/p> <p>Establish torture-prevention mechanisms including by allowing independent oversight over all detention places, and in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.<\/p> <p>Unfair Trials, Selective Justice and Death Penalty<\/p> <p>Since its 2014 UPR, Egypt also failed to implement an accepted recommendation to ensure \u201cfair, equitable and independent judicial procedures.\u201d In their prosecution of activists and peaceful opponents, Egyptian authorities used Emergency State Security Courts, a parallel judicial system re-instated since October 2017, under the state of emergency that the government uses to prosecute political activists. These courts do not guarantee a fair trial and their decisions are not subject to appeal. The 2014 constitution permits military trials for civilians. Between October 2014, when al-Sisi decreed a law that vastly expanded military court jurisdiction, and late 2017, authorities have referred more than 15,000 civilians to military prosecutions. Many of these unfair trials ended in death sentences. Egyptian laws provide for the death penalty for over 100 offenses. Death sentences and executions have sharply increased in recent years.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Cease the practice of trying civilians before military trials;<\/p> <p>Abolish State Security Courts;<\/p> <p>Ensure that all those detained on recognizably criminal charges are tried in proceedings that fully conform with international fair trial guarantees, without recourse to the death penalty;<\/p> <p>Repeal all laws that allow for prosecuting people for peacefully exercising or demanding their civil, political, cultural and economic rights such as the 2018 new medial regulations and the 2013 protest law;<\/p> <p>Issue a moratorium on the death penalty as a matter of priority.<\/p> <p>Restrictions against Freedom of Expression, Assembly, and Association<\/p> <p>During its last UPR, Egypt accepted recommendations to \u201cadopt the law affirming the right to establish nongovernmental organizations merely upon notification\u201d and to provide and guarantee an environment \u201cconducive to the work of journalists, human rights defenders and civil society organizations.\u201d Despite this, President al-Sisi ratified the NGO law in May 2017 that criminalizes the work of NGOs, providing for up to five-year prison terms for failing to adhere to its provisions such as operating or receiving funds without government approval. During President al-Sisi\u2019s tenure, Egypt has become among the worst three jailers of journalists in the world with roughly 25 journalists in jail in March 2019, despite the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to \u201cguarantee the freedom of expression\u201d and to \u201cprotect journalists from violence and harassment.\u201d Authorities have continued the prosecutions of scores of the country\u2019s leading human rights activists and organizations in case 173 of 2011, known as the \u201cforeign funding\u201d case, despite the UN, US, and EU calls to end them.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Immediately cease harassment and persecution of opposition activists exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including defamation campaigns and threats;<\/p> <p>Release and drop charges against all those detained solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including national and international media personnel arrested in the context of performing their duties as journalists;<\/p> <p>Also release and drop charges against all those detained for exercising their rights to freedom of association, including those detained solely for membership in the Muslim Brotherhood. The government should amend Law 107 of 2013 restricting freedom of assembly to bring it in line with international standards on freedom of assembly and association.<\/p> <p>Abuses against Religious Minorities<\/p> <p>Egypt\u2019s 2014 constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the rights of minorities and the country accepted a 2014 UPR recommendation to ensure \u201cthe respect for freedom of religion or belief for all its citizens\u201d and to \u201ctake further steps to ensure the promotion of the values of tolerance.\u201d But authorities continued to prosecute writers and activists on charges of \u201ccontempt of religion\u201d and \u201cblasphemy,\u201d including religious minorities and proclaimed atheists. In 2015, courts handed prison sentences to two men, who later went into hiding, for allegedly supporting atheism online. The same year also witnessed prosecutors in Beni Suef governorate ordering a local man arrested for allegedly posting cartoons online that insulted the prophet Mohamed.<\/p> <p>Egyptian Copts, who comprise roughly 10 percent of the population and are the largest Christian minority in the Middle East, have faced abuses and been targeted by extremist groups. Authorities failed to protect the Coptic community from sectarian violence and terrorist attacks. ISIS targeted Egyptian Christians on several occasions during the last few years killing scores of church-goers.<\/p> <p>The restrictive Law 80 of 2016 on the construction of churches allowed for legalizing scores of churches that were operating without an official permit, but restrictions remain largely in place and hundreds of churches without a permit lack legal protection. The rights group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) documented the closure by the authorities of 14 churches in 2018 alone.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Cease harassment and persecution of members of religious minorities including atheists, Christian Copts, and Shia\u2019 Muslims;<\/p> <p>Take steps to ensure the full and effective protection of the lives and property of religious minorities by holding accountable those responsible for attacks against religious minorities and investigating instances where security forces failed to respond to such attacks;<\/p> <p>Amend Law 80 of 2016 to remove restrictions on building and renovating churches and end discrimination against Christians.<\/p> <p>Gender-Based Discrimination and LGBT Rights<\/p> <p>Sexual harassment and violence against women remained endemic. Though Egypt accepted the 2014 UPR recommendation to take \u201cmeasures to eliminate discrimination against women,\u201d Egyptian women continued to face discrimination under Egypt\u2019s personal status law on equal access to divorce, child custody, and inheritance. Egypt also accepted the 2014 UPR recommendation to adopt legislation to \u201ccriminalize all forms of violence against women,\u201d yet no law was issued to combat domestic violence including to prevent abuse, protect survivors and prosecute abusers. Other forms of violence against women, including child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), continued in some areas, despite laws strengthening penalties against some of those crimes. However, in practice, authorities have prosecuted very few perpetrators despite how widespread such acts are.<\/p> <p>Egypt continues to prosecute scores of people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. At least 76 people were prosecuted under the \u201cdebauchery\u201d law based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in 2018. Many are picked up by security officers on the streets, often solely on the basis of their gender-nonconforming appearance. In other cases, security officers entrap LGBT people through dating applications. The arrests in 2018 follow a wave of arrests in 2017, when, security forces arrested at least 75 gay and transgender people and activists after a few activists raised a rainbow flag, a sign of LGBT activism, at a concert in Cairo. Egypt routinely conducts forced anal examinations on people accused of homosexual conduct and, unlike other countries in the region, has taken no steps to ban these exams, which constitute a form of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment according to the UN Committee Against Torture. The government stopped authorizing sex reassignment surgeries for transgender people in 2016 and has provided no pathway to changing gender markers on official documents.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Enact legislation to combat domestic violence and amend personal status laws that discriminate against women on issues of divorce, custody, and inheritance;<\/p> <p>Immediately put an end to the arrest and prosecution of people for their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity;<\/p> <p>End forced anal examinations of persons accused of consensual same-sex conduct and provide a rights-respecting pathway to legal gender recognition, through an administrative process based on self-identification;<\/p> <p>Actively prosecute perpetrators of FGM;<\/p> <p>Lift travel bans and asset freezes of women\u2019s rights activists such as Mozn Hassan and Azza Solimon and allow women\u2019s rights groups to operate independently and without harassment or fear of reprisal.<\/p> <p>Economic and Social Rights Abuses<\/p> <p>Authorities held in May 2018 the first trade union elections in Egypt in 12 years. However, while state officials claimed the elections were transparent and fair, results only reflected the former status quo, with the government-affiliated Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) emerging from the process effectively in control of the unions. The Center for Trade Union and Workers Services, the oldest independent labor rights group in Egypt, said that the elections were marred by violations such as the exclusion from the electoral process of hundreds of candidates not aligned with the government.<\/p> <p>The parliament passed a new trade union law in December 2017. However, in the view of trade unionists and labor activists, the law \"was only issued to win favor with the International Labor Organization,\u201d and it kept in place several restrictions on the right to organize. Strikes remain criminalized in Egyptian law. Authorities arrested or charged at least 180 workers for peaceful workplace strikes and protests in 2016 and 2017, mostly over bonuses and delayed wages.<\/p> <p>Recommendations:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3MG8450X2QPFZR37X8GVPZEU8K1UP9"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":362,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Egypt","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Egyptian citizens, women's rights, sexual assault, gender identity, LGBT rights","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mozn Hassan","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Azza Solimon","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Egypt","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Egyptian citizens, women's rights, sexual assault, gender identity, LGBT rights","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mozn Hassan","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Azza Solimon","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":892594845,"Input.title":"Algeria election: Protesters block polling stations, burn tires in anger","Input.publish_date":"2019-12-13 12:46:56","Input.article_interface":"<p>Arab tyrants frequently lock up dissidents to silence critical voices.

Rehman, who passed away in Lahore on April 12.<\/p> <p>The first speaker was architect Arif Hasan. He divided his talk into three parts: his relationship with Rehman sahib, his personality and legacy. He said he met the late journalist and activist in Lahore in 1967 for the first time where he (Hasan) had gone to work. Although Rehman sahib was 12 or 13 years older than him, they would meet every evening where they\u2019d be joined by the likes of Dr Mehdi Hasan and Nisar Osmani. Rehman sahib used to call the architect \u2018kitab\u2019. Even after he returned to Karachi from Lahore, both kept meeting on a regular basis. Their relationship deepened when Bangladesh was trying to gain independence. Their ties further strengthened during Z.A. Bhutto and Gen Ziaul Haq\u2019s tenures.<\/p> <p>On the second point, Mr Hasan said Rehman sahib was a good listener. He knew how to lend an ear to people. He would never interrupt anyone while they were talking, even when they would be presenting a point of view opposite to his. He never spoke ill of anyone. At meetings and seminars, he would give an opinion that differed from others\u2019 with a sense of humour. He never spoke about himself. Once, he visited his birthplace in Gurgaon, India. When he came back, nobody could detect an air of nostalgia in his narration about his place of birth. He talked about it like a tourist would. He was an extremely well-informed man who turned his wealth of information into knowledge (ilm).<\/p> <p>Mr Hasan, speaking about his legacy, said Rehman sahib has left behind the institutions that he was associated with and founded; his efforts to bring peace between India and Pakistan; his resolve that we should not be afraid of speaking the truth; and the youngsters who in their small but significant ways have established human rights and social welfare groups.<\/p> <p>\u2018He was a good listener, and never spoke ill of anyone\u2019<\/p> <p>Executive director of PILER Karamat Ali said he had worked with Rehman sahib as a trade unionist and human rights activist. He had known him since 1971 when he visited Lahore with Sadequain. Rehman sahib at the time was looking after a newspaper, Azad. He (Ali) was deeply impressed with him from day one. After that he got to work with him at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and alongside him on projects that aimed to bring India and Pakistan closer. Whichever country he visited, it seemed as if it was his own because people there would greet him with a great deal of warmth.<\/p> <p>Mr Ali said Rehman sahib was like a father to him. On April 12, when he passed away, he (Ali) felt like an orphan. Speaking with him used to put him at peace. The late activist respected everyone\u2019s point of view.<\/p> <p>Resident director Sindh, Aurat Foundation, Mahnaz Rahman said on April 12 she was at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) where an event was being held to mark the first death anniversary of journalist Ahfazur Rahman. There, the participants were in shock to receive the news of Rehman sahib\u2019s passing. In September last year, when a condolence reference was held for Ahfazur Rahman at the Arts Council, Rehman sahib came from Lahore and delivered the keynote address.<\/p> <p>She said the news of Rehman sahib\u2019s death flooded social media with messages. She mentioned two of them. One was from an admirer of Rehman sahib who wrote that he\u2019s the \u2018father of human rights\u2019. The second was from a woman activist who said that women always felt comfortable working alongside Rehman sahib because he understood women\u2019s issues. In that regard, she read out excerpts from an article by Rehman sahib which he wrote in favour of Aurat March.<\/p> <p>Earlier, chairperson of PIIA Masuma Hasan introduced the speakers to the online audience. She also briefly talked about Rehman sahib, calling him the leading public intellectual of Pakistan.<\/p> <p>Published in Dawn, April 18th, 2021<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3B6F54KMR4RW3MS1N1A592E8K6CS1N"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":437,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2021","month":"April","date":"12.0","city":"Lahore","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"I.A.

Xu was arrested in August for allegedly organizing anti-corruption demonstrations, becoming one of the first of several dissidents to recently stand trial under Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on civil society. His translated closing statement is excerpted here:<\/p> <p>You have accused me of disrupting public order for my efforts to push for rights of equal access to education and for reforms allowing migrant workers\u2019 children to sit for university entrance examinations where they reside, as well as for my calls that officials publicly declare their assets. While on the face of it, this appears to be an issue of the boundary between a citizen\u2019s right to free speech and public order, what this is, in fact, is the issue of whether or not you recognize a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights. On a still deeper level, this is actually an issue of fears you all carry within: fear of a public trial, fear of a citizen\u2019s freedom to observe a trial, fear of my name appearing online, and fear of the free society nearly upon us. [\u2026] [While] you have not mentioned the New Citizens\u2019 Movement throughout this trial, many of the documents presented here relate to it, and in my view there is no need to avoid the issue. . . . What the New Citizens\u2019 Movement advocates is for each and every Chinese national to act and behave as a citizen, to accept our roles as citizens and masters of our country\u2014not to act as feudal subjects, remain complacent, and accept mob rule or a position as an underclass. . . . [Source]<\/p> <p>Also at Dissent Magazine, Jeffrey Wasserstrom chairs a roundtable \u201con law, reform and repression in China\u201d with Fordham Law School\u2019s Carl Minzner, lawyer Rebecca Liao, the Open Society Foundations\u2019 Thomas Kellogg, and the UC Irvine School of Law\u2019s Benjamin van Rooij. Liao describes Xu\u2019s trial as \u201cdisappointing\u201d and indicative of a step back for legal reform in China:<\/p> <p>Alas, we found out this month that the party\u2019s attempt to understand and implement legal best practices does not apply to all. The trials of Xu Zhiyong and fellow members of the New Citizens\u2019 Movement he founded are a disappointing, befuddling step back for China\u2019s legal reform program. These are the highest-profile legal proceedings since Bo\u2019s trial, and contrasts between the two could not be starker. Xu\u2019s trial was closed to the public and the media. There was no Weibo feed offering a window into the case. The defense was not able to call or cross-examine witnesses. Xu was summarily cut off midway through his statement to the court. At first blush, it would appear that the party has every incentive to replicate the procedural safeguards and transparency of the Bo trial. An international and domestic audience is also watching Xu\u2019s case and passing judgment on China\u2019s legal system, the linchpin of Xi Jinping\u2019s reform agenda. A major difference, however, between Xu\u2019s and Bo\u2019s cases is that the latter was a matter of political infighting. Though the stakes were high, all parties involved were known quantities to one another, compatriots and colleagues working, at the end of the day, to strengthen the Communist Party. A deal could be struck ahead of time. The party had no such luxury with Xu and therefore believed it had to circumvent legal procedure to retain control of the trial\u2019s messaging. [Source]<\/p> <p>Maya Wang at Human Rights Watch adds that the Chinese government \u201cshould think hard about the road they are taking\u201d when choosing to crackdown on the New Citizens\u2019 Movement:<\/p> <p>The current crackdown is arguably one of the biggest and most concerted in the past twenty years. Ten activists who organize under the banner of Xu\u2019s New Citizens Movement have gone on trial within months\u2014and that is not counting the detentions and imprisonment of many others not even related to the New Citizens effort. At the same time, the government has systematically tightened other contentious spaces for public activism, putting new controls on the Internet, mass media and even universities. Pressure in Tibet and Xinjiang has also intensified, culminating with the arrest of Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti in mid-January for the crime of \u201csplittism.\u201d What makes this latest round of repression distressing is that the message of the rights defense movement and the New Citizens Movement in particular was modest, inclusive and constructive. Xu borrowed the language of the government on the rule of law and justice, and that should have made him less of a threat. The New Citizens Movement never organized opposition parties or explicitly pushed for multi-party democracy, which is the Communist Party\u2019s greatest fear, but Xi Jinping and his new government seem unable to tolerate even moderate critics.
