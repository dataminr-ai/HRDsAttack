This represents the largest number of migrant apprehensions in February since 2006.<\/p> <p>Reuters published previously unreported numbers showing that Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 100,000 migrants in February. If the numbers are accurate, they represent an increase of nearly 33 percent from January. Officials expect the official numbers to be released next week.<\/p> <p>The rapidly increasing number of apprehensions follows the abandonment of Trump-era border security and immigration control policies by President Joe Biden during his first days in office.<\/p> <p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sent a letter to President Biden on Friday requesting a meeting to discuss \u201cgreat concerns\u201d with the administration\u2019s approach to the border, Reuters reported.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe must acknowledge the border crisis, develop a plan, and, in no uncertain terms, strongly discourage individuals from Mexico and Central America from ever making the dangerous journey to our southern border,\u201d McCarthy wrote.<\/p> <p>The number of apprehensions of migrants continues to increase in March with officials acknowledging the arrest of more than 4,500 migrants on Wednesday, the article continues.<\/p> <p>On Thursday, U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar (D-TX) reported the apprehension of approximately 10,000 migrants in the Rio Grande Valley Sector during a seven-day period \u2014 2,500 in the previous two days.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are weeks, maybe even days, away from a crisis on the southern border. Inaction is simply not an option,\u201d Congressman Cuellar said in a written statement. \u201cOur country is currently unprepared to handle a surge in migrants in the middle of the pandemic.\u201d<\/p> <p>Of particular concern is the growing number of unaccompanied minors being apprehended at the border. The massively increasing number led to the Biden administration holding minors in Border Patrol facilities beyond the 72-hour legal limit.<\/p> <p>Democrat leaders in South Texas are also critical of the president\u2019s policies that are forcing the release of migrants infected with COVID-19. Officials in Brownsville, Texas, report more than six percent of migrants being released at a local bus station are testing positive for COVID-19.<\/p> <p>Texas State Senator Jose \u201cChuy\u201d Hinojosa (D-McAllen) also complained about the migrants being released without being tested, Breitbart Texas reported in February. \u201c[Border Patrol agents] were just dropping them off at the bus station without testing them. Obviously, that\u2019s very alarming to all of us in that they\u2019re coming from Central America and through Mexico and to be released into the United States without being tested for COVID is really unconscionable,\u201d the Democrat state senator said.<\/p> <p>Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior news contributor for the Breitbart Texas-Border team.

She sued the Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Mail on Sunday and the MailOnline, for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement following articles published in 2019 that featured segments of a five-page letter she had written to her father, Thomas Markle.<\/p> <p>The duchess said that she was \"grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers and The Mail on Sunday to account for their illegal and dehumanizing practices.\"<\/p> <p>In an emailed statement, she added: \"For these outlets, it's a game. For me and so many others, it's real life, real relationships, and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"<\/p> <p>Mark Warby, the High Court judge, said that the duchess \"had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The Mail articles interfered with that reasonable expectation.\"<\/p> <p>In his judgment, Warby also wrote: \"It was a communication between family members with a single addressee. Precautions were taken to ensure that it was delivered only to him. It was, in short, a personal and private letter. The majority of what was published was about the claimant's own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her father's behaviour - as she saw it - and the resulting rift.\"<\/p> <p>The judge found that publishing the letter infringed the duchess's copyright, but said that the issue of whether the duchess was the \"sole author\" of the letter should be determined at trial. He said that there will be a hearing in early March to determine the next steps in the case.<\/p> <p>In the handwritten letter that the duchess wrote, after her wedding on May 19, 2018, she pleaded with her father to stop talking to the media, saying, \"your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces.\" The British tabloid quoted from the letter and also printed images of the duchess' elaborate handwritten script.<\/p> <p>Associated Newspapers had defended their coverage, saying that the contents of the letter weren't private as alleged and that Thomas Markles had a \"weighty right\" to tell his version of events to set the record straight.<\/p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Mail on Sunday told The Washington Post: \"We are very surprised by today's summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial.<\/p> <p>\"We are carefully considering the judgment's contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal.\"<\/p> <p>Since stepping down as senior royals, Prince Harry and his wife have not backed away from taking legal action against media outlets. He recently won a printed apology and \"substantial damages\" from Associated Newspapers following two articles, in the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over claims he had \"turned his back\" on the armed forces.<\/p> <p>Last year, representatives for the royal couple sent a letter to the editors of the four British tabloids saying that they will not \"offer themselves up as currency for an

detained by Beijing authorities has been formally arrested for \"supplying state secrets overseas\".<\/p> <p>Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Monday that China had revealed it formally arrested Cheng Lei on February 5, after taking her into custody last August without explanation.<\/p> <p>The mother-of-two stands accused of \"illegally supplying state secrets overseas\", Payne said in a statement, without providing details.<\/p> <p>Cheng had been a familiar face on CGTN's English-language channel, conducting interviews with noted CEOs from around the world.<\/p> <p>Born in Hunan province, Cheng is now an Australian national who emigrated to the country as a child, before returning to China and joining the state broadcaster in 2012.<\/p> <p>China does not allow citizens to hold dual nationality.<\/p> <p>On Monday, China's foreign ministry confirmed the arrest Cheng faces, and said her case is being \"processed\".<\/p> <p>Spokesman Wang Wenbin called for Australia to \"respect China's judicial sovereignty and stop interfering in China's handling of the case.\"<\/p> <p>Cheng faces severe punishment if found to have broken China's national security laws.<\/p> <p>Her

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) \/ Australia Global Alumni \/ Handout<\/p> <p>The timing and lack of information about charges raised speculation that her detention was politically motivated, or tit-for-tat retaliation.<\/p> <p>Beijing has reacted angrily to Australia's liberal use of foreign interference laws to block Chinese investment in sensitive sectors and to investigate Chinese influence on the country's public life.<\/p> <p>China was also infuriated by Australia's calls for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, responding with a slew of sanctions against Australian exports.<\/p> <p>Cheng's detention came weeks after Australian authorities raided the homes of Chinese state media journalists.<\/p> <p>Two Australian journalists, Bill Birtles and Michael Smith, fled China shortly after being interrogated about Cheng.<\/p> <p>Payne said the Australian government had visited Cheng six times since she was detained -- most recently on January 27 -- and had \"serious concerns\" about her \"welfare and conditions of detention\".<\/p> <p>\"We expect basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment to be met, in accordance with international norms,\" she said.<\/p> <p>Cheng is the second high-profile Australian citizen to be held in Beijing, after writer Yang Hengjun was arrested in January 2019 on suspicion of espionage.<\/p> <p>Her detention sent shockwaves through China's foreign journalist community.<\/p> <p>Cheng had written a number of Facebook posts critical of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Beijing's approach to the coronavirus outbreak.<\/p> <p>One post poked fun at Xi's visit in March to Wuhan, the Covid-19 ground zero: \"The big story today, Dear Leader's visit, triggered

Neither the Tanzanian central authorities nor Zanzibari authorities have acknowledged, let alone investigated, the full scale and toll of the violence, despite a public outcry within the country, and calls for investigations, including by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.<\/p> <p>\u201cTanzania\u2019s authorities have not taken steps to ensure justice for family members of those who died, and survivors of the serious abuses that marred Zanzibar\u2019s 2020 elections,\u201d said Oryem Nyeko, Tanzania researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe leaders of both Zanzibar and Tanzania should demonstrate their commitment to justice by ensuring accountability and compensation for survivors and the families of those who died at the hands of government security forces.\u201d<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 57 people by phone between October 2020 and November 2021, including victims and witnesses, journalists, and opposition party officials about election-related violence in Zanzibar, the semiautonomous archipelago.<\/p> <p>Around October 26, 2020, the Tanzanian government deployed an estimated 10,000 security forces to Unguja and Pemba islands in Zanzibar, just before Zanzibar\u2019s two-day voting period on October 27 and 28. The residents interviewed said that security forces patrolled the streets, harassed residents and beat them, brandishing guns and chasing them away from public spaces, broke into homes, and indiscriminately fired teargas and live bullets. They imposed and enforced curfews, beating those who did not comply, and arbitrarily arrested residents, detaining some in unofficial sites for weeks. This climate of fear caused many people to flee affected areas across Zanzibar. \u201cThose who couldn\u2019t run were beaten,\u201d said a 59-year-old resident of Nungwi, Unguja.<\/p> <p>On the evenings of October 26, 27, and 28 security forces shot into crowds near polling places on Pemba Island, killing at least nine people, including a 16-year-old student and a pregnant woman. On October 28 the violence and the chaos intensified as Zanzibar Electoral Commission officials counted the votes and the \u201cMazombi,\u201d a Zanzibar government-aligned militia group, chased and beat people, including those who came to witness the counting.<\/p> <p>Almost all the witnesses interviewed said they did not report the killings because of the climate of fear brought on by the violence. Family members said when they did report killings to the police and other authorities, nothing came of it. One man said that the police fatally shot his 25-year-old son in the chest in the Kangagani village square in Pemba between 9 and 10 p.m. on October 27. He reported the shooting to a community leader and the police. He buried his son the next day, alongside two others who were killed that night. Human Rights Watch found that the police have still not taken any action.<\/p> <p>The Zanzibar authorities also attempted to control media coverage of abuses by blocking accredited journalists from filming security officials and entering some polling places. Police detained three journalists covering an opposition protest for an hour on October 29 in Zanzibar City, Unguja.<\/p> <p>On October 29 the Zanzibar Electoral Commission announced that Hussein Ali Mwinyi, of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, had won the election for president of Zanzibar and that John Magufuli, also of the CCM, had been re-elected president of Tanzania.<\/p> <p>The only official acknowledgment of the killings came on November 11, 2020, from the Tanzanian inspector general of police, Simon Sirro, who told the media that only two people had died during \u201csporadic violence\u201d on October 26 and that opposition supporters killed a policeman on October 28. He did not address allegations of police involvement in the killings<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch wrote letters to the offices of the presidents of Tanzania and Zanzibar, and to the Tanzania police force, to share findings and ask about the steps the authorities have taken to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by police officers, soldiers, and militia during the Zanzibar election, but has yet to receive a response.<\/p> <p>Zanzibar has experienced election-related violence in the past, especially during the 2000 and 2015 elections. \u201cEvery five years, people are killed and maimed,\u201d said a resident of Pandani, Pemba. \u201cThis happens every election, and always after the elections, we don\u2019t sleep at home.\u201d<\/p> <p>Domestic, regional, and international human rights standards, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, prohibit the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials. Such standards enshrine the right to a remedy for gross human rights violations. Under the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms, security forces may use force only in proportion to the seriousness of the offense, and the intentional use of lethal force is permitted only when strictly unavoidable to protect life.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is important to bring the cycles of election-related violence in Zanzibar to an end,\u201d Nyeko said. \u201cFor this to happen, the Tanzanian and Zanzibari authorities should take urgent steps to rein in security forces and ensure justice.\u201d<\/p> <p>For more details about the 2020 election-related violence in Zanzibar, accounts from victims and witnesses, and recommendations, please see below.<\/p> <p>Click to expand Image Zanzibar's anti-riot police officers stand guard by a group of men sitting on the ground during an operation after the opposition called for protests in Stone Town, on October 29, 2020 as tensions rise while the results of the general election are being announced.  2020 Marco Longari\/AFP via Getty Images<\/p> <p>Governance, Police, and Justice Structures<\/p> <p>Zanzibar is a semiautonomous archipelago consisting of several islands off the coast of mainland Tanzania. Zanzibar is governed by both the central union government of Tanzania in Dodoma and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (Serikali Mapinduzi ya Zanzibar, SMZ) in Zanzibar City.<\/p> <p>Various security forces, as well as the Zanzibar government-affiliated militia, the Mazombi, were active in Zanzibar during the 2020 elections. The Tanzania Police Force and the army, the Tanzania People\u2019s Defence Forces (TPDF), are administered by the central union government and operate in both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. The Zanzibar Police Division is part of the larger Tanzania Police Force. Zanzibar also operates its own security forces, known as the \u201cspecial departments,\u201d \u201cSMZ forces,\u201d or the \u201cVikosi,\u201d alongside the Tanzania Police Force. The Mazombi, or \u201cJanjaweed,\u201d are armed, hooded men in black civilian clothes.<\/p> <p>Unlike the centrally administered police force and army, both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar have separate Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions that are responsible for initiating, prosecuting, and supervising all criminal prosecutions in their respective jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>History of Election Violence in Zanzibar<\/p> <p>In January 2001 Tanzanian security forces killed at least 35 people and injured 600 in Zanzibar for protesting irregularities in the October 2000 elections. During a re-run of the 2015 presidential elections in March 2016, Zanzibar authorities violently arrested opposition members, banned public rallies, and suspended radio stations. The 2015 elections and the 2016 re-run were further hampered by the Mazombi threatening and harassing civilians and government critics. Unidentified men, suspected to be state agents, also abducted and threatened a Zanzibar-based journalist for covering the 2016 re-run.<\/p> <p>Neither the Tanzanian nor Zanzibari authorities have adequately investigated these abuses. The impunity for abuses by members of the ruling CCM party has thus contributed to the cycles of election-related violence, including the most recent events, in October 2020.<\/p> <p>Security Force, Mazombi Abuses in Zanzibar during the 2020 Elections<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch found that during the 2020 elections, the Tanzanian and Zanzibar security forces, including the police, military, and Vikosi, as well as the Mazombi beat, teargassed, harassed, and shot residents on Unguja and Pemba islands, starting just before and ending just after the voting period. Some residents abandoned their homes and hid in neighboring forested areas for days or weeks.<\/p> <p>\u201cSome people felt they were not safe to return [even after the elections],\u201d said a 33-year-old resident of Kangagani village, Pemba. \u201c[We didn\u2019t return home] for two months until the situation came back to normal, and everyone was confident to come back.\u201d<\/p> <p>Many witnesses and some victims\u2019 family members said they did not report the abuses out of fear. \u201cI didn\u2019t report [his killing] anywhere,\u201d said the relative of a man who was killed on Pemba. \u201cFirst it was panic, we didn\u2019t expect this to happen. Secondly, where do you report? Who will listen to you?\u201d<\/p> <p>Beatings, Break-ins<\/p> <p>On October 26, 2020, masked security forces in unidentifiable uniforms began arriving in Nungwi village, northern Unguja. They announced an 8 p.m. curfew. Some witnesses said that they harassed people and broke into homes for at least four days, targeting young men for beatings. Police and soldiers caned anyone outside after curfew, including those returning home after prayer at about 8 p.m.<\/p> <p>On October 27, the day set aside for security personnel to vote, people in Nungwi were instructed to remain indoors after 1 p.m. Witnesses said that Mazombi beat anyone outside after 1 p.m. From about 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on October 28, the day set aside for the general population to vote, a witness said, the Mazombi set up a makeshift camp in Nungwi, took several people there, and beat them.<\/p> <p>\u201cI could hear the voice of a man called Haji Hajibu,\u201d said a 54-year-old witness. \u201cHe was brought here and beaten. He was stripped naked and told to go to a shop and find clothes.\u201d The same witness said they had heard rumors about some rapes of women, but Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate this.<\/p> <p>That night, Nungwi residents protested the repression by blocking roads with stones and burning tires. The police responded with live bullets. Meanwhile, the security forces and Mazombi continued to break into and loot homes and shops and to beat people. \u201cDoors were being smashed and forced entries were being made,\u201d a 59-year-old resident of Nungwi said.<\/p> <p>In the Garagara neighborhood, Zanzibar City, security forces beat a 23-year-old man attending his shop, forced him to roll in a puddle of water, and humiliated him by forcibly cutting his hair with a knife.<\/p> <p>Burning, Shooting of Unarmed Residents<\/p> <p>From October 26 to 29, and again on November 11, numerous witnesses said security forces indiscriminately fired teargas and shot people in various locations on Unguja and Pemba, mostly at polling places, killing at least 14 people.<\/p> <p>Throughout the evening and night of October 26, security forces shot teargas and live bullets at people who had gathered at Chwaka Primary School, a polling place in Tumbe, northern Pemba, after hearing rumors that CCM supporters had been transported there to vote. At around midnight, Abdalla Said Abdalla, 24, was killed.<\/p> <p>A humanitarian worker described the chaos:<\/p> <p>Many Vikosi and police started coming. Even the army. [The security forces] were firing teargas and bullets. Just for the sake of firing. Everywhere. We were on the main road and could see [an official] was issuing orders: do this, do this.<\/p> <p>On the night of October 26 security forces shot people in the Kangagani village center, Pemba, killing at least three, including Asha Haji Hassan, who was pregnant. A 36-year-old witness, who was shot in her left thigh by armed uniformed men whom she believes were police and members of the Vikosi as she walked near the polling place at Kangagani Primary School about 9 p.m., said of Hassan\u2019s shooting:<\/p> <p>I saw the men [who shot Asha and me], they came out of the voting center, they came on the main road. I don\u2019t know the number, but they were many. Some kneeled, came down from the car, and shot. I believe those who kneeled were the ones who shot at me and the pregnant woman.<\/p> <p>A relative of Kombo Hamad Salim, 32, said that security forces in a police truck shot Salim in the chest about 30 minutes later as he sat with his friends on the playground of Kangagani Primary School. He died immediately.<\/p> <p>In Garagara, witnesses said, security forces fatally injured a 73-year-old woman after throwing teargas into her home. At around 11 a.m. on October 27, six armed men, believed to be from the Vikosi, based on their uniforms, went to the home of Saada Ali Hassan and demanded that her family surrender the young men living there. Shortly after they refused, the men threw teargas canisters and a flammable liquid at the house, causing it to catch fire. Hassan was resting and recovering from an illness in her room. Her 50-year-old daughter said:<\/p> <p>Mattresses were burning. Doors burning. She could not help herself. We had to try to help her, but we couldn\u2019t because the fire was intense. It was very smoky. She was calling for help from her daughters.<\/p> <p>A policeman unaffiliated with the Vikosi entered and pulled Hassan from the room. The armed men stood by and watched without interfering or assisting. Hassan had severe burns, so her family took her to Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar City, where she remained until her death on December 8.<\/p> <p>Just after midnight on October 27 security forces guarding ballot boxes at the Mtemani Primary School, a polling place in Wete district, Pemba, shot live bullets at passersby, hitting at least three people, including a 16-year-old student, Massoud Salim Fadhal. His father said his other children saw a person in a black car instructing the security forces to shoot people outside the school.<\/p> <p>Ali Kombo Omar, a cleric at a nearby Islamic school who cleaned and prepared Fadhal\u2019s body for burial, said the body was still bleeding from a bullet wound in his back.<\/p> <p>At about the same time, in Kinazini village, Pemba, security forces fired teargas and live bullets, hitting Ali Said Kombo, 28, who was with friends at a polling place watching the ballot boxes brought in for voting. His family did not take him to the hospital because they were afraid to go out due to the chaos, and he died several hours later.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey were teargassing, using live bullets,\u201d said one of Kombo\u2019s friends. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the people, but by the signs and their cars, they were security people.\u201d He noted that they drove Toyota Defenders, the model used by security forces in Tanzania.<\/p> <p>Witnesses at the Vitongoji Primary School polling place in Vitongoji town, Chake Chake district, Pemba, said that at about 1 a.m. on October 27, policemen believed to be part of the anti-riot Field Force Unit, based on their green uniforms, killed Mohammed Khalfan Mjaka, 35, and injured a 30-year-old man in the leg. The policemen shot Mjaka about six times in his chest, they said.<\/p> <p>The security forces\u2019 violence continued into the morning. At 10 a.m. on October 27, police shot and killed Salum Ali Abdalla, 38, at his neighbor\u2019s shop near his home in Kipangani neighborhood, Wete. A witness said that Abdalla tried to flee when two policemen stormed the shop. One of them shot him in the back as he ran and then attempted to conceal the evidence by rubbing dirt over the bloodstains on the ground. The policemen drove off with his body, which was eventually taken to Wete Hospital.<\/p> <p>Two people, including a close friend of Hamad Shehe Ali, 35, witnessed his killing in Konde, Micheweni district, northern Pemba. On the evening of October 27, hooded, uniformed, and armed men, traveling in a fast-moving convoy of unmarked cars led by a police car and a Vikosi truck, shot their guns, causing people to run and hide. One bullet hit Ali, who was on his way with two other people, to Konde Primary School, a polling place, in the chest. A close friend who was with him said that onlookers carried Hamad to Wete Hospital, where he died.<\/p> <p>In Garagara, Said Makame Ali, 18, left his relatives\u2019 home at around 9:30 a.m. on October 28 to walk to the town center with one of his cousins. They encountered uniformed men clashing with people and firing teargas who chased them, the cousin said:<\/p> <p>There was a wall we had to jump but Said couldn\u2019t jump. That\u2019s how they caught him. While he was trying to go over the wall, he was hit by a bullet. It was only one bullet. I saw him clutching his leg in agony.<\/p> <p>Ali\u2019s cousin escaped, but his family was only able to locate Ali\u2019s body three days later at the Mnazi Mmoja Hospital morgue. Another relative said he observed the injury on Ali\u2019s leg and his body was still bleeding when they found him.<\/p> <p>On October 29, at about 9:15 a.m., assailants shot Mussa Haji Mussa, 28, four times \u2013 in the chest, both shoulders, and one leg \u2013 outside his home in Nungwi. Family members took Mussa to the nearby hospital, but he was dead on arrival. One relative said Mussa had been sick at the time and would have been resting inside his home. He believes the assailants were government-affiliated security forces and had dragged Mussa from his house, then shot him.<\/p> <p>Mussa\u2019s family reported the matter to the police who, possibly fearing a riot, provided security at his burial. However, the authorities have not provided updates about any investigation into his killing in the year since.<\/p> <p>After the elections, the security forces maintained their presence in most of the areas where abuses had occurred and continued to intimidate residents.<\/p> <p>On November 11 security forces with the Kikosi cha Valantia Zanzibar (KVZ) division of the Vikosi shot Said Salum Suleiman, 34, on a street in Mwembe Makumbi neighborhood, Zanzibar City, as he transported sand in a donkey cart with his brother. Suleiman\u2019s brother described their encounter with six officers before Suleiman\u2019s death:<\/p> <p>It was me who was negotiating with them. It was then that Said joined the conversation. They tried to stop Said from joining, but he said he was going to join to see what was happening to his brother. One of them said, \u201cI will shoot you. Don\u2019t come this way.\u201d But he still insisted on following me. [The officer] just shot the bullet and hit him in the stomach, right on the navel. He died instantly.<\/p> <p>Suleiman\u2019s family later heard that the officer who shot him was arrested and taken to court, but they have not received further information about the proceedings or been called to testify.<\/p> <p>Torture of Detainees<\/p> <p>Three former detainees told Human Rights Watch that on October 26, hooded, armed men dragged them from their homes, blindfolded them, beat them, and drove them for about 30 minutes to a house. They were kept in a room there, regularly beaten, and warned to \u201cstay out of politics.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThe system was that before a meal, we were beaten, then provided with a meal,\u201d a former detainee said. \u201cThey mostly used wires and hammers. We were hit with hammers on the joints.\u201d<\/p> <p>Six days before their release, the beatings stopped and officials wearing prison guard uniforms brought doctors who treated the victims. By November 15, 19 days after their abductions, all the men, except Ameir Ameir Soud, were blindfolded and dumped in different locations.<\/p> <p>Soud, a 72-year-old well-known political commentator and government critic in Bwejuju, Unguja, was abducted while he was alone at home, his wife said.<\/p> <p>A fellow detainee said that during their detention, Soud was taken to a torture room and never returned. Twenty-four days after Soud\u2019s abduction, his family learned he had been dumped at Madema police station, in Zanzibar City, found him, and transferred him to a nearby hospital. His wife said:<\/p> <p>He was in a very bad condition. His legs were not functioning. He had eye problems. He was weak. He told me that he was tortured. He said it was a terrible situation. I couldn\u2019t ask more.<\/p> <p>He died days later, on November 24, 2020, in a hospital.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>To end the cycles of election-related violence in Zanzibar:<\/p> <p>Authorities in Tanzania and Zanzibar, including the Tanzania Police Force and the SMZ special departments, should identify and dismantle any structures that enable government-allied militias to operate in Zanzibar, and close all unofficial places of detention; and<\/p> <p>The governments of Tanzania and Zanzibar should demobilize all existing irregular security militias, including the Mazombi.<\/p> <p>The international community, including partners of Tanzania, as well as the African Union and its human rights experts, should urge the Tanzanian authorities

Being acquitted of an unjust arrest sets a precedent, she says.<\/p> <p>Sahouri says she was only doing her journalistic duties when a police officer Luke Wilson pepper sprayed her and her then-boyfriend, who she says insisted on accompanying her for protection. After pepper spraying her \"right in the face at close range,\" the officer then arrested her on the spot and told her, \"'That\u2019s not what I asked,' she recalls.<\/p> <p>She identified herself as a journalist many times throughout the ordeal, she says.

The cases against other members of the press were almost immediately dropped.

He faces up to 15 years in prison.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe trial will be closed. The trial will be not in the court, it will be right in the prison.

In reality, judges can write any number of years in prison,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>For Tsikhanouskaya, it\u2019s yet another test of her ability as an accidental politician to avoid putting her own feelings for her husband above those of the many Belarusians who have been jailed for opposing the government.<\/p> <p>Ad<\/p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my beloved. I\u2019m thinking about him most of all, because I\u2019m talking about him with my children.

Newsrooms everywhere are facing similar requests.<\/p> <p>Vivien Manning wrote to us: \"Protesters across the country are risking their lives to fight against police brutality and murder. By posting photos that expose their faces and identities, you're putting individuals at risk of retaliation, both from racist people online and stronger governmental forces.\"<\/p> <p>And Leah Block wrote: \"Do not forget the Ferguson protesters who died under \"mysterious circumstances\" \u2014 Deandre Joshua, Darren Seals, MarShawn McCarrel, Edward Crawford Jr., Danye Jones (whose mother was an active protester), and Bassem Masri. Their deaths were not coincidental.<\/p> <p>\"I urge NPR to take down the photos of protesters or blur their likenesses entirely. Otherwise, make sure that you have the photo subjects' consents to post their photos and put them at risk, and preferably include a notice of this consent in all of your photo\/video captions.\"<\/p> <p>My answer comes in two parts. Part I: NPR should not institute a policy of obscuring the faces of people photographed while participating in public demonstrations who do not give express permission to have their picture published. NPR is committed to journalism, and that includes chronicling news as it happens and in public. And now, much of the day's events qualify as historic moments.<\/p> <p>Blurring images is a form of photo manipulation that makes them less true, and is generally an unacceptable practice for documentary photography. Photojournalists \u2014 and their news organizations \u2014 certainly can consider genuine concerns for the safety of a person in an image. But rather than default to altering the image, in the spirit of recording the truth of the circumstances, the journalist might first look for another image that conveys a comparable moment without jeopardizing an individual. The bar for manipulating a news photo is so incredibly high that I cannot remember an occasion when it was justified.<\/p> <p>Photojournalism often puts a face on the story and documents the circumstances. Blurring faces can erase the power of that work, as would selecting only images that do not contain identifiable faces. Protesters' faces communicate a range of emotions \u2014 joy, anger, sorrow. Without those emotions, the story would be incomplete and inadequate. Most \u2014 though I recognize that certainly not all \u2014 have chosen to be part of these protests fully aware they are entering a public space and at personal risk. The journalists' job is to convey reality.<\/p> <p>Think of the many historic images of protests and how they galvanized the general public. If we can't see their faces, we won't feel the full impact of what they are feeling or understand the truth of their circumstances. That's the power of a great photo.<\/p> <p>\"The general public's opinions about protests and the social movements behind them are formed in large part by what they read or see in the media,\" wrote Danielle Kilgo, a researcher and an assistant professor of journalism at Indiana University, in a piece that argues that historically newsrooms have been less likely to legitimize anti-black racism protests.<\/p> <p>Photos and video are the most powerful tool in a storyteller's toolkit. On top of that, photos of protests are crucial for storytelling in the digital environment, said Keith Jenkins, NPR senior director of visuals.<\/p> <p>The vast majority of images that appear with NPR content come from The Associated Press or Getty Images, Jenkins said.<\/p> <p>Which brings me to part II of my answer to this concern. Protesters have the opportunity to stay out of the limelight. And photographers on the scenes of protest have opportunities to hear from protesters who would prefer not to be part of the story.<\/p> <p>While some journalists dismiss the fear of harm to the subjects, I find the concern valid. Protesters can get fired, or charged with crimes. While the prospect of racists hunting protesters down is alarming, it seems more likely that social media, not journalistic photos, would be the starting point.<\/p> <p>But after talking to a photo editor from an international wire service, it's clear that photographers don't want to thoughtlessly publish photos of unwilling subjects.<\/p> <p>Photographers working for all the wire services and photo agencies that NPR uses are instructed to identify themselves and ask for names, whenever possible, particularly if there are fewer than three people in a photo, an editor for one of those wire services told me. He asked that I not name him or the wire service, because he has staff in harm's way all around the world and occasionally hostile governments will use his words against one of his employees.<\/p> <p>That means that it's rare that a photo of a single protester or a handful of protesters is distributed without a name. The wire photo editor said photographers don't ask permission, because they don't need it and asking would imply they did. But the minute someone expresses reluctance, the photographer moves on. All professional photographers carry identification.<\/p> <p>If it's a really peaceful protest, usually visible press identification is hanging on a lanyard. But if there is violence, the photographers take the lanyard off their necks for safety and keep their IDs in an exterior pocket, for quick access.<\/p> <p>A quick perusal of NPR's website suggests that photographers are asking protesters for their names. In most photos where a protester can be identified, he or she is named in the caption. Asking for the name gives a protester the opportunity to ask the photographer to not use an image. And while there is no legal obligation to grant the request, in most cases, photographers will do so.<\/p> <p>Of course, there are plenty of photos where protesters are not identifiable.<\/p> <p>However, some images buck this trend. But they appear to be in the minority.<\/p> <p>The best recommendation I can offer to NPR is to eliminate photos in this last category. If the name of an easily identified individual is available, use it in the caption. If the name is not available, consider whether it's the best and only image that conveys an important story that can't be told any other way \u2014 and if possible find another image. When you have a satisfactory alternative, why not use it? Otherwise, the audience will wonder about your judgment \u2014 rather than focus on the story you want them to know.<\/p> <p>Research by Meredith Roaten<\/p> <p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

has been around mechanisms to address and regulate the dissemination of false information and disinformation, in light of the arrests of journalist Hopewell Chin\u2019ono and opposition political officials Job Sikhala and Fadzayi Mahere.<\/p> <p>The trio\u2019s alleged crime was that of publishing a falsehood or communicating false information prejudicial to the state.<\/p> <p>This purported offence is drawn from Section 31 (a) (iii) of the Criminal (Codification and Reform) Act, a part of the law which in all intents and purpose doesn\u2019t only no longer exists in our statutes by virtue of a Constitutional Court ruling, but is also not in sync with the government\u2019s law reform agenda that has, among other developments, repealed repressive legislation such as the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Aippa).<\/p> <p>There have been several articulate submissions around the illegality of the law used to arrest the trio, centered on the precedence set by the Constitutional Court in the ruling against criminal defamation and indeed the principle that no law, including the constitution, which is the supreme law can resurrect statutes that no longer exists.<\/p> <p>One doesn\u2019t need to be a lawyer or constitutional expert to appreciate that even if provisions of a repealed law are in sync with the new law, those former statutes don\u2019t automatically become effective unless and until the provisions are enacted through the recognised law-making processes.<\/p> <p>The arguments, therefore, that the law was resurrected by way of the general amendments are illegitimate.<\/p> <p>To use the repealed Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Aippa) as an example, a general amendment of the title of an officer of say the Zimbabwe Media Commission (ZMC) for all statutes cannot in any way suggest that the repealed law has been reinstated and is effective.<\/p> <p>It is an unsustainable argument that only suggests a leopard doesn\u2019t change its spots and the regime of the so-called second republic is not any different from the first.<\/p> <p>Beyond the submissions on the illegality of the law and therefore arrests, there have been suggestions that the trio had a case to answer before the country\u2019s judiciary as a way of holding peddlers of false information and misinformation accountable.<\/p> <p>To put things into context, the trio recirculated a video that went viral on social media in which a police officer is seen quarrelling amid pushing and shoving among a group of people that audibly accused this police officer of striking and killing a baby with a baton stick.<\/p> <p>In the same visuals, an actively involved woman holding a baby \u2014 who at that time was reported to be the mother of the \u201cdead\u201d baby \u2014 is also seen grabbing the policeman.<\/p> <p>Chin\u2019ono who uses his social media handles as a source for verified and legitimate news and information, being an internationally acclaimed journalist, posted the video, disapproving of the wanton act of violence that the citizens in the video were audibly complaining of and in the process reported the case of the child having been \u201ckilled\u201d as fact.<\/p> <p>Sikhala and Mahere, who by virtue of being in the opposition posit themselves as alternative leaders raised concern at the treatment of citizens by the police, more so that the violence against citizens had led to the \u201cdeath\u201d of an innocent child.<\/p> <p>Thousands of social media users within and outside Zimbabwe also weighed in the condemnation with the narrative that there had been a baby that had lost their life on account of a brutal police force trending.<\/p> <p>Zimbabwe would need to build new prisons if the country were to accommodate those that could have been arrested on the same account as the three high profile figures incarcerated for commenting and recirculating a trending video and subsequent narrative.<\/p> <p>To their credit, police in response to the trending video, initiated an inquiry into what had obtained with their investigations, revealing that there had been a scuffle between a police officer and members of the public after the officer in question had shattered a windscreen of a commuter omnibus with a baton, resulting in the baby being hit by debris.<\/p> <p>However, and perhaps a critical fact according to the police investigation, the baby did not die as those in the video suggested and as the trio and many others widely circulated.<\/p> <p>The police\u2019s role should have started and ended there.<\/p> <p>To then go on and make an arrest, not on account of the investigation but to punish those that had circulated the information that gave you the lead, is not only unfair but outrageous.<\/p> <p>What made the police investigation, report and subsequent action even more interesting is how the narrative of the mother of the baby in a later interview with the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation Television (ZBC TV) differs from the police statement.<\/p> <p>The consistent fact revolved around that the baby is alive and well, which seems to be the state\u2019s main contention.<\/p> <p>It is given that the police report and account by the mother, social media users, including the trio circulated information that was not entirely true.<\/p> <p>It is also given that in this digital age, misinformation and fake information is a challenge that will need multifaceted interventions to address.<\/p> <p>Arresting citizens, dissenting voices and opposition leaders is certainly not one of the ways to curd disinformation.<\/p> <p>The state cannot purport to hold and monitor the truth.<\/p> <p>It is tantamount to criminalising freedom of expression and it is an unsustainable way of regulating or promoting ethical practices on the internet when it comes to the dissemination of news and information.<\/p> <p>As highlighted earlier, it was going to be impractical for the state to prosecute all those that recirculated, commented or reacted to the video that missed critical facts.<\/p> <p>It is actually telling in the persons that were arrested that this was actual fact targeted at journalists and activists.<\/p> <p>This is not to say, especially from a journalistic perspective that the media cannot be held accountable.<\/p> <p>It is to this end that the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe (MAZ) and its partners, among them the press council, journalists\u2019 union, editors\u2019 forum and the Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa Zimbabwe), are consulting on a Media Practitioners law that read together with the soon-to-be-enacted Zimbabwe Media Commission Bill will provide a framework for co-regulation of the media

Such an outcome would not only shake up Belarus, it would also give Russian President Vladimir Putin serious cause for concern.<\/p> <p>At the beginning of this year, Lukashenko seemed unchallengeable. Most Belarusians believed that their strongman leader would win a sixth term in office in the same corrupt way that he had secured his previous victories. Even Lukashenko\u2019s opponents suddenly went silent as he defended Belarusian sovereignty in the face of Putin\u2019s plans to \u201cintegrate\u201d the two post-Soviet states.<\/p> <p>However, COVID-19 has changed everything. As Lukashenko proclaimed the pandemic \u201cnonsense,\u201d and lied regularly about its scope and casualties, ordinary people affected by the crisis started to turn on him.<\/p> <p>They particularly resented pressure by the authorities to attend May 9 commemorations of the end of World War II without masks or protective gloves, and to sign a petition in favor of Lukashenko\u2019s re-election.<\/p> <p>In early May, the authorities arrested the popular blogger Sergey Tikhanovsky, who had announced his intention to run for president.<\/p> <p>However, his wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, is now bidding to stand in his place and has received enthusiastic support.<\/p> <p>Last month, lines to sign her ballot petition in Minsk, Brest and Gomel stretched for nearly a kilometer, despite police urging people to disperse.<\/p> <p>Opinion polls conducted between May 20 and May 22 \u2014 before the authorities banned them \u2014 indicate that only 3 to 6.24 percent of voters support Lukashenko, with Tikhanovskaya at 12.7 to 18 percent and the former Belgazprombank chief executive officer Victor Babariko \u2014 now jailed by the Belarusian KGB \u2014 the clear front-runner, backed by 50 to 54.9 percent of respondents.<\/p> <p>On Tuesday last week, the Belarusian Central Election Commission formally allowed Babariko and Tikhanovskaya to run after it reviewed their supporters\u2019 signatures. A Lukashenko \u201cvictory\u201d over them on Aug. 9 would almost certainly trigger another Eastern European \u201ccolor revolution.\u201d<\/p> <p>However, Lukashenko\u2019s possible demise after a quarter-century of wielding near-dictatorial power is not the only reason why the presidential election matters. The other is the long-standing tendency for political developments in Belarus to foreshadow events in its giant neighbor.<\/p> <p>Russian leaders have been following in Lukashenko\u2019s footsteps since the mid-1990s. Then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin\u2019s 1996 re-election campaign, including its appeal to Russians to \u201cvote with your heart,\u201d was copied straight from Lukashenko\u2019s 1994 campaign. When Putin succeeded Yeltsin in 1999, he \u2014 like Lukashenko three years earlier \u2014 proclaimed the return of \u201cstability.\u201d<\/p> <p>Just as Lukashenko revived the Soviet-era Belarusian flag and seal, Putin restored the Soviet national anthem in Russia. Putin also followed Lukashenko\u2019s lead in eradicating independent political parties and forcing opponents into exile or killing them (and sometimes both).<\/p> <p>In both countries, parliament and the courts were transformed into departments of the presidential administration, while Russian laws concerning \u201cforeign agents\u201d and \u201cunwelcome foreign organizations\u201d emulated Belarusian legislation.<\/p> <p>Finally, Putin\u2019s national referendum on Wednesday last week, which formally allowed him to remain president beyond 2024 \u2014 by resetting the clock on the constitutional limit of two consecutive terms \u2014 mirrored Lukashenko\u2019s in 2004.<\/p> <p>Allowing Russians to vote online or outside of polling stations resembles the week-long \u201cearly voting\u201d period in Belarus, which has secured Lukashenko one victory after another.<\/p> <p>Lukashenko\u2019s defeat next month would thus represent a huge symbolic blow to the Russian version of his political model and could shape Russia\u2019s future much more than Ukraine\u2019s efforts to throw off dictatorship have done. Whereas Russian leaders have long regarded Ukraine as a country that looks to the West rather than following Russia\u2019s path, they view Belarus as Russia\u2019s most trusted friend and ally.<\/p> <p>Russians deeply respect Belarusians for the suffering they endured during World War II, and the two countries\u2019 citizens have enjoyed equal economic status since the establishment of the Union State of Russia and Belarus in 1999. So, while most Russians expected that Ukraine would eventually opt for liberal democracy and reject Soviet-style autocracy, a similar shift in Belarus could shatter the foundations of Putin\u2019s regime.<\/p> <p>Nowadays, Lukashenko seems to be equated with Belarus in the same way that Putin is with Russia. Or, as the current chairman of the Russian Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, put it in 2014: \u201cThere is no Russia today if there is no Putin.\u201d<\/p> <p>Like Lukashenko, Putin is now trying to perpetuate himself in power, deprive voters of any say in decisionmaking, and capitalize on Soviet heritage rather than modernizing the country. Lukashenko\u2019s failure to secure re-election would thus make a deep impression on Russian voters.<\/p> <p>Rising tensions between Putin and Lukashenko make the situation even more intriguing.<\/p> <p>Since 2000, Russia has subsidized Belarus to the tune of more than US$100 billion, receiving nothing but supportive political statements in return. Lukashenko frequently criticizes Putin and leads the Russia-skeptic forces within the Eurasian Union, Putin\u2019s aspirational geopolitical construct.<\/p> <p>Moreover, the Kremlin might no longer have either the ability or the will to intervene in Lukashenko\u2019s favor. The fact that Belarus lacks ethnic divides of the sort that facilitated Russian incursions into Ukraine also weakens Putin\u2019s position.<\/p> <p>The big question now is whether Belarus will follow the same democratic path that Ukraine chose in 2014 \u2014 one hopes without the violence. If Lukashenko falls, then Putin\u2019s regime might also start to appear far less incontestable.<\/p> <p>Vladislav Inozemtsev is the founder and director of the Center for Post-Industrial Studies in Moscow.<\/p> <p>Copyright: Project Syndicate<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":2,"HIT_id":"31MCUE39BM1PNKXPF5U78HA2T4V3GI"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":252,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sergey Tikhanovsky","victim_keywords":"Presidential candidate, Belarus","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Svetlana Tikhanovskaya","victim_keywords":"Presidential candidate, Belarus","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sergey Tikhanovsky","victim_keywords":"Presidential candidate, Belarus","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Svetlana Tikhanovskaya","victim_keywords":"Presidential candidate, Belarus","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":927646095,"Input.title":"Zimbabwe: 1,300 Arrested in 24 Hours over Coronavirus Lockdown","Input.publish_date":"2020-06-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Zimbabwe police arrested 1,312 people nationwide on Tuesday for violating coronavirus quarantine measures as authorities reinforce lockdown restrictions, Zimbabwe\u2019s state-owned newspaper The Herald reported on Thursday.<\/p> <p>National police spokesman Paul Nyathi confirmed Tuesday\u2019s arrests to the newspaper.

Box 500, Carlisle IN 47838<\/p> <p>by Kevin \u2018Rashid\u2019 Johnson<\/p> <p>Introduction<\/p> <p>In December 1990, a Special International Tribunal was held on the existence and abuse of political prisoners and prisoners of war (PPs and POWs) in the United States. The tribunal was conducted both to politically educate the public and as a semi-judicial event to put the Amerikan government on public trial, in light of its persistent denial of the existence of PPs in the U.S. and its use of extreme methods of repression to suppress political activism and expression of the poor, workers, oppressed nationality people of color and their anti-imperialist allies.<\/p> <p>A formal indictment was drawn up against the U.S. government by longtime movement attorneys Jan Susler and Lennox S. Hinds on behalf of nearly 100 PPs and POWs held in the U.S. That indictment enumerated several categories of political imprisonment practiced by the U.S. government. Under \u201cCount III: Cruel, Inhumane and Degrading Treatment,\u201d it identified Amerika\u2019s use of interstate prison transfers as a form of political repression against political prisoners. It stated:<\/p> <p>\u201cRetaliatory Transfers: Political prisoners, including those who have become politicized since their incarceration, are transferred from one prison to another in retaliation for the exercise of their right to free speech and\/or association in the prisons, and\/or to isolate them from outside friends and supporters. Most states and the federal government are now parties to an interstate compact permitting a prisoner in one state to serve his\/her sentence thousands of miles away from home and family.\u201d<\/p> <p>Politicized in captivity<\/p> <p>Since 2012, I have been transferred between states under interstate compacts five times because of my political activities: from my home state of Virginia to Oregon, Texas, Florida, then back to Virginia and now to Indiana. In my transfer to Indiana, I was traded with Shaka Shakur, another prisoner who has been politically active for a number of years and a thorn in the side of Indiana prison officials. He wrote about our swap in a 2019 article.[1]<\/p> <p>I\u2019d spent the first decade of my imprisonment physically warring against abuses of myself and other prisoners in the Virginia prison system. I was first exposed to revolutionary ideas and history and began my political journey in 2001, and from there began writing and working with outside activists.<\/p> <p>In addition to writing political articles, I wrote about the abuses I and others suffered and witnessed, contributed to developing several prisoner support organizations, national and state-based protest actions, cofounded the New Afrikan Black Panther Party \u2013 NABPP, now the Revolutionary Intercommunal Black Panther Party, or RIBPP \u2013 and other efforts.<\/p> <p>I was repeatedly targeted with trumped up criminal indictments for physical resistance, all of which were thrown out in turn with me representing myself.<\/p> <p>In 2009 I was labeled a \u201cdomestic terrorist threat\u201d in the 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment Report written by the Virginia State Police\u2019s fusion center in collaboration with the feds. According to the report, the reason for this slanderous classification and blatant political targeting was the proven \u201cinfluence\u201d of my writings in rallying \u201cprisoners and their associates on the outside to unite against law enforcement and the correctional system,\u201d and my cofounding an organization \u2013 the NABPP \u2013 that sought \u201cto continue the mission of the original Black Panthers.\u201d<\/p> <p>With my work and publicizing prison abuses to the public, the repression I faced changed qualitatively and intensified in comparison to the repression I experienced when I\u2019d responded with isolated physical resistance. I continued writing and organizing and was able to counter a lot of this repression by mobilizing outside supporters and through legal efforts.<\/p> <p>I was also repeatedly targeted with trumped up criminal indictments for physical resistance to guard abuses, including multiple counts of attempted capital murder against guards and felonious assaults, all of which were thrown out in turn with me representing myself.<\/p> <p>Retaliatory transfers<\/p> <p>It was then, in early 2012, that Virginia officials first transferred me without prior notice or hearing to another state, Oregon, where officials attempted to incite racial violence against and between me and various white supremacist prison groups, many of whom I ended up politicizing. I wrote about my Oregon experiences in a 2013 article, \u201cPolitical Struggle in the Teeth of Prison Reaction.\u201d[2]<\/p> <p>My political work and writings about abusive conditions continued in Oregon. I was subjected to repression there through the mentioned attempts to incite violence, bogus disciplinary actions, being thrown in solitary confinement and so on, which did nothing to deter me. Consequently, Oregon officials demanded that Virginia move me elsewhere.<\/p> <p>I was then transferred in 2013 to the notoriously abusive Texas prison system, where as soon as I arrived and while still in chains and defenseless, I was assaulted by guards in riot gear, then by ranking officials \u2013 an assistant warden, major and prison guard captain \u2013 and had my dreadlocks forcibly cut off.<\/p> <p>As soon as the restraints were removed, several physical altercations followed with their riot teams, who retreated, and I was promptly transferred from their reception center to a maximum security prison and thrown into solitary. This all occurred on my first day in the Texas prison system.[3]<\/p> <p>As in Oregon, my political work and writing exposing inhumane prison conditions continued in Texas. Again, repression followed, which I resisted and which had no deterrent effect on me. Texas officials ordered Virginia to remove me.<\/p> <p>As Kimberly Daniels, a Black Florida congresswoman stated after touring one such prison and the terrifying treatment even she received from the staff in 2018: \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep for two days after leaving that place. It\u2019s a culture. That\u2019s a city where the KKK lived. And they work in the prison.\u201d<\/p> <p>This time, during 2017, I was sent to Florida, the country\u2019s most violently and notoriously abusive prison system, and held in that state\u2019s most notoriously abusive prisons \u2013 prisons acknowledged by Florida\u2019s own congressional representatives to be run by the Klan.<\/p> <p>As Kimberly Daniels, a Black Florida congresswoman stated after touring one such prison and the terrifying treatment even she received from the staff in 2018: \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep for two days after leaving that place. It\u2019s a culture. That\u2019s a city where the KKK lived. And they work in the prison.\u201d[4]<\/p> <p>She was talking about the Reception and Medical Center in Lake Butler, Fla., the first prison I was held at when I was first sent to Florida in 2017.<\/p> <p>Compared to my prior interstate placements, repression against me and abuses I witnessed were greatly increased in the Florida prison system. My writing and political work also intensified \u2013 again, I was not curbed.<\/p> <p>In Florida, officials also tried to hide my location from the public and outside supporters and frustrate my ability to communicate with the outside. I was not listed in the state\u2019s online prisoner locator system, and people who called the prisons about me, including attorneys, were told I was located elsewhere.<\/p> <p>The deliberate concealment of my location added a particularly sinister and illegal aspect to my domestic exile, applying a German Nazi tactic of wartime political repression \u2013 enforced disappearance.<\/p> <p>Secret detention is a form of enforced disappearance which has been a crime under international law since the 1946 judgment of the Nuremburg Tribunal against Nazi war criminals. In relevant part, that tribunal convicted Nazi Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel for his role in enforcing Adolf Hitler\u2019s \u201cNight and Fog\u201d decree issued Dec. 7, 1941, that called for secretly detaining and disappearing people deemed a threat to German security but \u201cwho were not to be immediately executed.\u201d[5]<\/p> <p>After a physical altercation between me and guards, which was prompted by my speaking out about their routinely refusing meals and assaulting a neighboring prisoner who suffered obvious mental illness, Florida officials demanded that Virginia remove me \u201cwithin five days.\u201d<\/p> <p>Because Virginia officials didn\u2019t have any other state willing to accept me within that timeframe, they had to temporarily take me back in. Upon my return, I was housed so as to keep me isolated from other prisoners. They admittedly feared my influence on others and exposing their mistreatments to the public.<\/p> <p>Initially I was held alone in a completely empty cellblock in the state\u2019s super-maximum security Red Onion State Prison. Then I was moved to the state\u2019s death row at Sussex One State Prison, where only three death row prisoners remained. They were ordered by the warden not to communicate with me. When these prisoners openly defied the warden, I was then moved into another isolated cellblock and denied outside exercise and other basic entitlements.<\/p> <p>Snitch jacketing is a particularly sinister counterintelligence tactic commonly used by the pigs specifically to destroy independent activists and organizations modeled after the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) against the BPP and American Indian Movement.<\/p> <p>Efforts to isolate me continued until Virginia officials finally negotiated with Indiana to take me. Here in Indiana, where I remain, officials have again tried to hide my location by not listing me in the state\u2019s online prisoner locator system.<\/p> <p>Upon our being traded, both Shaka Shakur and I have been targeted with various well-established \u201ccounterintelligence\u201d tactics, calculated to discredit and isolate us and incite conflict with prisoners, including official efforts to falsely portray us as informants \u2013 putting \u201csnitch jackets\u201d on us \u2013 to other prisoners in these \u201calien\u201d states where we are relatively unknown to other prisoners.<\/p> <p>Snitch jacketing is a particularly sinister counterintelligence tactic commonly used by the pigs specifically to destroy independent activists and organizations. Ward Churchill wrote about it in his book on the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) against the BPP and American Indian Movement, where he explained:<\/p> <p>\u201c\u2018Snitch-jacketing\u2019 or \u2018bad-jacketing\u2019 refers to the practice of creating suspicion \u2013 through the spread of rumors, manufacture of evidence etc. \u00ad\u2013 that bona fide organizational members, usually in key positions, are FBI or police informers, guilty of such offenses as skimming organizational funds and the like. The purpose of this tactic was to \u2018isolate and eliminate\u2019 organizational leadership; such efforts were continued \u2013 and in some instances accelerated \u2013 when it became known that the likely outcome would be extreme violence visited upon the \u2018jacketed\u2019 individual(s). Bad-jacketing was a very commonly used technique.\u201d[6]<\/p> <p>Churchill went on to explain that \u201cjacketing\u201d people is \u201cwell known in prisons where guards are adept\u201d at playing prisoners against each other.<\/p> <p>Indiana\u2019s prisons present a particularly fertile environment for officials to snitch jacket prisoners. This is because the prison culture here is one where officials have successfully molded prisoners to think like them and have cultivated a value system where prisoners inherently distrust and compete with each other, but trust and look to win acceptance, favors and approval from the pigs. The Willie Lynch mentality and peer suspicion is deeply rooted in the culture.<\/p> <p>The prisoners are mentally softened up to not think critically or seek unity among themselves, by the prevalence of officially facilitated addiction and petty materialism and the uncritical practice of prisoners habitually gossiping, rumormongering, prying into others\u2019 personal affairs and readily discussing personal things and engaging in \u201cfriendly\u201d banter with the pigs \u2013 a total reversal of the old prison and political culture of decades past.<\/p> <p>An informant culture prevails where the prisoners openly give information to officials and spread misinformation generated by them.<\/p> <p>In any case, in Indiana, my political work and writings have continued, alongside my having previously unavailable access to communicate with outside people using the phone via tablets we have use of inside our cells throughout the day. I have therefore been able to contribute more directly to the outside work of others and organizations I support and cofounded. I continue to experience the range of repressions and remain undeterred as ever.<\/p> <p>These have been the conditions I have experienced and contended with, and which prompted my ongoing domestic exile \u2013 being bounced from state to state \u2013 over the past nine years. Political oppression and COINTELPRO are alive and well in Amerika.<\/p> <p>Specific accounts of the conditions I experienced and witnessed over these years can be read in the many articles on my website, which are separated according to each state system I have been imprisoned in \u2013 see rashidmod.com.<\/p> <p>Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win!

In Hanau, German and Turkish flags flew at half-staff outside a mosque where worshipers were gathering Friday.<\/p> <p>A 43-year-old German man fatally shot nine people with immigrant backgrounds in the Frankfurt suburb late Wednesday before apparently killing his 72-year-old mother and himself. Half of the victims were reported to be Turkish.<\/p> <p>The man, identified as Tobias Rathjen, left a number of rambling texts and videos espousing racist views and claiming to have been under surveillance since birth.<\/p> <p>More than 300 people attended prayers at the Turkish-speaking DITIB mosque attended by at least one of the victims. \u201cThe mood is subdued,\u201d said Adam Arslan, who was friends with Gokhan Gultekin, who died in the attack. \u201cI cannot accept this crime.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cMay our almighty God rest the souls of our brethren who lost their lives in Wednesday\u2019s heinous racist attack,\u201d Fevzi Hoguk, the imam, or prayer leader, told the congregation.<\/p> <p>Mosques opened their doors to journalists who have swarmed into Hanau after the attack \u2014 not the usual practice in privacy-obsessed Germany. A half-dozen TV cameras plus photographers and journalists mingled freely with the congregation before and after Friday prayers.<\/p> <p>The chairman of the mosque board, Memduh Onder, said the community was not afraid, \u201cbecause we are together,\u201d citing the memorial gathering in front of city hall Thursday evening where German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke. \u201cThe thousands of people on the square, most of them were German,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, officials confirmed they had received a letter from the suspect last November in which he sought help from authorities in stopping the surveillance he believed he was under. The letter didn\u2019t ring any alarm bells with prosecutors, officials said.<\/p> <p>Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said state-level security officials and security agencies he consulted Thursday agreed to increase the law enforcement presence around the country. Seehofer said there would be more surveillance at \u201csensitive sites,\u201d including mosques, and a high police presence at railway stations, airports and borders.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe threat posed by far-right extremism, anti-Semitism and racism is very high in Germany,\u201d Seehofer told reporters in Berlin.<\/p> <p>Thousands of people gathered in cities across Germany on Thursday evening to hold vigils for the shooting victims but also to express anger that authorities haven\u2019t done enough to prevent attacks despite a string of incidents in recent years. Last week, authorities arrested 12 men \u2014 including a police employee \u2014 on suspicion of planning attacks on Muslims and politicians.<\/p> <p>Some have also called for a crackdown on the extremist and anti-migrant ideology that has crept into mainstream political debate with the rise of the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD.<\/p> <p>A top official in the center-left Social Democratic Party, a junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s governing coalition, accused AfD of providing ideological fodder to people like the Hanau shooter.<\/p> <p>\u201cOne person carried out the shooting in Hanau, that\u2019s what it looks like, but there were many that supplied him with ammunition, and AfD definitely belongs to them,\u201d Lars Klingbeil told German public broadcaster ARD on Friday.<\/p> <p>Parts of Alternative for Germany already were under close scrutiny from Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency. The party has rejected all responsibility for far-right attacks, including an anti-Semitic attack on a synagogue and the killing of a regional politician last year.<\/p> <p>One key question in the investigation is whether authorities or others were aware the suspect posed a threat.<\/p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the points that\u2019s particularly interesting to me in this investigation,\u201d said Seehofer. \u201cWho knew what.\u201d<\/p> <p>Peter Frank, Germany\u2019s chief federal prosecutor, said the investigation would concentrate on the suspect\u2019s movements prior to the attack, and whether he had had contact with other people. The suspect\u2019s father was being questioned as a witness, he said.<\/p> <p>Frank acknowledged that his office had received a letter from the suspect three months ago. The letter didn\u2019t contain many of the more explicit racist and genocidal comments later found in the document posted on Rathjen\u2019s website and didn\u2019t prompt any action from prosecutors, Frank said.<\/p> <p>Seehofer noted that rules intended to ensure stricter background checks on gun owners came into force Thursday \u2014 a day after the attack \u2014 but that he was open to the idea of tightening the rules further.<\/p> <p>One hurdle to effective communication between different branches of government in Germany is the country\u2019s treasured notion of privacy \u2014 which grew out of the experiences with the Nazi police state and communist East Germany \u2014 along with the complex web of local, regional, state and federal authorities that might be involved in checking a person\u2019s suitability for gun ownership.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe will always respect data protection,\u201d said Seehofer. \u201cBut the discussion about data protection mustn\u2019t push aside the discussion about security in this country.\u201d<\/p> <p>___<\/p> <p>Jordans reported from Berlin.<\/p> <p>Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Marilyn Moore.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s a story reminiscent of the aftermath of an election 33 years ago. On Sept. 24, 1986, five Democratic workers were arrested and charged with illegally collecting and possessing absentee ballots, including Daniel Roach, now a top adviser to Mayor Joe Ganim and a longtime member of the city\u2019s Police Commission.<\/p> <p>Roach, then and now the Democratic leader for the city\u2019s Black Rock district, was a member of the city council at the time and the only elected official arrested. He took his case to trial, successfully fighting single charges of collecting and possessing an absentee ballot. During the 1988 court case where he was found innocent, a young lawyer named Joseph P. Ganim occasionally attended the trial in his support.<\/p> <p>At the time of his arrest, Roach called the charges \u201cridiculous.\u201d He was defended by Ganim\u2019s uncle, Raymond Ganim, and when evidence was presented, the chief witness against Roach couldn\u2019t tell the difference between an absentee ballot application and the actual ballot, which is illegal to handle.<\/p> <p>Roach on Saturday recalled that the trial witness testified it was someone else, not Roach, who handled the absentee ballot.<\/p> <p>The case underscored a bizarre chapter in the city\u2019s political history, in which a political pathfinder, state Sen. Margaret E. Morton, happened to see the campaign manager of her opponent stuff 45 absentee ballots into a mailbox on the sidewalk in front of the Middle Street post office on the morning of the Sept. 9 primary. Morton immediately called police, who seized the ballots and investigated.<\/p> <p>A subsequent probe by reporters on the two Bridgeport newspapers at the time, The Telegram and the Bridgeport Post, found that at least 17 voters said they gave their completed ballots to campaign workers for Morton\u2019s challenger, Laurayne Farrar-James, at the time a member of the city council, who died this year at 92. Reporters also found city records indicating a deceased voter cast an absentee ballot and also voted in person on that 1986 Primary Day.<\/p> <p>Those arrested included a city employee and two residents of the P.T. Barnum housing complex, including the vice president of the tenants\u2019 association. The four didn\u2019t fight the charges, and did not get prison terms. The campaign manager Morton saw with the absentee ballots \u2014 John J. McNamara, an attorney \u2014 apparently escaped prosecution, claiming that he deposited only office mail in the mailbox.<\/p> <p>At the time, police investigating the issue had seized only the ballots and let other mail through to get processed at the post office.<\/p> <p>While only 45 absentee ballots were the focus of that investigation, an anticipated state probe into the city\u2019s recent Sept. 10 primary between Moore and Ganim would likely center on the 1,280 absentees cast, 967 of which went to Ganim and 313 for Moore.<\/p> <p>Ganim won the election 5,304 to 5,034, according to Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who last week referred the Hearst Connecticut Media reports to the State Elections Enforcement Commission, which is expected on Monday to launch its own probe into the allegations of irregularities.<\/p> <p>Morton was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1972, at age 48. Eight years later, she became the first African American woman to serve in the state Senate. She retired in 1992 and died in 2012 at 87. In 2012, the City Hall Annex, which houses several city departments, including the registrars\u2019 and mayor\u2019s offices, was named in her honor.<\/p> <p>Nowadays, the contraction of the U.S. Postal Service has ended same-day delivery within the city of Bridgeport. Mail taken to the Bridgeport post office gets sent to Westchester County, N.Y., for processing, often taking three days to forward a letter mailed in Bridgeport, back to the recipient in Bridgeport.<\/p> <p>Roach took out 10 absentee ballot applications for the primary, according to city records. He said they were for elderly neighbors of his in Black Rock.<\/p> <p>kdixon@ctpost.com Twitter: @KenDixonCT<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":2,"HIT_id":"31JUPBOORPJRA9HW2DMJCQNL579L8Y"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":1836,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Margaret E.

Maxwell, a former socialite and a daughter of the British media mogul Robert Maxwell, who maintained her innocence throughout the trial, was convicted of five of the six charges of which she was accused, and faces up to sixty-five years behind bars. (Judge Alison J. Nathan, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, has yet to set a date for her sentencing.) When the jury announced its verdict, Maxwell, who was wearing a black mask and dark clothing, sat very still. According to the Times, she took a sip of water and touched her face briefly, before being ushered out of the courtroom. At no point did she betray any emotion.<\/p> <p>For those of us who have been following United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, the defendant\u2019s sangfroid didn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. The trial opened this past November, in Manhattan federal court, more than two years after Epstein, the disgraced financier, was found hanging in his jail cell, where he was awaiting his own trial for allegedly coercing dozens of young women and teen-age girls into sexual acts. In the course of Maxwell\u2019s trial, which was widely seen as a last chance at justice for Epstein\u2019s victims, four women\u2014who were all under the age of eighteen when they first met the pair\u2014testified to Epstein\u2019s sex crimes, which were facilitated by Maxwell, and their words were often harrowing. (\u201cShe has caused hurt to many more women than the few of us who had the chance to testify in the courtroom,\u201d one victim said.) And yet, aside from occasionally consulting with her legal team and taking notes, Maxwell remained sphinxlike throughout the trial, expressing no frailty and certainly no regret. One can only assume that this stance did not win her very many points with the jury.<\/p> <p>Maxwell\u2019s brand of chilly hauteur was on full display, early on, when the socialite, who was being drawn by a courtroom sketch artist, began to sketch the artist back\u2014an act which, in its attempt to reverse the roles, smacked of a certain derision for the gravity of the proceedings around her. The moment, which became something of an Internet meme in the days that followed, also reminded me of Maxwell\u2019s brazen gaze when she was photographed at\u2014or arguably Photoshopped into a picture of\u2014a Los Angeles-area In-N-Out Burger, soon after Epstein\u2019s death. This was a woman who has long acted, and has continued to act, as if she had absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. (Her lead attorney has said that her team is already working on an appeal of the verdict.) When given a chance to explain her side of things, in court, Maxwell declined to take the stand, stating that \u201cthe government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and so there is no need for me to testify.\u201d<\/p> <p>The government\u2019s case, however, was damning. As Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe noted in her closing argument, Maxwell \u201cran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls,\u201d preying on teens who often came from difficult family situations by reassuring them with her presence, acting the part of the \u201cposh, smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman.\u201d (Judging from the stories the victims told on the stand, it seems that Maxwell was able to tone down her arrogant stonewalling when she wanted to.) She offered the girls money and gifts, such as Victoria\u2019s Secret underwear, in return for them giving Epstein \u201cmassages,\u201d which were merely a smoke screen for sexual abuse. One victim, testifying under the pseudonym Jane, told the court that, beginning when she was fourteen, Maxwell not only made her feel more comfortable with the increasingly sexualized atmosphere in Epstein\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but also actively participated in her abuse. \u201cShe, along with others, would just start taking their clothes off,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAnd Jeffrey would get on the massage table, and it would just, you know, sort of turn into this orgy.\u201d<\/p> <p>A second victim, testifying under the pseudonym Kate, told the court that when she was seventeen, Maxwell recruited her, under the guise of a friendly favor, to give Epstein a massage, which led to Kate being sexually abused for the next several years. (\u201cShe asked me if I had fun and told me that I was such a good girl, and that I was one of his favorites,\u201d Kate said, of Maxwell.) A third woman, who testified under her first name, Carolyn, recounted how, starting at the age of fourteen and continuing until she was eighteen, she would come to Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach estate two or three times a week to give him sexualized massages\u2014appointments that were often scheduled by Maxwell, who would then be present to greet Carolyn on her arrival. On one occasion, Maxwell entered the massage room where Carolyn was standing in the nude: \u201cShe came in and felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said that . . . I had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends,\u201d Carolyn testified. She also said that when she confessed to Maxwell that her own grandfather had begun raping her when she was four years old, this revelation didn\u2019t seem to deter Maxwell and Epstein from continuing to abuse her. A fourth woman, Annie Farmer\u2014the only victim who testified under her own full name\u2014spoke of Maxwell\u2019s grooming methods: the socialite bought Farmer, who was sixteen at the time, cowboy boots and engaged her in amiable conversation, and later gave her a sexualized massage at Epstein\u2019s ranch in New Mexico.<\/p> <p>Officially, Maxwell was in charge of managing Epstein\u2019s various properties, overseeing tasks from the mundane to the whimsical: Cimberly Espinosa, a former assistant of Maxwell\u2019s at the Epstein office who appeared as a witness for the defense, recalled that, after the financier purchased his Caribbean island, Little Saint James, he was unsatisfied with the amount of sand and palm trees on the premises, and deputized Maxwell to deliver more of both. Both Espinosa and another onetime Epstein office employee, Michelle Healy, who also served as a defense witness, praised Maxwell\u2019s managerial abilities. Maxwell was \u201cfantastic,\u201d Healy said. \u201cShe taught me a lot. I respected her. She was tough. But she was great.\u201d Espinosa said that she \u201clearned a lot from her as far as administrative and being able to handle a lot of calls, a lot of duties. It was a very high-volume work.\u201d (Both witnesses denied involvement in any wrongdoing.)<\/p> <p>As I followed these testimonies to Maxwell\u2019s on-the-ball competence, it struck me that the same acumen that she used in her aboveboard professional life served her just as well in her more private role: that of making sure there was a constant stream of mostly underage girls to fulfill Epstein\u2019s voracious, monstrous sexual appetite. Maxwell\u2019s real job \u201cwas to take care of Jeffrey\u2019s needs,\u201d Kate noted, in her testimony. \u201cShe said that he needed massages all the time and it was very difficult to keep up.\u201d Later, she added that Maxwell would ask her if she \u201cknew anybody who could come and give Jeffrey a blow job because . . . it was a lot for her to do.\u201d The jokiness of the question concealed a steely discipline. In the household manual Maxwell distributed to employees at Epstein\u2019s properties, she \u201cwrote out a detailed list of thirteen different oils and lotions for massages in Palm Beach,\u201d Moe said, while in the phone book that Maxwell shared with Epstein, she kept a running list of dozens of available masseuses, some of them accompanied with notations such as \u201cmom,\u201d \u201cdad,\u201d or \u201cparents,\u201d suggesting that these were not professional bodyworkers but amateur minors. In his testimony for the prosecution, Juan Alessi, who was in charge of managing Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach house, was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey about Maxwell\u2019s household manual. From cleaning instructions to meal-serving etiquette and privacy concerns\u2014\u201cremember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing,\u201d the manual read\u2014Maxwell had \u201cmany, many, many rules,\u201d Alessi said. Comey asked Alessi if he had seen any females coming into Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach house in the years he worked there. \u201cMany, many, many females,\u201d he responded.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":2,"HIT_id":"3UQ1LLR26CN5TXABZB6X8HTGVV9LA2"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":2786,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kate","victim_keywords":"sex trafficking, rape, Epstein","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"sex trafficking, rape, Epstein","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kate","victim_keywords":"sex trafficking, rape, Epstein","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"sex trafficking, rape, Epstein","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":891806000,"Input.title":"Sowore: CISLAC tackles Presidency over comment on 100, 000 Nigerians","Input.publish_date":"2019-12-09 14:21:47+01:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Nicholas Kalu, Abuja<\/p> <p>The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) has tackled the Special Adviser to the President On Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, over comments in the media that the outrage over Omoyele Sowore\u2019s re-arrest last week was from less than 100, 000 Nigerians.<\/p> <p>Adesina, who was on Channels Televisions Sunrise Daily on Monday, reacting to a question that a lot of Nigerians seemed enraged over development had disagreed saying all the \u201cnoise\u201d over the situation was coming from less than 100, 000 out of 198 million Nigerians.<\/p> <p>Executive Director of CISLAC, Auwal Ibrahim Musa, reacting to this in a chat with The Nation, said that such a statement was unfortunate and should be withdrawn immediately and an apology made to Nigerians.<\/p> <p>Musa said, \u201cIt is a very unfortunate situation because if the government does not care its citizens, then it shows how irresponsible they are.

In studies with severe infection, there was a 75 percent reduction in mortality in ivermectin users.<\/p> <p>But instead of promoting something that seemed to be showing a lot of success, the government with the help of a non-governmental organization that collaborated with the WHO, influenced the conclusion of the studies involving ivermectin.<\/p> <p>In the U.S., the use of ivermectin can take away a doctor\u2019s license. It has become a sort of flashpoint in people\u2019s lives, and the government wants them to agree to defer using it as treatment, essentially destroying ivermectin.

create more potentially fatal encounters with police<\/p> <p>Cameras already keep watch over parts of York, according to the city's mayor, but they are mostly limited to the downtown area \u2014 which creates a \"biased\" surveillance system.<\/p> <p>That's one reason why Mayor Michael Helfrich supports a citywide network of cameras that would cover \"high-crime areas,\" he told those attending a Tuesday night forum held to gauge interest in the proposed surveillance network.<\/p> <p>But all that would do, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania countered, is create a police state that would increase the possibility of deadly encounters between law enforcement and the city's minority communities.<\/p> <p>Public opinion has so far been mixed on whether installing cameras throughout the city is the right fit for York.<\/p> <p>\u201cI would like to see some equity so people in neighborhoods where more crime is occurring have more protection,\" Helfrich said at Tuesday's

City's minorities<\/p> <p>He noted there currently are surveillance cameras in the city that are owned by individual local businesses and are almost solely focused on downtown.<\/p> <p>There are very few cameras outside the downtown area, which he said creates a \"biased camera system\" that largely ignores other neighborhoods.<\/p> <p>Under the proposed surveillance network, a nonprofit organization would be tasked with raising funds to buy and maintain video cameras in the city.<\/p> <p>If adopted, York officials have said, the system would be based on the work of the Lancaster Safety Coalition, a nonprofit organization that runs a network of 170 cameras in Lancaster City.<\/p> <p>The concept is not to have the police conduct surveillance during all hours of the day but rather to have citizens view footage, then notify police if they see activity deemed suspicious.<\/p> <p>The ACLU, though, said expanding surveillance would do nothing but target the city's minority communities.<\/p> <p>\"Increasing surveillance and encouraging more police interactions that far too often turn deadly isn't a measure of equity, it's a measure of the expansion of the police state; a police state that disproportionately impacts Black and brown people,\" Alex Domingos, organizer for the ACLU's Campaign for Smart Justice, said in a statement issued Wednesday.<\/p> <p>Richard Craighead, president of the York NAACP, did not respond to requests for comment.

Alaa did not take part in those protests, yet he was still arrested.

Intensified contact listing and isolation-(92 per cent of all contacts have been identified).<\/p> <p>\u201cIncreased laboratories by 100 per cent \u2013 (Lagos -3; Abuja-2; Irua-1; Ibadan UCH-1; Iree-1; Jos-1; Kano-1; Abakaliki-1), there are now 11 laboratories in the network.<\/p> <p>\u201cIncreased testing by 50 per cent, to the current capacity of 1,500 tests per day, with over 6,000 tests done. Procurement concluded for new high throughput testing by end of the month.<\/p> <p>\u201cDistributed Personal Protective Equipment to over 40,000 healthcare workers \u2013 there have been no stock outs. Trained over 7,000 Healthcare workers on infection prevention and control. Deployed NCDC teams to 19 states. Visited Lagos to evaluate the readiness.<\/p> <p>\u201cDespite all of these, the PTF is convinced that we must deliver more. We have also been assessing the impact of the lockdown and the level of compliance by Nigerians.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhile we recognize the difficulties associated with such unprecedented action, we remain certain, however, that it is a step in the right direction for us to secure a healthier tomorrow.<\/p> <p>\u201cBased on the evaluation of experts, assessment of available data and experiences of other nations currently in the same situation, the PTF has submitted its recommendations to Mr. President and I urge Nigerians to please await further pronouncements in this regard.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe PTF continues to appeal to all Nigerians to remain calm, maintain personal hygiene, observe physical distancing and stay at home\u201d, he said.<\/p> <p>The Federal Government also recommended the use of face masks by Nigerians in order to reduce their susceptibility to infection by the novel Coronavirus.<\/p> <p>According to the government, Nigerians do not have to resort to using \u2018medical-grade\u2019 or surgical masks which are normally discarded after four hours of usage, advising that homemade masks which are cheap and reusable would serve the same purpose.<\/p> <p>The Health Minister, Dr Osagie Ehanire, said the usage of mask was not compulsory, but only a recommendation by the task force.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe said we are recommending. We are not saying it is compulsory, we are recommending. Secondly, we also said that, it does not have to be hospital-grade mask. It does not have to be medical or surgical-grade. You can make your own and preferably, your mask can be washable. You can wash it and iron it and reuse.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe ones many of us are using here now are single-use which you have to throw away but you do not need that for day to day activities and the purpose of that mask is to shield you and shield your opposite because if anyone is emitting any kind of droplet or particles by way of coughing or sneezing or when people are shouting, laughing or exclaiming, you can capture them through the barrier.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt can even be a scarf you tie across your mouth so that you do not run the risk of transmitting it to someone else. That is why we said it must be washed every evening, preferably in warm water and then dried and ironed. If you do that, you are safe to reuse it the next day. We are making that recommendation and also particularly stretching it to food vendors in the interest of their customers\u201d, he said.<\/p> <p>The National Coordinator of the Task Force, Dr Sani Aliyu, on his part, said newly-opened laboratories in the country are currently underutilized.<\/p> <p>According to him; \u201cOn the issue of testing, I know there has been a lot in the Press recently. Part of the reason why we have not proceeded as fast as we can is because of the demand as well. We are not having as much demand for testing in those laboratories that we have activated and I am asking those laboratories particularly the ones that were activated in the last few days to please put forward processes that will allow them to key in, particularly in areas where there are suspicions of people having COVID-19.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis does not only include people who have had contact or those who have travelled abroad. It also includes persons with unusual respiratory tract infections, particularly severe respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization and I will ask that those laboratories that we have activated in the last one week should widen their scope when it comes to selection of testing based on our protocols so that we can have more positives identified and isolated.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is no room for massive community testing for Coronavirus. I would rather do a hundred tests and get 10 positives rather than do 1, 000 tests and get 10 positives. It is all a out improving the efficiency of the tests. It is better to test persons that have symptoms because what we call the pre-test probability is higher.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen we talk about incubation period, this is the period between when you get an infection and the time the symptoms happen. And the incubation period is when the virus multiplies in the body and it is not excreted. If you are in the incubation period, you will not be excreting the virus and the test is looking for the presence of the virus.<\/p> <p>\u201cTherefore, if you do the test during the incubation period which may range from between two, three days to 14 days, the test will be negative. In other words, you could still be in an incubation period and it will give you a false assurance that everything is alright. That is why we do not recommend doing the tests in the absence of symptoms.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe reason why in some cases some people might be asymptomatic and still have a positive result, which is extremely rare, is because a lot of people might have mild symptoms that you will not even notice. This is why we need to do the test at the right time in order to pick up the virus.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo, we are not going to start doing massive testing in the communities. It will be inefficient, it will be expensive and it is not going to help us increase the number of positives\u201d, he explained.<\/p> <p>In his remarks, the Aviation Minister, Senator Hadi Sirika, who spoke on the face-off between the ministry and the Rivers State Government, said the Federal Government was currently dialoguing with the state government to effect the release of two pilots of Caverton Helicopters who were last week arrested and remanded at a state facility in Port Harcourt for breaching an Executive Order made by the state Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":2,"HIT_id":"3HYV4299H2BD4374LRZFZVX1WA8E84"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":601,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Coronavirus lockdown","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Coronavirus lockdown","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1030705242,"Input.title":"Osun 2022: Political parties charged to scrutinize aspirants","Input.publish_date":"2022-02-27 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Ahead of the July 16, 2022, Osun gubernatorial election, all the participating political parties have been charged to scrutinize individuals to be presented as candidates.<\/p> <p>This charge was handed down by Wasiu Oyedokun Alli, Group Executive Director, The Osun Masterminds, a socio-political group, while interacting with journalists in Osogbo on Saturday.<\/p> <p>Alli, who said governance in Osun State was beyond the theatrics of archaic politicking, singing and dancing, added that it should be more about debate of ideas.<\/p> <p>Acknowledging that leadership in the 22nd century is about wholesome sustainable development and not petty socialism, Alli said The Osun Masterminds was against entrenching politics of stomach infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The group noted that candidates for political offices must be considered on the strength of their mental and leadership capacities.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe also must note that the era of rice and beans politics should rightly be over and must not be re-entrenched.<\/p> <p>\u201cCandidates must be considered on the strength of their mental and leadership capacities, and not by the amount of bags of rice that they have distributed.

However, while this decision was focused on his health, these hearings are really about what the Assange case has always been about: the United States\u2019 determination to silence anyone who exposes the crimes of the US empire.<\/p> <p>Leading press freedom and human rights organizations have been clear about the implications of a potential Assange extradition and have called on President Biden to drop the case. If there were still any doubts that the Department of Justice\u2019s focus on Assange was corrupt and politically motivated, those who remain skeptical should consider two major revelations about the US campaign against Assange since the last hearing.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year the Icelandic news outlet Stundin reported that a key witness in the prosecution against Assange admitted to lying in his indictment. This witness was Sigurdur Ingi Thordarson, a convicted pedophile and fraudster. The FBI promised Thordarson immunity from prosecution under the condition that he lie about his relationship with WikiLeaks in an indictment which would strengthen the DOJ\u2019s conspiracy charge against Assange. Along with the debunked claim that Assange pressured whistleblower Chelsea Manning into hacking a US government computer, Thordarson\u2019s indictment was supposed to paint Assange as having a pattern of pressuring sources to commit cyber crimes. The Stundin article should put to rest any belief that the United States is being honest about its stated reasons for going after Assange.<\/p> <p>But the Stundin article is not even the most concerning glimpse into the prosecution\u2019s true character. Just this month, Yahoo News reported that Mike Pompeo, the main force behind Trump\u2019s decision to pursue extradition, was obsessed with punishing Assange for publishing the Vault 7 documents which revealed the CIA\u2019s activities of electronic surveillance and cyber-warfare. Though The Grayzone initially broke this news in May 2020, the recent Yahoo News report includes additional details of Pompeo\u2019s obsession. Most shockingly, Pompeo held such a vendetta against Assange that he considered arranging a shoot-out in the streets of London with the British government to assassinate Assange.<\/p> <p>It is still unclear if either of these facts will be considered in the UK court\u2019s upcoming hearings. There remains a dangerous lack of solidarity with Assange from the press, which is exactly why it is so important that this extradition not happen. As mainstream news outlets become increasingly complacent, and even supportive of pro-war policies, it becomes more essential that anti-war voices, and anti-war journalists in particular, resist the attempt by the United States to set the precedent that the act of publishing war crimes is a punishable offense.<\/p> <p>After 20 years of the United States military destroying entire countries under the guise of fighting terrorism, there is finally a partial reckoning with US warmongering around the world. It cannot be said that Americans are particularly anti-war now, but at the very least, Biden\u2019s decision to pull US troops from Afghanistan was widely popular across the political spectrum. Yet, many news outlets instead chose to emphasize the minority position on Afghanistan by prioritizing commentary from interventionists and weapons lobbyists over anti-war scholars and activists, and by falsely representing the US occupation of Afghanistan as a positive. This sudden emphasis on the supposedly positive role of US occupation in Afghanistan is a particularly dangerous line for journalists to push considering how little effort the US media placed on covering the conflict prior to withdrawal. One study found that in 2020, three major news outlets gave the conflict a combined coverage of less than five minutes.<\/p> <p>In contrast to publications that take such a careless or outright supportive stance on the irreparable harm of US foreign policy are WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. Following his view that \"if wars can be started with lies, they can be stopped by truth,\" Assange has published some of the most vital information on US foreign policy of the 21st century with perfect accuracy. Some of the information provided to the public (thanks to the anonymous online source submission system developed by Assange) includes the CIA rendition program, detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay, and US war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and more. It is this view on publishing which understands war as something to be exposed and resisted that has made Assange such a hated figure by warmongers in the United States.<\/p> <p>However, as every Assange supporter knows, a potential extradition of Assange will not just stop with Assange. The fear is that the torture he has endured and a possible extradition and even sentencing under the Espionage Act would enable the US government to do the same to anyone else who exposes the crimes of the US military. Even if the United States cannot successfully imprison every journalist who exposes its crimes, such a precedent would likely scare publications into even greater submission to the state. The desired outcome is the complete neutering of anti-war journalism.<\/p> <p>Despite the many problems with the mainstream press, journalism as an institution remains one of the most effective methods of resisting, and at times, ending wars. Even those distrustful of the press should be willing to oppose attacks on the right to a free press when such attacks occur. It is the guarantee of press freedom that enables anti-war reporting to make its way into the mainstream at times, shifting people\u2019s understanding of what their government does.<\/p> <p>One recent example of the power of the press is the reporting that the New York Times and Washington Post did on the US military\u2019s drone strike of an Afghan aid worker, Zemari Ahmadi, and his family. Though these two publications are often the principal cheerleaders of US foreign policy, their recent independent investigations into Biden\u2019s drone strike brought the US drone program to the attention of the American public. As a result, the Pentagon had to admit it not only killed a civilian and his loved ones, but knowingly lied to the public by falsely claiming they had proof that this man was an ISIS-K operative. That admission of guilt and dishonesty may not have come if not for the power that the reporters at the Times and the Post chose to wield over the warmongers in the Pentagon.<\/p> <p>One has to wonder: if these publications chose to routinely use their immense resources and platforms to scrutinize the military, rather than provide PR for it, would the drone program even still be operating? Would the war in Afghanistan have ended much sooner? Could the invasion have been avoided entirely?<\/p> <p>These are questions that cannot be answered, but they should be asked of journalists as the US continues to prioritize military spending and beat the drum for a new war with China. The press still has the power to challenge and prevent US wars. However, this power hangs in the balance in the form of Julian Assange\u2019s fate. Recent coverage of the Afghanistan withdrawal shows the potential for two types of press. One which sees its role as the mouthpiece for the most war-hungry members of a global empire or one that shows the true nature of war to the public, enabling them to oppose it and giving its victims some justice. For anti-war advocates who would rather see the latter option covering foreign policy, it is essential to show strong support for Julian Assange and demand the charges against him be dropped immediately.<\/p> <p>Sam Carliner is a journalist based in New Jersey.

Mongolia\u2019s officials insisted then, in 2016, that the visit was strictly religious, and had nothing to do with politics: The country has connections to Tibetan Buddhism that reach back hundreds of years\u2014the title \u201cDalai Lama\u201d is actually of Mongolian origin. Of course, that mattered little to China, which views the octogenarian spiritual leader as a separatist.<\/p> <p>Beijing promptly canceled meetings with its Mongolian counterparts and slapped fees on commodity imports from Mongolia, which was already suffering from an economic downturn. A month later, the Mongolian government said the Dalai Lama was no longer welcome. He has not returned since.<\/p> <p>Tsakhia Elbegdorj, Mongolia\u2019s president at the time, told me recently that the decision was, as was widely assumed, due to \u201cpressure from the south,\u201d a reference to China, with which Mongolia shares a border. Elbegdorj has an outsize role in modern Mongolian politics: He served two terms as the country\u2019s president, from 2009 to 2017, and prior to that, two terms as prime minister. He was one of the leaders of the 1990 democratic revolution that peacefully ended seven decades of Mongolia\u2019s serving as a Soviet satellite state. Given his country\u2019s location, hemmed in by Russia and China\u2014two countries that \u201creally don\u2019t like our way of life,\u201d as Elbegdorj put it\u2014and its economic dependence on Beijing, he has spent much of his political life interacting with the highest levels of the Chinese government. By his count, he has met Chinese President Xi Jinping some 30 times. In 2015, Xi hailed China-Mongolia relations as the \u201cbest ever.\u201d<\/p> <p>Now a harsh and high-profile critic of Beijing\u2019s recent efforts to stamp out the Mongolian language and its distinctive, vertical script in Inner Mongolia, an ostensibly autonomous region within China that is distinct from Mongolia, Elbegdorj and his country offer an extreme example of the difficulties facing nations that are heavily reliant on Beijing. Those challenges are amplified for places such as Mongolia\u2014democracies that profess even limited support for human rights. China\u2019s economic and military power allow it to demand uncomfortable concessions, and as the country becomes more and more antagonistic, its less powerful neighbors are left with little room for maneuver. How, then, does a smaller nation choose between its values and its interests?<\/p> <p>\u201cOf course, when you are in office, you have certain responsibilities,\u201d Elbegdorj told me in one of two recent interviews, struggling at times to square his current vocal denunciations of Chinese policies with his more muted tone when he occupied the highest echelons of government. \u201cBut when you are out of office, you also have more freedom to express your ideas.\u201d When I asked him whether he still believed, as his foreign minister said four years ago, that the Dalai Lama should be barred from visiting, he was briefly evasive, before relenting, \u201cI\u2019ll say it publicly now: We are always happy to see his holiness in Mongolia.\u201d<\/p> <p>When Elbegdorj, a journalist turned democracy advocate, became president in 2009, the country was becoming one of superlatives. It was, briefly, the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, powered largely by mineral wealth, housing the world\u2019s best-performing stock exchange, located in what is often referred to as the coldest capital city in the world. Prospectors, geologists, heavy-equipment operators, and a stream of carpetbaggers of all varieties arrived from Australia, the U.S., and Europe. The boom brought flashes of wealth to Soviet-influenced Ulaanbaatar: Ostentatiously kitted out Hummers idled in traffic, inching past the softly lit glass front of a Louis Vuitton store. The city\u2019s last statue of Vladimir Lenin came down in 2012. (The boom would prove short-lived\u2014by 2017, the country needed a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.)<\/p> <p>While he upgraded relations with China, Elbegdorj also worked to bring Mongolia to a more prominent position on the international stage, involving it more heavily in the United Nations and other multinational groups. (He had a moment of viral stardom when former President Barack Obama inadvertently obscured his face during a 2011 photo op.) He pushed for the abolition of the death penalty, which, when it occurred in 2015, brought praise from human-rights groups. President-elect Joe Biden in 2011 hailed Mongolia under Elbegdorj as an \u201cemerging leader in the worldwide democratic movement.\u201d The enthusiasm was tempered a year later, though, when Elbegdorj faced U.S. and UN criticism for the jailing of a former president.<\/p> <p>But praise from the West for democratic progress cannot make up for uncomfortable geography. \u201cMongolia\u2019s strong economic dependence on China is worrisome,\u201d Oyunsuren Damdinsuren, a senior lecturer at the National University of Mongolia\u2019s School of International Relations and Public Administration, told me. \u201cIf China decides not to buy Mongolian products, our economy will be paralyzed.\u201d This power imbalance has helped fuel broad anti-Chinese sentiment among Mongolia\u2019s population, aided by a history of \u201c200 years of Manchu rule, 70 years of anti-China communist propaganda, and 30 years of China-bashing electoral campaigns,\u201d Damdinsuren said.<\/p> <p>Read: What happens when China leads the world<\/p> <p>The Dalai Lama\u2019s visit was not Elbegdorj\u2019s first, or only, China-related controversy. Two years earlier, in 2014, his country\u2019s officials stopped two Mongol-rights advocates from Inner Mongolia who had made their way across the border and were reportedly seeking exile. The pair were sent back to China, and what has happened to them since is unclear. Elbegdorj took both domestic and foreign criticism for the move at the time, and, indeed, still does. He now calls the incident an \u201cunfortunate mistake,\u201d but claims that the decision was made without his input. He added that Mongolia\u2019s current government, led by a populist political rival, should take a stronger stand and allow Inner Mongolians to seek refuge. \u201cI\u2019m openly saying to our government, \u2018Don\u2019t give those people back to China,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cThey should be granted refugee status.\u201d<\/p> <p>Unbounded by elected office, in recent months Elbegdorj has emerged as one of the most consistent and highest-profile critics of Beijing\u2019s attempts to curb Mongolian language and culture both within its own borders and internationally. During our conversations, he repeatedly said that his outspokenness was not caused by a sudden shift in his thinking\u2014though he acknowledged that there is a distinct challenge in the diplomatic balancing act required to run a country so dependent on China.<\/p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t change,\u201d he said when pressed on these seeming contradictions. \u201cMy standing\u2014to keep and continue to protect Mongolian identity, language, culture, and script\u2014since I entered public life, it remains the same.\u201d Rather, he told me, \u201cthe Chinese actually changed,\u201d and he noted what he called a \u201cvery aggressive\u201d assimilation policy being undertaken by the authorities in Inner Mongolia.<\/p> <p>Young women in Mongolian ceremonial clothing watched over by Chinese police at opening ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. (James Whitlow Delano \/ Redux)<\/p> <p>The full scope of these efforts came to light in September, when China started transitioning students in Inner Mongolia to using state-compiled textbooks and changing the language of lessons from Mongolian to Mandarin Chinese. The situation drew speculation that the Mongols of Inner Mongolia would soon be treated like minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, two regions where China has gone to extraordinary lengths to assimilate ethnic Tibetan and Uighur populations with the national Han Chinese majority.<\/p> <p>Beijing has responded to criticism of its Inner Mongolia policy with predictable furor. Chinese officials have singled out Elbegdorj, deploying a familiar tactic of accusing him of meddling in its internal affairs. He disagrees with the assessment. \u201cThis is not a foreign issue,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt is an issue related with my language; it is an issue related with my culture; it is an issue related with my tradition. Mongolians who live in Inner Mongolia, Mongolians who live in Mongolia, they are the same people, the same blood, the same traditions, the same history.\u201d (Elbegdorj\u2019s activism has, so far, been confined to Mongolia, a decision over which he has little say: He is facing a corruption probe and has been barred from leaving the country for the past few months, he told me. He denies the charges and said the investigation was politically motivated.)<\/p> <p>Read: The end of Hong Kong<\/p> <p>Mongols make up about 17 percent of the population of Inner Mongolia. The group has sometimes been described as a \u201cmodel minority\u201d within China. Though notable flare-ups have occurred, Mongolian nationalists have not been as openly radical as Uighurs and Tibetans, and Beijing\u2019s repression there is not nearly as severe as in Xinjiang or Tibet, according to Christopher P. Atwood, a professor of East Asian languages and civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. Society and culture within Inner Mongolia \u201cremains \u2018legible\u2019 to Han Chinese in a way that Uyghur and Tibetan society and culture, seen through the lenses of Islamophobia and secularist discourses about \u2018primitive superstition\u2019, has not been,\u201d Atwood recently wrote.<\/p> <p>Beijing has also generally taken a soft approach to Mongolia, never muscling in, for example, on a major mining project. Julian Dierkes, an associate public-policy professor at the University of British Columbia who is an expert on Mongolia, has long argued that this dynamic is due in part to nervousness about China\u2019s sizable domestic Mongolian community and the potential for ethnic conflict. There \u201chas always been this implicit concern or threat around having a large minority population that actually has a country outside to which it refers, unlike Uighurs and unlike Tibetans,\u201d he told me. Elbegdorj similarly described the Mongols of Inner Mongolia as a \u201cliving wall\u201d protecting Mongolia from China.<\/p> <p>These factors made it more alarming when, in July, initial reports of the education reforms began to surface. As the start of a new school year drew near, petitions against the move circulated on Chinese social media, and a number of popular bands backed calls for the decision to be reversed. Students and their parents staged large protests. China\u2019s response was swift: According to human-rights groups, the authorities carried out numerous arrests, harassed journalists, censored social media, and sacked academics who spoke out.<\/p> <p>In a September letter delivered to the Chinese embassy in Ulaanbaatar and addressed to Xi, Elbegdorj opened with a stinging line: \u201cYou, perhaps, have heard and are aware of the fundamental provision in the Constitution of your country that states \u2018All nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages\u2019 which is now being flagrantly infringed upon with respect to the Mongolian children of Inner Mongolia.\u201d The Chinese ambassador was incensed, dismissing Elbegdorj\u2019s claims as baseless hype, and the letter was promptly returned. Elbegdorj told me a few weeks before we spoke that his brother had received a menacing phone call warning him that Elbegdorj should stop his advocacy and keep quiet. The call, he said, came from a Chinese phone number.<\/p> <p>China has not confined its efforts to erase Mongolian identity to its own borders. Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne, a medieval castle in Nantes, France, houses a natural-history museum that was until recently preparing to host an exhibition on the 13th-century Mongol emperor Genghis Khan, organized in collaboration with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot, China. As preparations progressed, however, Chinese officials began asking that words such as empire, Mongol, and even the name Genghis Khan be removed from the exhibit, the museum director, Bertrand Guillet, wrote in a statement. They then went further, demanding that the exhibition synopsis be rewritten by Beijing. The text that emerged was \u201caimed at making Mongolian history and culture completely disappear for the benefit of a new national story,\u201d according to Guillet. He finally postponed the exhibit, \"in the name of the human, scientific and ethical values defended by the institution.\u201d It will open at a later date but with collections from Europe and America, rather than China.<\/p> <p>Mongolian politicians have been loath to speak out, likely worried by Beijing\u2019s reaction. The power imbalance was again made clear when China\u2019s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, visited Mongolia in September and was met by protesters angry over the actions in Inner Mongolia. Neither Wang nor Mongolia\u2019s current president made any public statement on the situation. But the Chinese ambassador, in an interview with a local newspaper, noted that China\u2019s demand for Mongolia\u2019s biggest export earner, coal, was falling. The implication was clear. \u201cFrankly,\u201d he was reported as saying, \u201cwe are working in your interests.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3MXX6RQ9EXKGIT9SI2PDCVG096G4PX"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":1804,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["enforced disappearance"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Inner Mongolia","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongol-rights activists","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongolian nationals, ethnic monorities, Chinese expansion","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["enforced disappearance"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Inner Mongolia","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongol-rights activists","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongolian nationals, ethnic monorities, Chinese expansion","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":898601579,"Input.title":"Proposal for total ban on deployment of Filipinos to Kuwait wins support","Input.publish_date":"2020-01-12 23:07:18","Input.article_interface":"<p>WhatsApp Facebook Twitter Email Messenger<\/p> <p>This post has been read 201096 times!<\/p> <p>\u2018Workers on holiday will be stranded\u2019<\/p> <p>Rev Fr Ben Barrameda officiates the requiem Mass for HSW Jeanelyn Villavenda organised by the FIL-ASEAK at the POLO-Kuwait.

On Tuesday, Binniyat was arraigned at the Barnawa Magistrate\u2019s Court in Kaduna state. He was charged with cyberstalking, a charge that critics say is often used in the African country to silence the media.<\/p> <p>On Nov. 4, Binniyat informed Epoch Times Africa Desk Editor Doug Burton that he was arrested and urged the editor to \u201ccontact all relevant persons.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burton elaborated on the circumstances leading up to Binniyat\u2019s arrest and the dangers he faces in an interview with The Christian Post.<\/p> <p>Burton attributed Binniyat\u2019s arrest to an Oct. 29 article he wrote titled \u201cIn Nigeria, Police Decry Massacres as \u2018Wicked\u2019 But Make No Arrests.\u201d The article is part of The Epoch Times\u2019 coverage of the deadly persecution of Christian farming communities in the African country that human rights advocates say have escalated to near \u201cgenocidal levels\u201d in recent years as thousands have been killed.<\/p> <p>In the article, Binniyat pushed back on Kaduna\u2019s Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan\u2019s characterization of an attack on Christian farmers in the state as a \u201cclash.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Nigerian government has long refuted claims by human rights activists that a religious genocide is taking place in Nigeria\u2019s Middle Belt states, where radicals from the Fulani herding community have been accused of invading countless Christian farming communities. The government has long attributed attacks and reprisals as being part of decades-old farmer-herder clashes.<\/p> <p>In his article, Binniyat included a quote from a Nigerian senator, who accused the Kaduna government of \u201cusing Samuel Aruwan, a Christian, to cause confusion to cover up the genocide going on in Christian Southern Kaduna by describing the measure as a \u2018clash\u2019\u201d as opposed to a targeted act of violence against Christians.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat he [Binniyat] did there is he showed that the commissioner was projecting a false narrative,\u201d Burton explained. \u201cFor this reason, I think the authorities, though they knew they would get pushback for prosecuting a dissident journalist, they decided they had to do it because \u2026 they want to shut his voice down.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burton told CP that the journalist was accused of cyberstalking Aruwan. Cyberstalking is a federal offense.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe magistrate ruled that he does not have authority to try the charge of cyberstalking because it\u2019s a federal charge, it\u2019s a federal statute. So the case will have to be transferred to a federal court. And so, therefore, in the meantime, he can\u2019t get bail because the magistrate doesn\u2019t have authority to give him bail since he doesn\u2019t have authority over this crime.\u201d<\/p> <p>Sources Burton spoke to believe that the prosecution is using a \u201clegal technicality to keep Luka in jail.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cBy having his charges presented first in a lower court, a district court where he was charged, they expected him to be charged with defamation and injurious falsehood,\u201d Burton said. \u201cThese are statutes \u2026 in the criminal code in Nigeria and can be tried at the lower court level.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cBut the charge of \u2026 cyberstalking is a federal charge that \u2026 has to be issued by a higher court,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd so by doing that deliberately, the prosecution knew that bail couldn\u2019t be given, and that is the whole idea.\u201d<\/p> <p>On Monday morning, Binniyat \u201ctexted that he felt like his life was in danger,\u201d Burton said.<\/p> <p>Additionally, Binniyat said he had been held for five days in a very \u201ccramped\u201d and \u201cdingy\u201d cell that he described as \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Binniyat further alleged that he hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe texted to another person, another journalist I know named John Shiklam. And Shiklam said he feared for his life,\u201d Burton detailed.<\/p> <p>Based on conversations with other people who have faced detention for cyberstalking in Nigeria, Burton estimates that Binniyat could spend about five months in prison.<\/p> <p>Burton specifically cited the case of Stephen Kefas, who \u201cwrote something on Facebook that embarrassed\u201d a government official. The government official claimed he was being cyberstalked and feared he could be attacked because of what Kefas wrote.<\/p> <p>Burton indicated that prolonged detention could have an impact on Binniyat\u2019s physical health.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe folks who have to spend time in custody, they have to endure pretty harsh conditions and they get sick,\u201d he warned.<\/p> <p>Kefas contracted Hepatitis C while in prison, and members of the Adara tribe who spent time in prison caught malaria, typhoid and\/or dysentery, Burton stressed.<\/p> <p>\u201cBased on what I have learned with my many conversations with Steven Kefas, the conditions in prison are not only uncomfortable, but they\u2019re dangerous and toxic,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe Adara elders were in a common cell with other criminals. They had no toilet. They have a sewer trench that goes through the middle of the cell, which serves as their toilet. Apparently, the prisoners don\u2019t have proper protection from mosquitoes because many of them come out with malaria.\u201d<\/p> <p>Based on a conversation Burton had International Committee on Nigeria Executive Director Kyle Abts, who has delivered rations to prisoners in the past, \u201cthe prisons \u2026 and jails don\u2019t provide food and water for the prisoners.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cAll their food and water has to be brought to them by their relatives,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Those without relatives or anyone to bring them food and water can \u201cbeg for charitable donations\u201d from other prisoners.<\/p> <p>Because Binniyat is \u201cnot wealthy,\u201d Burton predicted \u201che will need assistance\u201d in his legal proceedings.<\/p> <p>\u201cHis legal bills will have to be paid by his friends. That would be the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, SKPU, and also he will be getting some financial aid probably from the International Committee on Nigeria,\u201d Burton detailed. \u201cHis friends and allies are \u2026 planning some kind of a legal defense fund, but it\u2019s not clear who will take the lead.\u201d<\/p> <p>Binniyat\u2019s arrest for cyberstalking is not the first time the journalist has faced legal headwinds for his reporting.<\/p> <p>Burton recalled that Binniyat was previously imprisoned in 2017 for \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d<\/p> <p>Binniyat had previously served as the bureau chief of Vanguard Newspapers until 2017.<\/p> <p>\u201cThen after he was imprisoned, I don\u2019t think he got hired by any newspaper group because, the way it was explained to me, he\u2019s considered a controversial reporter,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo I started working with him in March this year, maybe May of this year. And I encouraged him to \u2026 compile reports for The Epoch Times. I worked with him as his editor. And so he\u2019s published some very timely and factual reports about kidnappings and mass murders this year.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burton maintained that the central claim made by Aruwan highlighted in Binniyat\u2019s Oct. 29 story, that the attacks on Christian farming communities in Nigeria are simply \u201cclashes\u201d between farmers and herders, is widely held and promoted by Nigerian government officials.<\/p> <p>\u201cThat is a distorted representation of what\u2019s really happening. In fact, there is a farmer-herder aspect to the violence,\u201d the editor added. \u201cBut that discounts the fact that the preponderance of the attacks are sectarian in \u2026 nature.\u201d<\/p>

stunning move, defense lawyers now want prosecutors to offer immunity not to their clients but to FBI agents and informants. By Julie Kelly","Input.publish_date":"2022-01-18 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The media went wild last week after Joe Biden\u2019s Justice Department finally produced a criminal indictment to support the claim that January 6 was an \u201cinsurrection\u201d planned by militiamen loyal to Donald Trump: Eleven members of the Oath Keepers, including its founder, Stewart Rhodes, face the rarely used charge of seditious conspiracy for their brief and nonviolent involvement at the Capitol protest that day.<\/p> <p>Journalists luxuriated in the news, jeering those of us who had correctly noted that the Justice Department had failed to charge anyone with insurrection or sedition for more than a year.<\/p> <p>But the press does not share the same zeal in covering another politically charged investigation: the imploding criminal case against five men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. The kidnapping narrative shares many similarities with their preferred telling of January 6, not the least of which is that alleged militias incited by Trump attempted to carry out a domestic terror attack.<\/p> <p>Despite wall-to-wall coverage after the charges in the Michigan case were announced right before Election Day, the corporate media has almost completely memory-holed the abduction caper. Stewart Rhodes is a household name; Stephen Robeson, a convicted felon and the chief FBI informant in the Whitmer case accused of all sorts of malfeasance, is not.<\/p> <p>The reason, of course, is that exposing how the FBI set a trap to lure down-on-their-luck men\u2014one of the codefendants referred to Adam Fox, the alleged plot leader, as \u201cCaptain Autism\u201d\u2014into their kidnapping ruse would run afoul of the media\u2019s insistence that the government had nothing to do with the events of January 6, despite plenty of proof that hundreds of FBI agents and informants were involved before and during the Capitol protest. (A top FBI official recently refused under oath to say whether FBI agents or assets engaged in or incited violent criminal behavior on January 6.)<\/p> <p>Perhaps the media considers it a mere coincidence that the head of the FBI Detroit field office overseeing the Whitmer plot was promoted to head of the FBI Washington, D.C. field office several weeks before January 6?<\/p> <p>Defense attorneys in the Whitmer case are making a strong case for FBI entrapment, detailing egregious misconduct by the agency, and asking a judge to dismiss the charges. At least a dozen FBI agents and confidential human sources orchestrated the kidnapping scheme; defense attorneys claim the feds \u201cactively planned and coordinated its efforts to induce the defendants to engage in incriminating behavior and statements, even going so far as designing the objective and structural components of the [kidnapping] conspiracy.\u201d<\/p> <p>In a stunning move, defense lawyers now want prosecutors to offer immunity not to their clients but to FBI agents and informants. A new defense filing took the rare step of asking the judge to order the Justice Department to offer \u201cuse immunity\u201d to every FBI asset involved in the plot. Fearing they will invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in court, defense attorneys are attempting to compel testimony that would be immune from prosecution, except charges of perjury.<\/p> <p>John Kiyonaga, a D.C. criminal defense attorney representing a few January 6 defendants, told me over the weekend that the request is \u201cmind blowingly rare.\u201d<\/p> <p>Prosecutors are desperate to conceal the FBI\u2019s animating, and likely criminal, role in the Whitmer plot. The Justice Department notified the court in December that three of the top FBI agents on the case\u2014including Richard Trask, the FBI investigator who signed the criminal complaint against the federal defendants in October 2020\u2014have been removed from the government\u2019s witness list. (The trial is set for March 8.)<\/p> <p>Trask, in fact, was fired by the FBI\u2014a near-impossible feat\u2014after he was arrested for assaulting his wife in a drunken rage following a swingers party last summer. Reporters also discovered several anti-Trump tirades posted on Trask\u2019s social media accounts.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe investigation in this case was based primarily on the efforts of FBI agents and confidential human sources,\u201d wrote Scott Graham, the attorney representing Kaleb Frank, one of five men facing conspiracy to kidnap charges, punishable by a life sentence. \u201cNormally, these people would testify at trial and would answer relevant questions posed by both sides to the case. The entrapment defense directed at both groups would be argued by the parties and decided by the jury. This case, however, is different from most. It is now apparent that a number of both the agents and sources have reason to refuse to testify by invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.\u201d<\/p> <p>Prosecutors also don\u2019t plan to call on Stephen Robeson, the informant who coordinated every surveillance and training trip related to the caper. Not only has Robeson been charged with committing at least two crimes while working the Whitmer plot, the Justice Department accuses him (implausibly) of acting as a \u201cdouble agent.\u201d<\/p> <p>Defense attorneys aren\u2019t buying the government\u2019s latest excuse to keep Robeson, a longtime FBI source, off the witness stand. Robeson\u2019s testimony, the defense argues, \u201cwill establish repeated violations of FBI policies in handling [informants], making it both exculpatory and essential.\u201d<\/p> <p>The defense also wants to show the jury at least 258 examples of recordings and communications between the informants and their FBI handlers to show how the agency directed every aspect of the attempted kidnapping. Prosecutors claim the statements are \u201chearsay\u201d and don\u2019t want jurors to see them.<\/p> <p>So, what would their unvarnished testimony and captured communications likely reveal? That without the elaborate involvement of the FBI, which compensated the lead informant at least $50,000 for six months\u2019 work and funded every outing to produce photographic evidence of the defendants\u2019 participation in weapons training camps and reconnaissance missions, the plot never would have made it past idle chatter.<\/p> <p>It likely would show how the FBI infiltrated alleged \u201cmilitia groups\u201d and even lured people into those groups beginning in early 2020 under the guise of monitoring potentially violent anti-lockdown rallies.<\/p> <p>Evidence would expose how a lockdown rally at the Michigan Capitol building in April 2020 acted as a dress rehearsal for January 6, and how the FBI steered the defendants from more lockdown protests to the kidnapping plot.<\/p> <p>The jury also would hear how Stephen D\u2019Antuono, the director of the FBI\u2019s Detroit field office, handled his agents executing the caper and how he was swiftly rewarded for his work. After his office successfully produced damaging headlines for Donald Trump right before the election, D\u2019Antuono was promoted to head of the FBI\u2019s D.C. office just three months before the Capitol protest.<\/p> <p>Unsurprisingly, prosecutors have already told the defense that they have no intention of offering immunity to their now-tarnished star government witnesses. It\u2019s unlikely a judge will avoid interfering in what is the sole purview of the Justice Department to offer immunity deals.<\/p> <p>But watching these FBI agents and informants repeatedly plead the Fifth on the stand may be as revealing as any protected testimony.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3INZSNUD8258Q2CEUOU9T9ARHFR9DK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":757,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2020","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Michigan","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Whitmer plot, Michigan","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2020","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Michigan","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Whitmer plot, Michigan","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":933519711,"Input.title":"Two arrested outside Tower Hamlets transport depot","Input.publish_date":"2020-07-06 15:46:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Two protesters were arrested in the East End today on a trade union picket line during the Tower Hamlets council workers\u2019 strike now in its second day.<\/p> <p>Striking defiance... outside Tower Hamlets council's housing office in Bethnal Green.

But since October 2017, attacks in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado \u2013 believed to be exacerbated by contestation over these resources \u2013 have morphed into extremism in a region with fertile conditions for it to thrive. As a result, a humanitarian crisis has reared its head.<\/p> <p>Oil deposits, liquefied natural gas fields and gemstones, projected in 2010 to be worth billions, have culminated in a shift in the political and social climate in neglected Cabo Delgado. Extremist insurgents, which some have claimed are linked to Islamic State, are operating with a sophistication and weaponry that have not previously been seen in the country. Their exact demands and political and economic ideology are currently unknown. Some have argued that there is no evidence of a direct link to Islamic State and that this narrative is being driven by the Mozambican state and the multinationals, because it is likely to bolster powerful external forces to mobilise against the insurgency.<\/p> <p>According to the United Nations, more than 300 000 people have been displaced, while more than 2 000 civilians have been killed. Experts say the violence, which has left villages abandoned as many flee to safety, cannot solely be linked to the Islamic State.<\/p> <p>Zenaida Machado, Angola and Mozambique researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, says the needs of the people living in the affected areas must be prioritised over profit. \u201cThe richest resource that Mozambique has is not the gas, oil or rubies, it\u2019s the people. There is no point in defending multinationals and all the wealth that they are bringing when those villages will be completely abandoned either because the residents have died, or because they ran away,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Cabo Delgado, like the rest of the country, has a high unemployment rate. There were a number of young artisanal miners working in the area before multinational corporations swooped in. Youths who needed jobs were kicked out and became vulnerable to the insurgency, and the external drive to make them join it has grown since.<\/p> <p>Bitter fruits of discontent<\/p> <p>Machado says the insurgents are able to operate in the province because they are able to exploit local political discontent. \u201cWhen people find themselves hopeless, with no one to help them and nowhere to hide, there is the idea of if you can\u2019t beat them, rather join them. And there is also the kidnapping element, where young men and young boys are kidnapped to join the insurgents. We had a situation of young men being massacred a few months back for refusing to join,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>If anything has been done to protect the people living in the affected areas, it has not yet been felt or seen. People are afraid of sleeping in their homes, opting to spend nights in the bush so that they can spot imminent danger, flee and escape. \u201cFamilies are having to walk long distances to get to accommodation\u2026 People are running away from the violence and seeking refuge in Covid-19 hotspots because those are the only safe areas for them to be,\u201d said Machado.<\/p> <p>\u00c9nio Viegas Filipe Chingotuane, head of the department of peace and security at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Maputo, says no single theory can meaningfully explain the origin of Cabo Delgado\u2019s violent extremism. \u201cOnly a mixed explanation can bring us close to the real motives, causes and reason for the uprising,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Chingotuane says Mozambique is a fragile state from every point of view and there are many factors that lure extremists, particularly in the marginalised Cabo Delgado, which he says can be called \u201can ungoverned territory\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is the poorest province with high unemployment, and no fair share of the wealth because of greed and corruption. The revenue is directed to things that aren\u2019t a priority, crippled further by a weak judicial system and a partisan security force\u2026 There is a need to save lives. They [the government] are doing certain things right, but there is a lot which is kept secret and this makes it difficult to assess what they are doing\u201d says Machado.<\/p> <p>Machado adds that if the government had the ability to handle the insurgency, it would not have struck deals with multinational corporations. \u201cThe level of destruction that this group [of insurgents] has created without us knowing who they are? I don\u2019t want to see what they will do once we know who they are\u2026 Right now it\u2019s about proving their strength.\u201d<\/p> <p>The role of multinationals<\/p> <p>Many have contested the view that multinational corporations should be approached for solutions as they are largely seen as part of the problem. The Mozambican government and French energy giant, Total recently signed the biggest energy deal in Africa, worth billions of dollars. Total has clinched the largest share in the deal\u2019s liquefaction projects, but there is interest from other partners too.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy concern with Total is that all that discussion about security never discusses people, it always discusses the infrastructure, the staff of the multinationals, the expatriates,\u201d said Machado. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t discuss the locals and I find it very unfair, disgusting and inhumane that people who have lived in those areas for decades now are forced to run away because gas has been \u2018discovered\u2019. Or [they] see themselves ignored because the priority is not to defend them, it\u2019s to defend the multinationals and the infrastructure of the big investments that are there.\u201d<\/p> <p>The American multinational ExxonMobil and the Italian oil and gas company Eni SpA, which are also investing in the country, are in talks with the Mozambican government to protect their workers while monitoring the situation.<\/p> <p>Chingotuane says eight main districts in the northern region have been affected, namely Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, Palma, Nangade, Muidumbe, Macomia, Meluco, Quissanga and Ibo. Traumatised locals flee to safety and refuge in districts with semi-guaranteed security such as Pemba, Metuge, Mueda, Montepuez and others. On 13 October, Minister of Health Armindo Tiago announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19, and although infection numbers stand at just more than 10 000 in the country, Pemba is known to be a virus hotspot.<\/p> <p>The port in Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, a strategic logistical location, was taken over for the third time in mid-August by a group of insurgents. This led to a disruption in the heavily foreign-backed project as the port is used to transport building materials, oil and gas equipment.<\/p> <p>Although a security force contingency has been sent to deal with the insurgency and regain the port, it remains to be seen if the state can contain it as it is understaffed, underequipped and underfinanced. Chingotuane argues that the state has no ability to handle the insurgency on its own.<\/p> <p>\u201cMozambican security forces are in a bad shape due to many years of low funding and neglect. None of its arms is up to the task in Cabo Delgado. The air force is almost nonexistent, the navy is far from its military capacity and the army is [struggling] to maintain its functionality and execute its mission. The cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineering and communications are all badly affected by poor financing. Problems also involve strategy, doctrine, logistics, training and military exercises,\u201d said Chingotuane.<\/p> <p>Government response<\/p> <p>On Sunday 4 October, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said he would continue strengthening the military intervention capacity of the defence and security forces so that they can respond \u201cmore effectively to terrorist attacks\u201d.<\/p> <p>He was speaking at Pra\u00e7a dos Her\u00f3is (Heroes\u2019 Square) in Maputo, incidentally on the same day that the country celebrated its Peace and National Reconciliation Day. The holiday marks the end of the 15-year civil war between ruling party Frelimo and rebel group turned political movement, Renamo, with an agreement signed in Rome in 1992.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe strongly condemn these acts and reiterate that, as a state, we will continue to use all the resources at our disposal to guarantee public order and security, because the Mozambican people deserve to have a country at peace,\u201d said Nyusi.<\/p> <p>On 29 September, Nyusi was named the 2020 \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d by Africa Oil & Power, an investment platform for the energy sector. The accolade goes to people who supposedly display \u201ctrue leadership and innovative thinking in steering their countries \u2026 to the forefront of the global energy sector\u201d.<\/p> <p>Also in September, Reuters reported that Mozambique approached the European Union for help and support in training local security forces to counter the recurring wave of attacks. This is a different strategy from the initial denial, dismissal and downplaying of the attacks as criminal activity.<\/p> <p>Security forces\u2019 role<\/p> <p>Machado says the security forces behaving in hostile ways towards suspects, who could be innocent, breeds anger and resentment among the population. \u201cWe have documented in the past cases where security forces arrived in a village following an attack and rounded up people. Any person that was seen running away, carrying machetes or [who was] still physically okay in a place of chaos was seen as a suspect.\u201d<\/p> <p>In 2019, Human Rights Watch raised concerns over the number of people being detained unlawfully in overcrowded cells for lengthy periods, including women with young babies who were accused of aiding the insurgents. They were later released owing to a lack of evidence linking them to the conflict, and the judiciary pleaded with the security forces to exercise caution during arrests.<\/p> <p>Machado says there is a need for everyone to go through the lawful justice process because many have been arrested and have not seen a court, which allows for radicalisation to take place. \u201cMany are arrested and placed in jail for months in the same cells with insurgents. Once released, they are either further radicalised, recruited or join voluntarily, or they are unable to be located as they do not return to their villages because of the fear of reprisals and stereotypes,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>In disturbing footage circulated in September, a naked woman is seen running as she is hounded by a group of men \u2013 one of whom is video recording the incident \u2013 clad in security force uniforms and carrying heavy arms. As the woman slows down, they catch up to her and one starts beating her with what looks like a stick before telling her to go. Another man then shoots her at close range before she is hit by a hail of more than 30 bullets. Even when her lifeless body is on the floor and a man says in Portuguese \u201cthat\u2019s enough\u201d, different men continue to shoot at her before one says proudly to the camera, \u201cWe have killed Al-Shabaab.\u201d<\/p> <p>On 10 September, Colonel Omar Nala Saranga, a spokesperson for the defence ministry, said \u201cone of the tactics used by terrorists in their macabre incursions against the population is to pretend to be elements of the FDS [Defence and Security Forces]\u201d. He denied Amnesty International\u2019s allegations of abuses by claiming that the videos and pictures were fake. He distanced the FDS from the murder and essentially claimed that it was the work of militants. In mid-September, the ministry condemned the act but did not confirm or deny that these were members of its rapid intervention unit.<\/p> <p>Machado says the actions of the security forces and the government are boosting rather than reducing the capacity of the insurgents, and the government is losing the trust of the people as more heinous allegations of human rights violations, including beheadings and torture, surface.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey need to stop people from being recruited. In an environment of mistrust and resentment, it\u2019s very easy to divide and rule. And if the government really wants to recover that trust from the Mozambicans, one thing they should do is to communicate better on what they are doing and protect people\u2026 People also need to see people in uniforms as their protectors, not their offenders or abusers,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Humanitarian crisis<\/p> <p>In areas such as Macomia and Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, where villages have been attacked and the conflict has been problematic, the healthcare offered was already deficient before the violence flared up. \u201cHumanitarian groups that were operating in some of those areas \u2026 have left because of the [lack of] security. The kind of shelter they had was poor, but some of it was also destroyed by Cyclone Kenneth which hit the country, so the government was already struggling to take care of people in those regions,\u201d said Machado.<\/p> <p>At the end of September, Minister of Economy and Finance Adriano Maleiane stated that a finance margin was needed to redirect resources to support \u201cthe war effort\u201d, describing the situation in Cabo Delgado as bad for families and the economy. \u201cThe few resources we are allocating to the social areas are not sufficient and we must invent \u2026 more resources for the war,\u201d he said in Maputo.<\/p> <p>However, Machado says the government needs to ensure that there are strategies in place to deal with the humanitarian crisis coming out of this conflict. \u201cIn a moment of conflict, all the resources available go to ensure that the insurgents are defeated and the locals are left on their own\u2026 Those who manage to get to camps find other challenges such as a lack of tents, low supplies of food, sanitation issues, cholera and malaria.<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople need shelter, they need food, missing persons will need to be found, children have been away from school for the past three years, hospitals and schools are getting destroyed. The level of trauma that these people are affected by is high,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>This article was first published on New Frame<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3TX9T2ZCBBGM5ZUIFHTYYL153YLZWY"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":698,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"September","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cabo Delgado","country":"Mozambique","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civilians, women, children, rape, murder, FDS","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"September","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cabo Delgado","country":"Mozambique","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civilians, women, children, rape, murder, FDS","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":987712913,"Input.title":"Students abducted by gunmen in north central Nigeria","Input.publish_date":"2021-05-30 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>LAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 A large number of students were abducted Sunday and one person was killed at a school in Nigeria\u2019s north central Niger State, a police spokesman said.<\/p> <p>Nigerian media, including the independent Channels TV, said about 200 students were abducted at the Salihu Tanko Islamic School in Tegina in the local government area of Rafi.<\/p> <p>Wasiu Abiodun, the Niger state police spokesman, confirmed the incident, though without giving a number for those abducted.<\/p> <p>He said the abduction was carried out by \u201carmed bandits on board motorcycles in their numbers.\u201d The gunmen fired \u201cindiscriminately and abducted a yet to be ascertained number of children,\u201d he said, adding that the gunmen shot one person dead in the process.<\/p> <p>All \u201ctactical teams\u201d have been mobilized to rescue the victims and the police will \u201censure that the children are rescued unhurt,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>The incident is the latest in a series of mass abductions in Nigerian schools by armed gangs who collect money for ransom.

Rehman, who passed away in Lahore on April 12.<\/p> <p>The first speaker was architect Arif Hasan. He divided his talk into three parts: his relationship with Rehman sahib, his personality and legacy. He said he met the late journalist and activist in Lahore in 1967 for the first time where he (Hasan) had gone to work. Although Rehman sahib was 12 or 13 years older than him, they would meet every evening where they\u2019d be joined by the likes of Dr Mehdi Hasan and Nisar Osmani. Rehman sahib used to call the architect \u2018kitab\u2019. Even after he returned to Karachi from Lahore, both kept meeting on a regular basis. Their relationship deepened when Bangladesh was trying to gain independence. Their ties further strengthened during Z.A. Bhutto and Gen Ziaul Haq\u2019s tenures.<\/p> <p>On the second point, Mr Hasan said Rehman sahib was a good listener. He knew how to lend an ear to people. He would never interrupt anyone while they were talking, even when they would be presenting a point of view opposite to his. He never spoke ill of anyone. At meetings and seminars, he would give an opinion that differed from others\u2019 with a sense of humour. He never spoke about himself. Once, he visited his birthplace in Gurgaon, India. When he came back, nobody could detect an air of nostalgia in his narration about his place of birth. He talked about it like a tourist would. He was an extremely well-informed man who turned his wealth of information into knowledge (ilm).<\/p> <p>Mr Hasan, speaking about his legacy, said Rehman sahib has left behind the institutions that he was associated with and founded; his efforts to bring peace between India and Pakistan; his resolve that we should not be afraid of speaking the truth; and the youngsters who in their small but significant ways have established human rights and social welfare groups.<\/p> <p>\u2018He was a good listener, and never spoke ill of anyone\u2019<\/p> <p>Executive director of PILER Karamat Ali said he had worked with Rehman sahib as a trade unionist and human rights activist. He had known him since 1971 when he visited Lahore with Sadequain. Rehman sahib at the time was looking after a newspaper, Azad. He (Ali) was deeply impressed with him from day one. After that he got to work with him at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and alongside him on projects that aimed to bring India and Pakistan closer. Whichever country he visited, it seemed as if it was his own because people there would greet him with a great deal of warmth.<\/p> <p>Mr Ali said Rehman sahib was like a father to him. On April 12, when he passed away, he (Ali) felt like an orphan. Speaking with him used to put him at peace. The late activist respected everyone\u2019s point of view.<\/p> <p>Resident director Sindh, Aurat Foundation, Mahnaz Rahman said on April 12 she was at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) where an event was being held to mark the first death anniversary of journalist Ahfazur Rahman. There, the participants were in shock to receive the news of Rehman sahib\u2019s passing. In September last year, when a condolence reference was held for Ahfazur Rahman at the Arts Council, Rehman sahib came from Lahore and delivered the keynote address.<\/p> <p>She said the news of Rehman sahib\u2019s death flooded social media with messages. She mentioned two of them. One was from an admirer of Rehman sahib who wrote that he\u2019s the \u2018father of human rights\u2019. The second was from a woman activist who said that women always felt comfortable working alongside Rehman sahib because he understood women\u2019s issues. In that regard, she read out excerpts from an article by Rehman sahib which he wrote in favour of Aurat March.<\/p> <p>Earlier, chairperson of PIIA Masuma Hasan introduced the speakers to the online audience.

Authorities also abused their powers to stop people accessing or sharing information online. During protests in Iran, the authorities implemented a near-total internet shutdown to stop people sharing videos and photos of security forces unlawfully killing and injuring protesters. In Egypt, authorities disrupted online messaging applications in an attempt to thwart further protests. Egyptian and Palestinian authorities also resorted to censoring websites including news websites. In Iran social media apps including Facebook, Telegram, Twitter and YouTube remained blocked.<\/p> <p>Some governments also use more sophisticated techniques of online surveillance to target human rights defenders. Amnesty\u2019s research highlighted how two Moroccan human rights defenders were targeted using spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group.

The announcement by the International Criminal Court (ICC) that war crimes had been committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and that an investigation should be opened as soon as the ICC\u2019s territorial jurisdiction has been confirmed offered a crucial opportunity to end decades of impunity. The ICC indicated that the investigation could cover Israel\u2019s killing of protesters in Gaza.<\/p> <p>The fact that governments across MENA have a zero-tolerance approach to peaceful online expression shows how they fear the power of ideas that challenge official narratives.

Saudi Arabia introduced long-overdue reforms to its male guardianship system, but these were overshadowed by the fact that five women human rights defenders remained unjustly detained for their activism throughout 2019.<\/p> <p>Governments across the region must learn that their repression of protests and imprisonment of peaceful critics and human rights defenders will not silence people\u2019s demands for fundamental economic, social and political rights Heba Morayef<\/p> <p>A number of Gulf states also announced reforms to improve protection for migrant workers including promises from Qatar to abolish its kafala (sponsorship system) and improve migrants\u2019 access to justice.

Outside, the apple trees are in bloom. But in villages spread across Pulwama and Shopian in south Kashmir, long considered by the authorities to be the centre of militant activity, young men and their families are saying they have been subject to violence, even torture, at the hands of Indian soldiers. Some have spoken on record to the international press about severe beatings, even electric shocks. A report by a group of women fact-finders who visited Kashmir in September alleged that some 13,000 boys, many as young as 14, have been held in prisons for weeks. While there is no official confirmation of these numbers, the government admitted to a Supreme Court-appointed committee that 144 boys, some as young as nine, have been arrested since August 5 for stone-pelting.<\/p> <p>But the young man in Arihal, in his 20s, says he was just working his paddy field with his wife when soldiers assaulted him on September 28. \"Three soldiers held me down,\" he alleges. They covered his mouth so he couldn't scream and then, \"one of the soldiers punched me until I bled.\" The other two \"thrashed my body and legs and hurled abuses at me\", he says. \"Then they asked me to kneel in the sun and hold my head between my knees while the blood dripped from my nose and mouth.\"<\/p> <p>Not long after the assault, the young man fainted. He woke up in a government hospital in Pulwama, where the doctors noted his case down as an \"alleged assault\". The army, he says, wanted to know who had invited a \"maulvi\" to address the congregation on Friday at a mosque in his village. As we journalists left his home that afternoon, a group of soldiers, maybe half a dozen, appeared in the neighbourhood in black combat fatigues.<\/p> <p>In Pulwama's Chandgam village, consisting of more than 2,000 households, you see only elderly men on the streets, gossiping behind the shutters of shops closed to business or hailing a ride from a passing car. The young men are either indoors, scared to attract attention, or have run away from their homes altogether so as not to be found by soldiers.<\/p> <p>Despite the many reports of arrests and violence inflicted on young men, the army has steadfastly denied all allegations of torture.

But at the hospital in Pulwama, senior doctors tell harrowing stories of treating young men who have clearly been victims of assault amounting to torture. One doctor said he treated five men who had sustained serious injuries to their ear drums. Another man's buttocks were swollen and blue from the severity of his beating. \"In 2016,\" he says, referring to the months of unrest after security forces killed Burhan Wani, commander of separatist group Hizbul Mujahideen, \"we'd be treating lots of young men wounded by pellet guns. But in the last two months, we have been receiving patients who have been beaten.\"<\/p> <p>(Photo: ANI)<\/p> <p>Army chief General Bipin Rawat has been quoted in interviews saying he would \"personally order a full-fledged probe\" should any \"victim\" come forward with an allegation of torture. \"But\", he added, \"I can say for sure that no such action has taken place.\" The Pulwama police is investigating one allegation of torture by the army. On September 17, 15-year-old Yawar Ahmad Bhat, from Chandgam, drank poison. He died two days later in hospital. His family says he was detained and beaten by soldiers the day before he took the poison.<\/p> <p>Where are the restrictions? It is only in your mind. There are no restrictions. Only misinformation about restrictions is being spread... Lack of phone connection is not a human rights violation - Union home minister Amit Shah assured participants at a seminar, in Delhi on September 29, that all was well in Kashmir<\/p> <p>\"Last year, he dropped out of school,\" says Bhat's father. \"His cousin and classmate had been injured by a pellet gun. He was working at an auto workshop, but this year both boys were going to take their exams.\" Bhat's family says the soldiers stopped him when he was on his way to buy paint for a car on which his shop was working \"discreetly\" because all commercial establishments had been shuttered since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. Bhat was beaten, his identity card seized and he was told to report to a nearby camp the next morning. His fear of what would be done to him at the camp, his father says, is what drove him to suicide. Kohli says the investigation into Bhat's suicide is still in its early stages, but the army has already described the family's claims as \"baseless\".<\/p> <p>After releasing their report, the all-women fact-finding team called for an inquiry into the allegations of torture.

industry.<\/p> <p>Exploitation in Leicester\u2019s garment industry has been an \u201copen secret\u201d and widely reported and studied for at least a decade, yet successive conservative governments have failed to act.<\/p> <p>Despite the extended media focus, as the year draws to a close, the central questions remain unanswered \u2014 what progress has been made this year, and who is protecting workers in Leicester\u2019s garment industry?<\/p> <p>Tomorrow, the environmental audit committee \u2014 of which I am a member \u2014 shall be examining Leicester\u2019s garment industry as part of our follow-up inquiry on fashion sustainability.<\/p> <p>Shamefully, the government rejected most if not all the recommendations of the committee\u2019s 2019 inquiry entitled Fixing Fashion: Clothing Consumption and Sustainability, which highlighted concerns regarding fast fashion and exploitation in Leicester\u2019s garment industry.<\/p> <p>After this year\u2019s resurgence of reports and widespread condemnation into the scandal, the government must take its head out of the sand and legislate to protect vulnerable workers.<\/p> <p>The investigation will include an evidence session with Boohoo Group\u2019s executive chairman, Mahmud Kaman.<\/p> <p>The recent Levitt inquiry, commissioned by Boohoo itself, found that Boohoo was aware of endemic workers\u2019 rights abuses in Leicester\u2019s garment industry.<\/p> <p>By procuring garments from companies that routinely under-report hours, force employees to work in buildings that pose a severe fire risk and pay as little as four times lower than the legal minimum wage \u2014 BooHoo has been complicit in severe instances of exploitation.<\/p> <p>Yet it chose to ignore the plight of workers in order to seek ever-higher profits, as sales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have also helped reward BooHoo\u2019s bosses with bonuses worth \u00a3150 million.<\/p> <p>Yet despite being at the centre of this scandal, it is unclear what action BooHoo has taken to end exploitation in their supply chains.<\/p> <p>For example, it is not clear what steps Boohoo has taken to ensure that its purchasing practices don\u2019t act as a driver for illegal pay and poor conditions.<\/p> <p>Boohoo must sign the transparency pledge and make all of its supplier details public (at home and abroad).<\/p> <p>Indeed, it is appalling that Boohoo has not yet published a full list of its suppliers \u2014 despite promising to do so.<\/p> <p>This only begs the question, what is it attempting to hide?<\/p> <p>As the excellent campaign group Labour Behind the Label argue, Boohoo must also end its behaviour of terminating ties with suppliers without paying back wages.<\/p> <p>Going further than this, Boohoo should make funding immediately available to ensure that all workers who have enabled their huge profits are fully compensated for years of working at less than half the minimum wage.<\/p> <p>Beyond Boohoo, the government and regulatory institutions are not doing nearly enough to protect and recompense underpaid workers.<\/p> <p>Workers are still not being paid at least the minimum wage and remain for years on zero-hours contracts without access to holiday pay, sick pay, meal breaks or time-off pay.<\/p> <p>There are still grave concerns regarding the illegal use of furlough, double record keeping and unsafe and dangerous work environments.<\/p> <p>Research carried out by the University of Leicester in 2015 revealed that most garment workers were paid way below the national minimum wage, did not have employment contracts, and were subject to intense and arbitrary work practices.<\/p> <p>The research calculated that the average wage was approximately \u00a33 per hour and made a conservative estimate that the underpaid wage sum in apparel manufacturing within the East Midlands was around \u00a31 million per week.<\/p> <p>A more recent study by the British Retail Consortium puts the figure at nearer 2.1 million per week.<\/p> <p>The workers whose wages have been stolen from them must be recompensed.<\/p> <p>Serious questions need to be asked about the extent to which some among Leicester textile suppliers have engaged in money laundering and VAT fraud.<\/p> <p>A recent BBC investigation found that firms in Leicester which supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion had engaged in fraudulent practices, including misleading invoices and cash laundering transactions.<\/p> <p>This investigation found that \u00a38m had been received by six companies said to be issuing fake invoices to the original wholesaler, which means that as much as \u00a31.6m of VAT was not recovered.<\/p> <p>As this investigation was only the tip of the iceberg, it is possible that tens or even hundreds of millions of taxes are being avoided across the sector.<\/p> <p>One of the main reasons why these appalling instances of workplace exploitation in Leicester have been able to exist unchecked, is that 10 years of austerity has severely downgraded our regulatory institutions.<\/p> <p>The local authority in Leicester has had its central government grant funding cut from \u00a3289m in 2010 to \u00a3171m in 2019.<\/p> <p>The government has also slashed the budget of the Health and Safety Executive by \u00a3100m, or 46 per cent, since 2010.<\/p> <p>The budget of HM Revenue and Customs, the body which is meant to enforce the minimum wage, was 40 per cent less in 2016 than in 2000, and staffing levels were reduced by approximately 50 per cent over the same period.<\/p> <p>In 2020, HMRC\u2019s national minimum wage team remains significantly under-resourced, meaning the risk of inspection is low.<\/p> <p>The most recent director of labour market strategy states that \u201cthe average employer can expect an inspection around once every 500 years.\u201d<\/p> <p>There are also grave concerns regarding the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), which is dubbed by the government as the leading investigative agency for labour exploitation in Britain.<\/p> <p>For one thing, between July and August 2020 \u2014 the peak of coverage of this crisis \u2014 GLAA did not carry out any enforcement action against employers.<\/p> <p>Yet equally worrying is the fact that investigations carried out previously by GLAA involved joint work with immigration enforcement.<\/p> <p>For instance, in 2011, Operation Serbal was launched by the UK Border Agency and so called \u201cillegal workers\u201d were arrested in a series of raids on Leicester clothing factories, between May and July 2011.<\/p> <p>Indeed, this summer saw a noticeable increase in immigration enforcement vans following the recent resurgence in media reports on this scandal.<\/p> <p>This is as counterproductive as it is callous.

Bradbury has emerged as a shill for the security agencies, and is fingering the Trotskyist movement for state repression. His hysterical outburst, under the headline \u201cChina lab leak theory refuses to die,\u201d is further confirmation that there is nothing remotely left wing or progressive about the Daily Blog, a middle-class nationalist publication that supports the Labour Party-Greens government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.<\/p> <p>The attack on the SEG, which was reposted on April 27 with an extended denunciation of China, has the character of a preemptive strike. It is aimed at intimidating anyone who opposes the pro-war hysteria being whipped up by Washington and its allies, including the New Zealand political establishment and media. The Daily Blog\u2019s post undoubtedly reflects discussions that are underway within the political establishment about how to stop the development of a genuine internationalist revolutionary leadership in the working class to oppose the drive to war and the capitalist system that is its source.<\/p> <p>Bradbury\u2019s reference to China\u2019s human rights abuses echoes the cynical propaganda from the media and US intelligence agencies, which have accused China, without any evidence, of carrying out \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Uyghur population. The US ruling class has zero concern for the working class in China, including the Uyghurs, who certainly suffer repression and exploitation at the hands of the capitalist state.<\/p> <p>The political opposition of the Trotskyist movement to the Maoist Chinese Communist Party regime in Beijing and its oppressive methods from the standpoint of the international working class is longstanding and well-documented. However, the US is actively preparing for war with China and deliberately escalating tensions with Beijing.<\/p> <p>Over the past three decades, it is US imperialism and its allies, not China, which are responsible for the criminal wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya\u2014to name only a few of the most recent\u2014that have killed millions of people and destroyed entire societies. The invocation of \u201chuman rights\u201d has been used to justify every single war against America\u2019s enemies\u2014including the present US-NATO proxy war against Russia in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Bradbury\u2019s attack on the SEG comes as the war in Ukraine escalates, and there are growing threats against China, which US imperialism regards as the major obstacle to its domination over the Eurasian landmass. The Ardern government has sent dozens of troops to Europe to join the war effort and faces a growing crisis in New Zealand. As elsewhere around the globe, historic class struggles are on the agenda, fuelled by the soaring cost of living and the disastrous spread of COVID-19.<\/p> <p>There are precedents for the sort of state repression the Daily Blog is demanding. During the First and Second World Wars, the New Zealand state imprisoned hundreds of anti-war and left-wing activists for \u201csedition\u201d; leftist and socialist publications were banned. In the United States, 18 members of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party were put on trial and sentenced to prison terms during WWII for opposing the war.<\/p> <p>Bradbury\u2019s comparison of the SEG to Vidkun Quisling, Norway\u2019s Nazi-collaborationist leader in World War II, is not accidental: during World War II, the Trotskyists were smeared as fascist collaborators, by Stalinists and others, because of their principled opposition to war. By absurdly painting China as the modern-day equivalent to Nazi Germany, the Daily Blog presents any opposition to the US-led war drive as criminal.<\/p> <p>Bradbury makes clear that what he regards as \u201ctreason\u201d is the SEG\u2019s exposure of the anti-Chinese propaganda that he has been publishing for years to justify New Zealand\u2019s integration into the US military build-up in the Indo-Pacific region. The blog post particularly objected to a World Socialist Web Site article by SEG member John Braddock, which outlined the Daily Blog\u2019s role in promoting the right-wing conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in a laboratory in Wuhan.<\/p> <p>The theory, which has been thoroughly discredited by scientists, was concocted by Trump\u2019s fascist ally Steve Bannon and his associates. The lab leak lie serves definite political purposes: to divert blame for the disastrous US response to the pandemic, which has led to more than a million deaths; and to demonise China in preparation for war. The Daily Blog editor unabashedly lines up behind Trump, declaring that he \u201cmight have been right all along\u201d and that \u201cdeep suspicion of China is justified.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Daily Blog paints China as a threat to New Zealand and calls for it to be turned into a \u201cfortress,\u201d with military spending increased from 1.5 to 5 percent of GDP. Bradbury has joined the latest media furor over China\u2019s security agreement with the Solomon Islands. On March 26, he declared: \u201cChina is stepping into our sphere of influence through insidious means masquerading as security.\u201d He called for NZ \u201cto decouple its economy from China,\u201d describing this as a \u201cnational security issue.\u201d<\/p> <p>Since 2017, the Daily Blog has promoted the pro-US academic Anne-Marie Brady, a key player in New Zealand and Australia\u2019s anti-China campaign. She has accused Chinese-born MPs of being spies, and demanded state surveillance of Chinese student organisations, cultural groups, media organisations, academics and businesses with ties to China.<\/p> <p>Now, Bradbury wants this witch hunt to be extended to target the Trotskyist movement, the only political tendency fighting to build a global movement of the working class against war, based on socialist and internationalist principles.<\/p> <p>Internationally, as the danger of a third world war increases, the ICFI faces increasing censorship and threats of state surveillance. In Germany, the Socialist Equality Party has been labelled as \u201cleft wing extremist\u201d by the state security agency, because of its opposition to capitalism and to the revival of militarism. In Australia, where the Morrison government and Labor are promising billions of dollars for the military to prepare for war with China, electoral laws have been changed in order to prevent the SEP and other minor parties from participating in the current election under their party name.<\/p> <p>Internationally, the US-led war plans are backed by various pseudo-left groups, which are close to the trade union bureaucracy and represent sections of the upper middle class. These include the Democratic Socialists of America, Socialist Alliance in Australia, and the Left Party in Germany, among others.<\/p> <p>In New Zealand, the Daily Blog speaks for a similar middle-class layer, close to the Labour Party and its allies, including the unions, which fears any working class movement developing against the Ardern government\u2019s militarist policies, as well as its assault on living standards and the criminal decision to end NZ\u2019s COVID-19 elimination strategy.<\/p> <p>In the final analysis, the privileges of the upper middle classes depend on the suppression of the class struggle at home, and on New Zealand\u2019s alliance with the US and Australia, which safeguards NZ\u2019s neo-colonial \u201csphere of influence\u201d in the Pacific and its business interests throughout the world.<\/p> <p>The blog\u2019s contributors include former Unite union leader Mike Treen, liberal commentator Chris Trotter, former Alliance Party member Liz Gordon, former Mana Party member John Minto, and other individuals from the pseudo-left liberal milieu. None of them has objected to Bradbury\u2019s embrace of the SIS and his denunciation of socialists as traitors; this is because they agree with him.<\/p> <p>We call on workers to reject the nationalist and militarist propaganda spewed out by the Daily Blog, and to defend the SEG and the WSWS against Bradbury\u2019s provocative call for suppression by the state.<\/p> <p>Workers and young people seeking to oppose war can only do so by turning to the socialist and internationalist program fought for by the SEG, which is aimed at uniting workers throughout the world in opposition to the capitalist system. In New Zealand, this requires a political break from the Labour Party and its supporters, including the Daily Blog.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"39KV3A5D1AMAE873CHREAC5LNSCS7K"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":356,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2022","month":"April","date":"16.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"New Zealand","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"SEG, Socialist Equality Group, China, New Zealand, U.S.","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2022","month":"April","date":"16.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"New Zealand","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"SEG, Socialist Equality Group, China, New Zealand, U.S.","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":920724988,"Input.title":"Chinese Lawyer Completes 4-Year Prison Sentence","Input.publish_date":"2020-04-28 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang was finally allowed to see his family in Beijing on Monday, three weeks after he was nominally released from a 4.5-year prison sentence.<\/p> <p>Wang was thrown into a dubious \u201ccoronavirus quarantine\u201d after his jail term ended, then forbidden to travel to Beijing. He told reporters on Monday he might not be allowed to stay with his family for long, even though his wife is gravely ill.<\/p> <p>Wang was arrested without due process during a vicious persecution of human rights lawyers and democracy activists known as the 709 Crackdown, because it began on July 9, 2015.

He was convicted of \u201csubverting state power\u201d in January 2019, probably because he offered legal representation to members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, and \u201csentenced to four years and six months in prison, and deprived of political rights for five years,\u201d according to the court statement. He was finally allowed to see his family in prison for the first time in June 2019, four years after the CCP made him disappear.<\/p> <p>Amnesty International declared Wang a \u201cprisoner of conscience\u201d who was \u201cat risk of torture and other ill-treatment,\u201d unsuccessfully demanding his immediate release. Human Rights Watch noted that Wang\u2019s detention and the constant official harassment of his family violated both Chinese and international law.<\/p> <p>Persistent reports circulated that Wang was tortured with electric shocks during his detention. He told reporters on Monday he is not yet comfortable with discussing how he is treated, which is unsurprising given that he remains under constant surveillance and could be whisked away from his wife and son again at any moment.<\/p> <p>After Wang was released from prison, he was immediately \u201cquarantined\u201d for possible coronavirus exposure, effectively putting him under house arrest in his hometown of Jinan for weeks while his family waited in Beijing. When the \u201cquarantine\u201d was finally lifted, he was told he was not allowed to travel to Beijing. His movements remained restricted to short shopping trips around Jinan, and friends said they feared they would be \u201cquarantined\u201d as well if they went to visit him.<\/p> <p>The U.S. State Department denounced the continuing persecution of Wang Quanzhang last week and demanded he be allowed to rejoin his family in Beijing. When Wang learned his wife Li Wenzu was suffering from severe abdominal pain, he defied the police and tried to take a taxi to Beijing. He was seized by masked plainclothes police officers when his taxi reached the highway and detained for a while, but eventually allowed to complete his journey to Beijing.<\/p> <p>Radio Free Asia (RFA) described the emotional reunion between Wang, Li, and their seven-year-old son:<\/p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve dreamed of us being reunited during the past five years,\u201d his wife Li Wenzu said as the couple hugged. \u201cNow it feels as if I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d \u201cDad, we\u2019re having dumplings this evening,\u201d the couple\u2019s young son Wang Guangwei told his father in a video made available by the family via social media. \u201cGreat, can I have a hug now?\u201d Wang replied, before sitting with his arms around his wife and child on the family sofa.<\/p> <p>In a videotaped recording of the family union, Wang said he felt as though he has awakened from a trance and said it took him five years to realize his dream of once more holding his wife and child. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be apart again, will we?\u201d Li asked him.<\/p> <p>Li has been hospitalized for her abdominal pain and may soon require surgery for appendicitis, according to a friend of the family, who added she has \u201cbeen under constant psychological pressure for the past five years.\u201d Li herself said she has received treatment, but is still in some pain.<\/p> <p>Li captured international attention in April 2018 by shaving her head and marching over 60 miles from Beijing to Tianjin, the city where her husband was incarcerated, to raise awareness of his plight and demand answers from the authorities. At the time, she was not certain if Wang was still alive, fearing he might have been tortured to death in a bid to extract a forced confession.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are walking to seek an answer from the Chinese legal system.

For example, there was a marked reduction in forced labor in Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton fields, and a handful of nongovernmental organizations were allowed to register. However, many human rights groups still face significant obstacles trying to register their organizations, and Uzbekistan\u2019s political system remains largely authoritarian. Consensual same-sex relations between men continue to be criminalized, carrying a prison sentence of one to three years.<\/p> <p>Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (Articles 2 and 12)<\/p> <p>Under article 120 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, men in Uzbekistan who engage in consensual same-sex sexual conduct can be prosecuted and face three-years imprisonment.[1] Uzbek authorities have repeatedly dismissed calls to decriminalize homosexuality, and a new draft Criminal Code[2] retains the offense, with the wording unchanged, in article 154, in a section of the code related to \u201ccrimes against morality and family\u201d.<\/p> <p>Gay men face threats and extortion by both police and non-state actors. Uzbek law has no provision for hate crimes, nor can crimes be prosecuted as aggravated offenses if they are motivated by hatred based on discrimination. Uzbekistan has yet to adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that includes sexual orientation and gender identity as a protected ground. As of September 2019, the Uzbek government said there were no ongoing criminal investigations involving violence against LGBT people.<\/p> <p>Uzbek police and courts have relied on the conclusions of forced anal examinations conducted between 2017 and 2021 to prosecute men for consensual same-sex relations. In a recent case of which Human Rights Watch is aware, Internal Affairs officials ordered doctors to perform forced anal exams on two men in early 2021. A Tashkent court sentenced both men to two years under house arrest, partly based on medical reports from the exams purporting to find evidence of same-sex conduct. The men, who had lived together before the arrest, were ordered to serve their sentences in cities 500 kilometers apart and have been prohibited from using the internet. The verdict against the two men confirms that both were subjected to forced anal exams while in detention. The ruling relied in part on a medical examiner\u2019s report suggesting that \u201cbruises and superficial tears,\u201d \u201cradial turns\u201d that are \u201cslightly smooth,\u201d and a \u201cslightly weakened\u201d anal sphincter tone were likely evidence of anal sex. The court ruling seems to rely on bogus theories[3] popularized by an 1857 French medical text on how to identify a \u201chabitual pederast\u201d through anal examination.[4]<\/p> <p>Forced anal exams, conducted purportedly to find \u201cproof\u201d of homosexual conduct, often involve doctors or other medical personnel inserting their fingers, and sometimes other objects, into the anus of the accused without their consent, in an attempt to determine whether the person has engaged in receptive anal intercourse. The World Health Organization has denounced the exams as a form of violence and torture.[5]<\/p> <p>The World Medical Association[6] has called on medical professionals to stop conducting the exams, saying that it is \u201cdeeply disturbed by the complicity of medical personnel in these non-voluntary and unscientific examinations, including the preparation of medical reports that are used in trials to convict men and transgender women of consensual same-sex conduct.\u201d[7]<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Decriminalize consensual same sex conduct between men and halt any prosecutions under article 120 of the Criminal Code; ensure the personal security, privacy, and non-discrimination of the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in Uzbekistan;<\/p> <p>Immediately ban forced anal exams and their use as evidence to prosecute men for consensual same-sex relations;<\/p> <p>Investigate attacks and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including threats made by law enforcement officers to use article 120 against people, and hold those responsible to account;<\/p> <p>Adopt effective nondiscrimination policies, combat violence, harassment, and hatred against LGBT people, and facilitate the registration and operation of nongovernmental groups working on LGBT issues.<\/p> <p>Labour rights (Article 6, 7 and 8)<\/p> <p>Since the last review of Uzbekistan\u2019s record, Uzbekistan has made significant efforts to reduce forced labor in its cotton sector. Positive steps that contributed to reduction of forced labour are the criminalization in January 2020 of the repeated use of forced labour, and the elimination in March 2020 of the production quota system.<\/p> <p>Although the International Labour Organization (ILO) concluded in January 2021 that there was no systemic forced or child labor in the 2020 cotton harvest, it noted that \u201cabout four percent [of pickers] were subject to direct or perceived forms of coercion,\u201d that is, approximately 80,000 people.[8] In October 2020, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights reported that the government forced employees of public institutions and enterprises to pick cotton or pay for replacement pickers during the 2020 harvest.<\/p> <p>The ILO also noted that in the 2020 cotton harvest \u201cthere were [only] isolated cases of minors below the legal working age picking cotton.\u201d However, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights[9] found during the Fall 2021 cotton harvest \u201cmore cases of child labor than in recent years, when only sporadic cases were identified \u2026they [children] were accompanied by their parents and likely reflects increasing poverty in rural areas.\u201d Nevertheless for the cotton harvest in 2021, for the first time in more than a decade of monitoring cotton harvest, Uzbek Forum for Human Rights found no systematic forced labor organized by state officials.<\/p> <p>However, the progress in elimination forced labour varies greatly between different regions of Uzbekistan. The Uzbek Forum documented that in areas which lack voluntary pickers, officials of mahalla (neighbourhood committees) resorted to pressure on potential pickers, by threatening residents that their social benefits would be reduced or withheld. Farmers lack bargaining power when it comes to negotiating their contracts and cotton price.[10]<\/p> <p>The lack of independent trade unions and civil society organizations in Uzbekistan to protect workers\u2019 rights and monitor the government\u2019s compliance with the ban on forced labor undermines sustainability of progress made so far in the cotton sector.<\/p> <p>During the reporting period, the authorities in Uzbekistan interfered regularly in the work of civil society. For example, on February 1, 2020 in Nukus, a city in Karakalpakstan, several activists, and the founding members of Chiroq, an NGO that focuses on monitoring forced labor in the cotton sector, met with five representatives of the Cotton Campaign[11] member organizations, including two staff members of Human Rights Watch. Early in the morning, a traffic police officer stopped a human rights defender, Arslanbay Utepov, as he was driving to the meeting. The police took Utepov to the local administration, where the authorities held him until the evening, and warned him not to interact with international human rights organizations. The police officers also stopped Zaripbay Reymov, a member and co-founder of Chiroq, on his way to the meeting. The officers seized his phone and took him to a police station, holding him there until the afternoon. On that day, Chiroq\u2019s founder, Guldana Seidemetova, was urgently ordered to come to a clinic where she works \u201cbecause a commission from Tashkent was coming,\u201d but no commission arrived.<\/p> <p>In its Concluding observations on the second periodic report of Uzbekistan in 2014, the Committee called on the Uzbek authorities to repeal \u201cthe mandatory registration requirement for non-governmental organizations and revising national legislation in line with its obligations under article 8 of the Covenant and article 34 of the Constitution of Uzbekistan, which affirms the right of citizens to form their own organizations\u201d[12].<\/p> <p>Since the last review, the government has taken some important steps to ease the registration process regulated by the 2014 Cabinet of Ministers Decree on the procedure for state registration of nongovernmental nonprofit organizations.[13] These steps include significantly reducing[14] the registration fee, cutting[15] the time period for government review of registration documents from two months to one month, and opening[16] a portal that allows submission of applications by nongovernmental groups online. But vague and burdensome rules remain in place.<\/p> <p>In recent years, Uzbek authorities also claim that civil society organizations[17] \u201care becoming a full partner of the state\u201d and that \u201cmeasures are being taken to increase their role and importance\u201d.[18] Yet the Justice Ministry repeatedly denies registration to independent groups on trivial and technical grounds. Without registration, the groups are not permitted to legally work in the country. In April 2021, the Humanitarian Legal Center in Bukhara was denied registration for the ninth time. The volunteer youth group Oltin Qanot (\u201cGolden Wing\u201d) has been denied registration 21 times. In September 2021, after being denied registration for the eighth time, the founders of the rights group Human Rights House filed a lawsuit against the Justice Ministry.<\/p> <p>In October 2019, President Mirziyoyev ordered the establishment of a working group to prepare a new code for nongovernmental groups with the aim of streamlining legislation on civil society and ordered the draft to be submitted for review to the Cabinet of Ministers by February 1, 2020. In January 2020, the draft was finalized, but it failed to eliminate the existing restrictions, according to assessments by local civil society experts. Subsequent deadlines have been missed. Human Rights Watch was not aware of further steps taken to finalize the draft code and it has not been made available to the public.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Fully abolish the practice of forced labor in cotton fields, including by holding accountable local authorities that mobilize state emergency services staff and private sector employees.<\/p> <p>Liberalize registration procedures for NGOs and register independent civil society; organizations, including international human rights groups, and those who have been repeatedly denied registration;<\/p> <p>Stop intervening with the work of civil society organisations aimed at documenting violations of economic, social and cultural rights;<\/p> <p>Provide information on the new code for nongovernmental groups;<\/p> <p>Allow independent trade unions to register and operate without fear of retaliation and uphold commitments to implement ILO Conventions 87 and 98.<\/p> <p>Rehabilitation of former political prisoners (article 6 and 12)<\/p> <p>The Uzbek government has released more than 50 people imprisoned on politically motivated charges, including journalists, human rights defenders, and other activists since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took office in September 2016.[19]<\/p> <p>Released political prisoners face legal and economic barriers following their release, including restrictions on freedom of movement, inability to obtain court decisions needed to appeal unlawful sentences, surveillance, and inadequate medical care for health ailments stemming from their incarceration. Former political prisoners face great difficulties reintegrating into their families and society after years or decades in prison. Many are suffering from severe physical and psychological health problems resulting from years of torture and detention in dismal conditions, often in isolation from other prisoners or in prisons far from their families. Social support structures and services they need are largely non-existent, meaning they must depend on often ill-prepared family members for the support they need.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Ensure former political prisoners receive full legal rehabilitation to enable them to take a full part in society;<\/p> <p>Address the significant medical, mental health, and economic needs of former political prisoners as they attempt to reintegrate into society;<\/p> <p>Ensure their access to adequate and appropriate medical care to treat all health problems linked to their imprisonment.<\/p> <p>Violence against Women (article 10)<\/p> <p>Deep inequality between men and women persists in Uzbekistan. Domestic violence remains a serious problem. In 2014, the Committee called on the Uzbek authorities to criminalise domestic violence and adopt the draft law on preventing violence against women.[20] To this day, neither domestic violence nor marital rape are explicitly criminalized, and the draft Criminal Code, published in February 2021, did not include a standalone offence of domestic violence. Between January and March 2021, the Internal Affairs Ministry registered 11,070 complaints of harassment and violence against women. While the State Commission on Gender Equality reported in 2019 that it had opened 197 rehabilitation and adaptation centers for women who experience violence, a June 2020 media report found that many such centers \u201cdid not exist\u201d or \u201cdid not function\u201d as intended.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it call upon the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Urgently introduce criminal provisions to ensure domestic violence is a stand-alone crime and subject to public prosecution and appropriate punishments commensurate with the gravity of the abuse;<\/p> <p>Ensure that survivors of domestic abuse have immediate and straightforward access to protection, including through ensuring sufficient shelter spaces, including in rural areas.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3UAU495MIK7XERR6I83G0Z94YE7UOS"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":586,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Uzbekistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"homosexual men, LGBT, anal exams, sexual orientation, gender identity","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"forced labor, trade unions, NGOs","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil rights, political prisoners, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Uzbekistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"homosexual men, LGBT, anal exams, sexual orientation, gender identity","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"forced labor, trade unions, NGOs","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil rights, political prisoners, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":932980016,"Input.title":"Reps move to rescue Buratai\u2019s critic in military detention","Input.publish_date":"2020-07-03 04:29:48","Input.article_interface":"<p>Leke Baiyewu and Samson Folarin<\/p> <p>The House of Representatives has begun the process to rescue a soldier, Lance Corporal Martins Idakpein, who was detained for criticising the service chiefs over the rising spate of insecurity in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>At the plenary on Thursday, the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, moved a motion to call for Idakpein\u2019s rescue.<\/p> <p>It was titled, \u2018A Call on the Nigerian Army to Release Lance Corporal Martins Idakpein from Arrest on the Basis of His Expressed Opinion.\u2019<\/p> <p>ldakpein, from the 8 Division, Sokoto of the Nigerian Army, had criticised the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.

At the time, Shehbaz Sharif took notice of the report, commenting that Pakistan would lose its GSP-Plus trading status with the EU and deter other foreign investment if it did not improve the environment for the press.<\/p> <p>This is hardly the resounding, principled defence of media freedom that one would want from political leaders who are fashioning themselves as the saviours of Pakistani democracy. But it is the type of practical assessment that may spur meaningful action from a politician known for pragmatism and outcomes. And after the three-and-a-half-year battering that the press has endured during Imran Khan\u2019s tenure, any steps towards improved media freedom \u2014 irrespective of what motivates them \u2014 should be welcomed. But is the younger Sharif ready to take them?<\/p> <p>The clampdown on media is among the darkest aspects of Khan\u2019s legacy. Pakistan slipped by six points to 145th position in the World Press Freedom Index 2021. During Khan\u2019s tenure, the media was stripped of freedom and funding. Journalists were harassed, abducted and tortured. News outlets were denied advertising revenue or blocked outright. The PTI government also worked hard (though mercifully failed) to centralise media control through a proposed Pakistan Media Development Authority, which would have had the power to shut down any news outlet, without offering any notice or justification, or being subject to legal challenge.<\/p> <p>The most absurd demonstration of the PTI government\u2019s disdain for the press was the passage of the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021, long sought as a way to offer some recourse for journalists under threat. Section 6 of that bill undermined the legislation entirely, as it prohibited media workers from spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d, advocating hatred or inciting violence. The vague wording of the section was widely perceived as an attempt by the government to muzzle journalists, empowering the state to label all critical reporting as fake news.<\/p> <p>Will the new set-up defend press freedom?<\/p> <p>The recent political turbulence has eased pressure on the press. As institutions have been embroiled in power tussles, journalists have noted a slowdown in directives, less harassment, and increased opportunities for critical reporting. How long will this last? What can one expect from a PML-N-led coalition, given the party\u2019s own sordid history with the press, from Najam Sethi\u2019s 1999 arrest on trumped-up treason charges to the passage in 2015 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, which enabled a crackdown on online free speech?<\/p> <p>Restoring a modicum of press freedom should be a no-brainer for the coalition government. This should include an easing off on news outlets as well as concrete acts such as the removal of Section 6 from the journalists\u2019 protection legislation and increasing government advertising budgets for news outlets. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has already demanded as much from Sharif.<\/p> <p>Such steps would quickly demonstrate that the Sharif-led coalition government is truly committed to the democratic values it championed during the no-confidence vote, and that it intends to approach governance in a radically different way from Khan. It would also change the growing public perception that all our political leaders are merely puppets, caught in an endless game of musical chairs, and give hope that genuine democratic progress is possible.<\/p> <p>The coalition parties under Sharif have a choice to make. They can either sink to Khan\u2019s level and play his dangerous games, or they can learn from their experience as an embattled opposition \u2014 as well as from the resilience of our Constitution as demonstrated by recent events \u2014 and do things differently, better. This choice will apply across all areas of governance, but also in how they approach the media.<\/p> <p>The recent arrests by the FIA of PTI social media activists on charges of smearing the army and judiciary and the suspension of thousands of PTI-linked social media accounts are tactics from PTI\u2019s censorship and intimidation book. As the battle of narratives between Khan and the military over Cable\u00adgate escalates, we\u2019re likely to see the establishment resort to various means to prevent the armed forces from being publicly mali\u00adgned. This may include pressure on the media to promote one narrative over the other, including through undemocratic means such as media blackouts of PTI rallies.<\/p> <p>The new government must work hard to prevent this. Such a crackdown will further rile PTI ranks, and give their conspiracies and victimhood narratives more power. It will also confirm to those who had serious reservations about Khan\u2019s ruling tactics that the alternatives are not much better.

On Sunday October 4, 1936, thousands of members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Moseley organized a march through London\u2019s East End with the intent to commit horrific violence towards London\u2019s Jewish community, which at that time predominantly lived in that area. However, the Jewish community knew an attack might be coming, so the Jewish People\u2019s Council against Fascism and Antisemitism organized a demonstration with Irish dockworkers, socialists, trade unionists, and communists to fight against the fascist attack.<\/p> <p>As the fascists ascended to Cable Street they were also guided by thousands of police officers, who were more than eager to protect them against those the state considered less than desirable. However, they were hit by a roadblock when they were met by the 20,000 strong anti fascist contingency who fought back against the fascist force with anything they could get their hands on, they eventually succeeded in getting Moseley to call his utterly demoralized Blackshirts to retreat. For one day the Jewish community of London could rest, knowing they and their fellow antifascists were able to defeat the fascists and protect the East End from a pogrom.<\/p> <p>For one day.<\/p> <p>This memory of Cable Street has remained in our memory because it serves as a reminder of the narrative Britain has served to establish itself during WWII, a plucky force of people who through resiliency stood together to defeat fascism.<\/p> <p>The reality however, is far more disturbing.<\/p> <p>Because the Battle of Cable Street was just a battle, and the fascists did not suddenly go away. In fact, they had only grown stronger, they had recruited over 2,000 new members. On October 10th, as antifascist demonstrators were marching and celebrating their victory they were greeted by a mass of people \u201cgesturing and screaming \u201cthe Yids, the Yids, we\u2019ve got to get rid of the Yids\u201d. At the corner of Bethnal Green and Roman Road, a double wall of police held back hundreds of young men and women shouting, \u201cup the fascism, dirty Yids\u201d.<\/p> <p>As the fascists were violently clashing with the protesters, this was only meant to serve as a deterrent to the real attack. The rest of the Blackshirts stormed into the East End and attacked Jewish shops and businesses with anything they could get their hands on. Jews were physically thrown out of the windows of their shops, and cars were set ablaze. This became known as the Mile End Pogrom. It was a scene that would not have been out of place in Nazi Germany. One shopkeeper voiced the community\u2019s fears when he said, \u201cI fear this is only the beginning.\u201d For as Hitler\u2019s bombs poured down on London, the Jews of the East End soon faced a new threat in the malice of Winston Churchill.<\/p> <p>While not as genocidal as his views towards colonized people, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, Winston Churchill held deeply antisemitic views which were exacerbated by his longtime support for the Zionist colonial project. As Home Secretary in 1911, Churchill was present at the Battle of Stepney, an armed confrontation between police and Lativan revolutionaries, these revolutionaries were rumored to be Jewish and this influenced Churchill to strengthen the Aliens Act, which would have severely further restricted Jewish refugees from entering the UK.<\/p> <p>The Aliens Act of 1905 was one of the first acts restricting immigration in the UK and it was primarily advocated by the PM at the time Arthur Balfour as an attempt to institute restrictions on Jewish refugees fleeing pogroms in the Russian Empire. Balfour was a notorious antisemite, who later would issue the Balfour Declaration, expressing support for a Jewish state in Palestine. This contradiction was not lost on Britain\u2019s Jews at the time who saw Zionism as a clear attempt to get rid of all Jews on the European continent. For Balfour especially, it also served as a way to propagate his Christian end times theorist desires. It was particularly evident from the very start that Zionism required the support of antisemites for the establishment of their settler colonial state.<\/p> <p>Churchill himself was an ardent Zionist throughout his life, and his term as Home Secretary was not the only time he expressed antisemitic views. He openly propagated Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy theories, and in 1920 he claimed that \u200b\u200b\u201dinternational Jews\u201d were leading a \u201cworld-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation\u201d. Additionally, in 1937 he wrote a paper criticizing the \u201caloofness\u201d and \u201cseparation\u201d of Jews from wider society, and claimed they were \u201cpartly responsible for the antagonism for which they suffer.\u201d<\/p> <p>This culminated when during the London Blitz of 1940-1941, as German bombs were raining down on London, Churchill intentionally left the East End to fend for themselves. Because the East End was predominantly filled with Jews and other immigrants, there was less of a priority to provide them with adequate shelters. In fact, these were the areas which did end up with too few shelters, as after six weeks of bombing a quarter of a million people in the East End had lost their homes and were without shelter. They were forced to resort to using tube stations for shelter, for which 100-150,000 used on any given night.<\/p> <p>The Jewish community of England continued to be terrorized by fascists for years after Cable Street and again by another significant resurgence of Nazism during the 1960\u2019s with Colin Jordan\u2019s National Socialist Movement.<\/p> <p>While Nazism and antisemitism has never truly died out in London\u2013 just as with the rest of Europe, England is inherently built on antisemitism and the persecution of Jews. Still white Jews were able to eventually assimilate into further benefiting from a white supremacist system, especially as more grew to adopt colonialist Zionist views. As the Windrush Generation and other immigrants of color from the former British Empire immigrated to England, they became a more visible target within a country structurally built on white supremacy and colonialism.<\/p> <p>Less than a mile away from Cable Street lies the Altab Ali Park, named in memory of Altab Ali, a Bangladeshi textile worker who was brutally stabbed to death in 1978 by white supremacists, a stark reminder that fascism did not die with Cable Street.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3R16PJFTS56F72CC5AK5GEU1FWA4KW"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":456,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["other"],"year":"1936","month":"October","date":"4.0","city":"London","region":"None","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"England, Jews, Cable Street","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Altab Ali","victim_keywords":"Bangladeshi, textile worker, England, stabbing","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["other"],"year":"1936","month":"October","date":"4.0","city":"London","region":"None","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"England, Jews, Cable Street","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Altab Ali","victim_keywords":"Bangladeshi, textile worker, England, stabbing","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":924601877,"Input.title":"Stop the US government\u2019s $2-B arms sale to the Philippines","Input.publish_date":"2020-05-20 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, the U.S. government is brokering a $2 billion arms sale to Duterte\u2019s repressive regime, fueling a human rights catastrophe.<\/p> <p>By AMEE CHEW<\/p> <p>Bulatlat.com<\/p> <p>On April 30, the U.S. State Department announced two pending arms sales to the Philippines totaling nearly $2 billion.

Meanwhile, a teacher was arrested simply for posting \u201cprovoking\u201d comments on social media that decried the lack of government relief, while an artist was detained two nights without a warrant for a sarcastic post on COVID-19.<\/p> <p>Mutual aid, solidarity, and resistance<\/p> <p>In the face of widespread hunger, inadequate health care, and lethal repression, vibrant grassroots social movement organizations have created mutual aid and relief initiatives providing food, masks, and medical supplies to the poor.<\/p> <p>Cure Covid, a network of volunteers across myriad organizations in the greater Metro Manila region, has organized relief packs and community kitchens for thousands, while engaging in community organizing to strengthen mutual aid. Movement organizers are calling for mass testing, basic services, and an end to the militarized COVID-19 response.<\/p> <p>Kadamay is a mass-based organization of 200,000 urban poor people across the Philippines that has been at the forefront of resisting Duterte\u2019s drug war and reclaiming vacant housing for homeless people. In 2017, Kadamay led 12,000 homeless people in occupying 6,000 vacant homes that had been set aside for the police and military in Pandi, Bulacan. Despite repression and intimidation, #OccupyBulacan continues to this day.<\/p> <p>With COVID-19, Kadamay has led mutual aid efforts and #ProtestFromHome pot-banging actions, with video disseminated on social media, to demand relief and health services, not militarization. In immediate reprisal for voicing dissent after one pot-banging, the national spokesperson of Kadamay, Mimi Doringo, was threatened with arrest. In Bulacan, a community leader was taken to a military encampment and told to cease all political activity and \u201csurrender\u201d to the government or he would get no relief aid.<\/p> <p>Efforts at mutual aid are being criminalized and targeted for repression. Since late April, police have carried out mass arrests of relief volunteers, alongside street vendors and those seeking food. On April 19, seven relief volunteers from Sagip Kanayunan were detained while on their way to distribute food in Bulacan, and later charged with inciting \u201csedition.\u201d On April 24, 50 urban poor residents in Quezon City, including a relief volunteer, were detained for not carrying quarantine passes or wearing face masks. On May 1, ten volunteers conducting relief with the women\u2019s organization Gabriela were arrested while conducting a community feeding in Marikina City.<\/p> <p>This targeting is no accident. Since 2018, an executive order by Duterte has authorized a \u201cwhole-of-nation approach\u201d to counterinsurgency, through a broad array of government agencies, resulting in increased repression against community organizers and human rights defenders generally.<\/p> <p>The crackdowns against mutual aid and survival have prompted campaigns on social media to \u201cstop criminalizing care and community.\u201d Save San Roque, a network supporting the resistance of urban poor residents against demolition, has started a petition to immediately release relief volunteers and all low-level quarantine violators. Human rights organizations are also petitioning for the release of political prisoners, many of them low-income farmers, trade unionists, and human rights defenders facing trumped up charges, including the elderly and ill.<\/p> <p>As a direct result of the government response focused on militarization, rather than adequate health care, food, and services, the Philippines has among the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia, and the pandemic is quickly worsening.<\/p> <p>Colonial roots<\/p> <p>Today\u2019s U.S.-Philippine military alliance has its roots in the U.S. colonization and occupation of the Philippines over a hundred years ago.<\/p> <p>Despite granting the Philippines independence in 1946, the U.S. has used unequal trade agreements and its military presence to maintain the Philippines\u2019 neocolonial status ever since. For decades, propping up oligarchic rulers and preventing land reform guaranteed the U.S. cheap agricultural exports. The U.S. military assisted with countering a string of continual rebellions.<\/p> <p>U.S. military aid still continues to facilitate corporate extraction of Philippine natural resources, real estate monopoly, and repression of indigenous and peasant struggles for land rights \u2014 particularly in Mindanao, a hotbed of communist, indigenous, and Muslim separatist resistance and the recent center of military operations.<\/p> <p>The Philippine armed forces are focused on domestic counterinsurgency, overwhelmingly directing violence against poor and marginalized people within the country\u2019s own borders. Philippine military and police operations are closely intertwined. In fact, historically the Philippine police developed out of counter-insurgency operations during U.S. colonial rule.<\/p> <p>The U.S. military itself maintains a troop presence in the Philippines through its Operation Pacific Eagle and other exercises.<\/p> <p>In the name of \u201ccounterterrorism,\u201d U.S. military aid is helping Duterte wage war on Philippine soil and repress civilian dissent. Since 2017, Duterte has imposed martial law on Mindanao, where he has repeatedly dropped bombs. Military attacks have displaced over 450,000 civilians.<\/p> <p>Carried out with U.S. backing and even joint activities, Duterte\u2019s military operations are shoring up the corporate land-grabbing of indigenous lands and massacres of farmers organizing for their land rights. Paramilitaries backed by the armed forces are terrorizing indigenous communities, targeting schools and teachers.<\/p> <p>In February, prior to the announced arms deal, Duterte nominally rescinded the U.S.-Philippines Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which allows U.S. troops to be stationed in the Philippines for \u201cjoint exercises.\u201d On the surface, this was in response to the U.S. denying a visa to former drug war police chief Ronald \u201cBato\u201d Dela Rosa. However, Duterte\u2019s revocation of the VFA is not immediately effective, and only begins a 6-month process of renegotiation.<\/p> <p>The proposed arms sale signals that Trump intends to strengthen his military backing for Duterte. The Pentagon seeks to maintain a close military \u201cpartnership.\u201d<\/p> <p>End U.S. military aid<\/p> <p>A growing international movement, in solidarity with indigenous and Filipino communities, is calling for an end to military aid to the Philippines. U.S. direct military aid to Duterte\u2019s regime totaled over $193.5 million in 2018, not counting pre-allocated amounts and donated weapons of unreported worth. Military aid also consists of grants to purchase arms, usually from U.S. contractors.<\/p> <p>Relatedly, the U.S. government regulates the flow of private arms sales abroad \u2014 such as the current proposed sale. Sales brokered by the U.S. government are often a public subsidy to private contractors, using our U.S. tax dollars to complete the purchase. Congress must use its power to cut the pending sale off.<\/p> <p>The latest proposed $2 billion arms sale includes 12 attack helicopters, hundreds of missiles and warheads, guidance and detection systems, machine guns, and over 80,000 rounds of ammunition. The State Department says these, too, would be used for \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d \u2014 i.e., repression in the Philippines. Due to lack of transparency and Duterte\u2019s deliberate efforts to obscure aid flows, U.S. military aid may well end up providing ammunition to the armed forces waging Duterte\u2019s drug war, to vigilantes, or to paramilitaries, all without public scrutiny.<\/p> <p>Duterte is using the pandemic as a pretext to continue crushing political opposition. He has now assumed special emergency powers. Even prior to the pandemic, in October 2019, police and military raided the offices of Gabriela, opposition party Bayan Muna, and the National Federation of Sugar Workers, arresting over 57 people in Bacolod City and Metro Manila in one sweep.<\/p> <p>Tragically, repression is quickly escalating.<\/p> <p>On April 30, after weeks of police intimidation for conducting feeding programs, Jory Porquia, a founding member of Bayan Muna, was assassinated inside his home in Iloilo. Over 76 protesters and relief workers were illegally arrested on May Day, including four youth feeding program volunteers in Quezon City, four residents who posted online photos of their \u201cprotesting from home\u201d in Valenzuela, two unionists holding placards in Rizal, and 42 people conducting a vigil for slain human rights defender Porquia in Iloilo. Sixteen workers in a Coca-Cola factory in Laguna were abducted and forced by the military to \u201csurrender\u201d posing as armed insurgents.<\/p> <p>The U.S.\u2019s war machine profits its private contractors at our expense. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing relied on the Pentagon for a third of its income. In April, Boeing received a bailout of $882 million to restart a paused Air Force contract \u2014 for refueling aircraft that are in fact, defective. But for-profit weapons manufacturers and other war profiteers should have no place steering our foreign policy.<\/p> <p>Congress has the power to dissent but must act swiftly. Rep. Ilhan Omar has introduced a bill to stop arming human rights abusers such as Duterte. This month, the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines, Communications Workers of America, and others, will launch a bill specifically to end military aid to the Philippines. In the meantime, we must urge Congress to stop the proposed arms sales to the Philippines: please sign this petition to do so.<\/p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is baring the need for global solidarity against militarization and austerity. In taking up the fight against the deep footprint of U.S. imperialism, here and abroad, our movements will make each other stronger.<\/p> <p>*The author has a doctorate in American Studies and Ethnicity and is a Mellon-ACLS Public Fellow.

I came from a poor family so I identified with them,\u201d he said, sitting across his furniture shop in Kadipur village in Nadia district, about 120 kilometres (74 miles) northeast of state capital, Kolkata.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo many years have gone by, but I am still poor.

I had to join them for survival in 2014. There are many like me,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>As West Bengal goes through another election, the trend of left workers and voters deserting the party to join the Hindu nationalist BJP continues to be seen across the state \u2013 a phenomenon locally described as \u201cVaam se Ram\u201d (From the left to Hindu god Ram).<\/p> <p>The reasons behind the trend are multifold: desperation to protect themselves from attacks by TMC workers; fatigue after decades of CPM dominance; little potential for growth in a party seen as redundant; and, most importantly, the Hindu supremacist campaign run by the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in the state.<\/p> <p>Inspired by the rise of Nazism in Europe, the RSS was formed in 1925 and aims to create an ethnic Hindu state in India by denying other minorities, mainly Muslims, their political rights.<\/p> <p>After their induction into the BJP, many former CPM workers Al Jazeera talked to in West Bengal said they undertook a training programme conducted by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a far-right RSS affiliate accused of attacking Muslims and Christians across the country, to help them make the ideological shift.<\/p> <p>The fresh BJP recruits said they were told by the VHP about the importance of \u201cprioritising Hindus\u201d and how Muslims were involved in the smuggling of cows, which many Hindus consider sacred.<\/p> <p>Somen Ghosh, 33, used to be a prominent activist with the CPM\u2019s student body in Krishnaganj.

I need to think about me and my family\u2019s safety.\u201d<\/p> <p>West Bengal opposition leaders and voters were often attacked or threatened by CPM workers during their long rule.<\/p> <p>\u201cMamata Banerjee was one of them,\u201d said Mohammad Reyaz, a Kolkata-based academic and political commentator.<\/p> <p>\u201cTherefore, when she came to power, she did not allow any opposition to thrive. There are villages in Bengal where CPM offices were never allowed to open after 2011. The BJP provided an alternative to the CPM cadre and voters being pushed to the margins.\u201d<\/p> <p>Election data supports Reyaz\u2019s claim. Between the state polls in 2016 and the national election in 2019, the CPM\u2019s vote share in West Bengal dwindled from 26.6 percent to 7.5 percent. At the same time, the BJP\u2019s vote share rose from 10.16 percent to 40.7 percent.<\/p> <p>The Jangalmahal region, once a left-wing bastion with a large tribal population and one of the state\u2019s most underdeveloped areas, has seen an overwhelming shift to the BJP since 2009.<\/p> <p>Jangalmahal consists of six West Bengal districts \u2013 Purulia, West Bardhaman, Bankura, Birbhum, Jhargram and West Medinipur \u2013 and shares the state\u2019s western border with neighbouring Odisha and Jharkhand states.<\/p> <p>BJP, which had little electoral presence in this region, has virtually wiped out CPM now.<\/p> <p>The left workers think they can enable the vote share of BJP and then get it back once the TMC is out of the way. But it does not work like that. by Ayesha Khatun, left politician<\/p> <p>Kalicharan Shaw, who works for the BJP\u2019s media cell in West Bengal, said the shift from left to right in West Bengal has little to do with ideology.<\/p> <p>\u201cIdeology largely works with the urban, elite electorate, which is still voting for the left,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation in rural areas is different. For them, representation matters.\u201d<\/p> <p>Shaw said the left had West Bengal for 34 years but the party was \u201cdominated by upper castes\u201d among the Hindus.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe state has a significant population of scheduled castes, backward castes and scheduled tribes. They are our biggest vote bank because the left never nurtured or produced a leader from these communities,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Beginning of end<\/p> <p>The tectonic shift away from the left, however, came in 2007 at Nandigram, a town 130 kilometres (81 miles) south of Kolkata, when the government led by Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wanted to acquire farmland to develop a special economic zone.<\/p> <p>But the farmers, backed by opposition leaders, protested the acquisition. To break up the agitation, left-wing cadres allegedly attacked the site. Official records showed 14 deaths, but more than 100 people were said to be missing. Allegations of rape were also made.<\/p> <p>The Nandigram incident marked the beginning of the end for the left in West Bengal. In the last national election held in 2019, it drew a blank. In 2014, it won just two out of 42 seats.<\/p> <p>However, Mohammad Salim, a senior CPM leader, said the situation in West Bengal has changed in the past two years.<\/p> <p>\u201cDuring the coronavirus-induced lockdown, TMC and BJP were nowhere to be seen,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe were in the streets, fighting for those struggling with economic hardships.\u201d<\/p> <p>Salim said the CPM is still raising the issues of students, women and farmers in the current election. \u201cBut the media is ignoring it. We have analysed our failures and you will see a rejuvenated CPM in the upcoming elections,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>On the ground, though, the reality appears to be different. For a party that dominated the Jangalmahal region for years, its presence today is strikingly underwhelming as flags and posters of other political parties drown out the CPM campaign.<\/p> <p>At a brick kiln in one of the remote villages of Purulia district, none of the labourers Al Jazeera talked to said they would vote for the CPM.<\/p> <p>Sadanand Singh, 37, and his wife Dipali, 28, toiling in the twilight in Dabra village, said their families traditionally voted for the CPM, but the next generation has moved away.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe condition of workers like me did not change much,\u201d said Sadanand. \u201cWhen TMC came around, we gave them a chance. But that party also turned out to be disappointing. Now, we have a new option in BJP. We should try that out too.\u201d<\/p> <p>The prospects of a rising BJP, which had little say in West Bengal until 2016, has made several West Bengal observers nervous.

We\u2019re going to be discussing the Pegasus Scandal.<\/p> <p>I make an effort to avoid the news for mental health reasons, but given my profession, I couldn\u2019t escape the news of this story. It was trending on news sites around the world.<\/p> <p>Despite the popularity of this story, I have found it difficult to find a simple and thorough explanation of the details of the Pegasus Scandal. Which is why I\u2019m writing to you today.<\/p> <p>In this post, I\u2019m going to cover everything you need to know about this incident in terms that are easy to understand, even if you don\u2019t know much about tech. I\u2019ll also be going into a bit of history on this issue as well as the picture it paints for our future.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the facts you need to know first.<\/p> <p>The Pegasus Scandal: The basics<\/p> <p>For the first half of this article, I\u2019m just going to cover the critical facts of this story. If you don\u2019t know anything about this scandal, this is a good place to start.<\/p> <p>What is the Pegasus Scandal?<\/p> <p>The Pegasus Scandal is the name being given to one of the scariest cybersecurity breaches of our time. \u201cPegasus\u201d is the name of malware developed by a group known as \u201cNSO\u201d.<\/p> <p>Pegasus is capable of infecting any major smartphone device of today. That includes the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 as well as most Android smartphones.<\/p> <p>Once a device has been infected, Pegasus gains access to root permissions for that device. For those that don\u2019t know, root permissions refer to deep administrative control of a device. That includes cameras, microphones, messaging apps, emails, photos and videos, phone calls, contacts, calendars, and GPS data.<\/p> <p>In other words, root permissions give software access to everything. Ideally, the only software on your iPhone that has access to root permissions is iOS itself. And the only person who can act on those permissions is you and (on rare occasions like iPhone repairs) Apple.<\/p> <p>In this case, though, Pegasus was able to access and use (and did use) all of these root permissions to spy on users.<\/p> <p>I normally try to avoid negativity, but it can\u2019t get too much more serious than this. Imagine all of your worst fears about being spied on by your device, and that\u2019s basically what Pegasus has been able to accomplish.<\/p> <p>Did Apple, Google, and others intentionally participate in the Pegasus Scandal?<\/p> <p>No, Apple, Google, and other device manufacturers did not knowingly participate in the Pegasus Scandal. At least not as far as we know.<\/p> <p>Based on the best investigative journalism being conducted at this time, it doesn\u2019t look like any of these major tech companies had anything to do with this. If anything, these companies have been completely turned upside down by this news.<\/p> <p>Hopefully, the engineers at these businesses are working night and day to stop Pegasus in its tracks as well as prevent future attacks like it.<\/p> <p>Not only did Apple and others not participate in this, but Apple has made statements disavowing these attacks and asserting that the iPhone is still the most secure mobile device on the market.<\/p> <p>To be fair, the iPhone probably is still the most secure smartphone out there. But as we\u2019ve learned, that might not be enough anymore. I\u2019ll get into this further in the article.<\/p> <p>Who is at risk?<\/p> <p>The one inkling of good news surrounding the Pegasus Scandal (aside from the fact that the story broke at all) is that you probably aren\u2019t at risk. This software was developed for government use, which means that it\u2019s primarily targeting individuals in positions of political power.<\/p> <p>You should be personally concerned about the effects of Pegasus (regardless of nationality) if you:<\/p> <p>Hold a political office<\/p> <p>Are a journalist (especially a political one)<\/p> <p>Hold political influence<\/p> <p>Are a member of a military<\/p> <p>Work for a government (especially with access to sensitive information or permissions)<\/p> <p>The data that was uncovered and leaked by the journalists who investigated this story (I\u2019ll go into more detail on them later) shows roughly 50,000 individuals who were affected by this scandal.<\/p> <p>To give you an idea of the severity of the individuals targeted, French President Emmanuel Macron was successfully targeted by Pegasus. He has since changed his phone.<\/p> <p>You are probably safe<\/p> <p>For now, this seems to indicate that the vast majority of people around the world are safe from Pegasus software. I\u2019m sure that more than 50,000 people were affected. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be an indication of mass civilian surveillance in this specific case.<\/p> <p>That said, I would not advise you to relax and forget this story altogether. Although you most likely haven\u2019t been affected, the ramifications of this could certainly have an impact on your life.<\/p> <p>This software (or another like it) could at a later point in history be deployed at the civilian level en masse. Or one of your political leaders could be targeted, which could impact your national security.<\/p> <p>Either way, this is big news for everyone around the world. Pegasus is a few years ahead of leading cybersecurity defenses. Until we catch up, this attack and others like it pose a serious threat.<\/p> <p>You probably won\u2019t know if your device is infected<\/p> <p>One of the most concerning aspects of the Pegasus Scandal is how difficult it is to learn who is and isn\u2019t infected. Journalists were able to provide a list of affected parties by finding and leaking lists of targets over time. However, they were not able to find a way to detect Pegasus malware on a person\u2019s device.<\/p> <p>In other words, we have an idea of who was infected because lists of names have been uncovered. This scandal was not exposed, however, by finding the malware on mobile devices.<\/p> <p>An example that counters this is the Silver Sparrow malware, which was found oppositely. We were able to find it on Mac devices, but it was never discovered where it came from or why it was used.<\/p> <p>For now, there is little to no way to confirm or deny the presence of Pegasus on your device. Again, it is extremely unlikely that your device has been affected. If you have reason to believe you may be at risk, though (i.e., you\u2019re a member of one of the targeted groups I covered earlier) then it might be worth purchasing a new iPhone and getting rid of your current device completely.<\/p> <p>How the Pegasus malware works<\/p> <p>Pegasus malware is what\u2019s known as a \u201czero-click\u201d attack. That means that the user of the targeted device doesn\u2019t have to do anything to be infected. It can compromise your device without any malicious links, popups, or other deceptive methods. It\u2019s simply sent to a device, and shortly after, the device is infected.<\/p> <p>From what we know so far, it looks like Pegasus is sent to devices one of two ways.<\/p> <p>The first is by sending a link to the user via email, text message, or instant messaging (i.e., WhatsApp). Once the user clicks on the link, the infection process begins. In this instance, the attack would not technically be \u201czero-click\u201d.<\/p> <p>The second method uses vulnerabilities in common apps. This includes both common third-party apps (like WhatsApp) as well as built-in apps like Apple Music and Photos. While specific details haven\u2019t been uncovered (or released to the public), it was discovered that suspicious activity occurred in both Apple Music and Photos shortly before Pegasus was able to infect the system.<\/p> <p>How zero-day vulnerabilities work<\/p> <p>It is believed that Pegasus was able to infect iPhones through built-in iOS apps by looking for \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities. A zero-day vulnerability is when a hacker starts brute-forcing different attacks on software as soon as it\u2019s released. That way, the hacker can find a vulnerability before the developer can and exploit it.<\/p> <p>Put simply, when Apple releases a new version of iOS (even an incremental update like iOS 14.7) there is almost always an unforeseen vulnerability. After a few days or weeks, that vulnerability will be uncovered, and before any hackers can exploit it, Apple will release a new update that removes this vulnerability. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll sometimes get back-to-back iOS updates.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, there are some groups (including Pegasus\u2019s developer NSO) who have the resources and motivations to uncover a vulnerability on the same day that the software is released.<\/p> <p>So they find the vulnerability, modify Pegasus to exploit that vulnerability, then send Pegasus to the victim. By the time Apple finds and patches the vulnerability, the device is already infected, so the patch is ineffective for that user and other victims.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that most of the vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s software are inevitable. In the same way that it\u2019s impossible to build a pick-proof lock, there is no way for Apple to release a version of iOS that is completely unhackable.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s why iPhone is considered the \u201cmost secure\u201d and not the \u201ccompletely secure\u201d smartphone. So Apple and co are deserving of a modicum of lenience along with the (appropriately directed) criticism.<\/p> <p>Some background on Pegasus developer NSO<\/p> <p>Those are all of the details that you need to know. Now we\u2019re going to get into some finer points as well as discussions on the impact of the Pegasus Scandal. First, let\u2019s explore NSO.<\/p> <p>As mentioned, NSO is the group that developed the Pegasus malware. They\u2019re based in Israel and have been working on tech like this since the 2010s, which is right around the time that smartphones shifted from a novelty to a necessity.<\/p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the recent story on Pegasus is not the first time that NSO has gotten into hot water. Its entire history is filled with controversy and, arguably, crime. Here are some of the \u201csmaller\u201d issues surrounding NSO:<\/p> <p>In 2012, the Mexican government hired NSO to help it keep tabs on journalists and human rights activists in Mexico (source)<\/p> <p>In 2018, NSO was accused of helping the Saudi Arabian government spy on human rights group Amnesty International (source)<\/p> <p>Despite NSO\u2019s Pegasus malware being intended exclusively for use by governments, one of NSO\u2019s staff attempted to sell the software online in exchange for cryptocurrency, highlighting the possibility of Pegasus falling into the wrong hands (of course, it\u2019s debatable whether or not there even are \u201cright hands\u201d for Pegasus to fall into) (source)<\/p> <p>Other scandals have followed NSO<\/p> <p>Larger scandals have plagued NSO, too. It has been sued by Facebook-owned WhatsApp for injecting its spyware on the devices of WhatsApp users via the WhatsApp platform (source). The alleged attack affected 1,400 users across 20 countries.<\/p> <p>Among those users were (you guessed it) numerous journalists and human rights defenders. WhatsApp also claimed to have discovered that these attacks originated from NSO servers. If true, that would seem to indicate that NSO directly used Pegasus to infect these users, not one of NSO\u2019s clients\/customers.<\/p> <p>It is also alleged that the Pegasus software was used to track Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi Arabian government in the months preceding his murder (source). For everyone who remembers, this was an internationally devastating crime. Seeing Pegasus linked to it is no small matter.<\/p> <p>In short, NSO has been developing the Pegasus surveillance software for the Israeli government over the last decade. The software hasn\u2019t just been used by Israel, however. The Israeli government has been licensing the software to other governments, who have largely been using it to stifle and remove journalists, activists, and human rights defenders.<\/p> <p>Put another way, NSO appears to be, by all accounts, a perpetrator of dystopian tactics. This may be its biggest scandal yet, but it is by no means an outlier in the group\u2019s history.<\/p> <p>NSO is refuting claims about its Pegasus software<\/p> <p>To nobody\u2019s surprise, NSO is refuting the claims surrounding the Pegasus Scandal.<\/p> <p>Which claims is it refuting? Specifics haven\u2019t been named. The group\u2019s lawyers have simply disavowed the ramifications of its software without discussing specific allegations.<\/p> <p>All NSO\u2019s lawyers have said so far is that the claims made by the journalists who uncovered and leaked this information are \u201ca compilation of speculative and baseless assumptions.\u201d<\/p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that when faced with the allegations surrounding WhatsApp, all NSO had to say was that, \u201cNSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients.\u201d In other words, all it had to say on the matter was that what its customers do with its software isn\u2019t its business.<\/p> <p>So it looks like NSO is sticking with the tried-and-true \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, and even if I did, it\u2019s not my fault\u201d defense.<\/p> <p>Apple\u2019s security and privacy claims have forever been called into question<\/p> <p>I mentioned earlier that I think Apple, Google, and others deserve a bit of leniency when it comes to these sorts of attacks. After all, they are, to a certain extent, inevitable.<\/p> <p>Apple doesn\u2019t have the power to stop global government-funded organizations from wedging surveillance malware through iOS updates. If Apple could create a hack-proof version of iOS, I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve done it already.<\/p> <p>That said, I would not argue that Apple and company are exempt from criticism. I\u2019ve been covering privacy on AppleToolBox and other websites for a long time because it\u2019s arguably the most important challenge facing tech today. And for a long time, Apple has been the best mainstream tech company at preventing these kinds of scandals.<\/p> <p>Seeing how effective and widespread the Pegasus Scandal is brings new points into the privacy discussion.<\/p> <p>First, to what extent is Apple responsible? Should it change the way it manufactures its devices and software, and if so, how?<\/p> <p>Second, it\u2019s safe to say that for all of Apple\u2019s best efforts and marketing slogans, your iPhone isn\u2019t bulletproof. The only way to truly avoid surveillance is to remain a nobody and\/or live isolated from modern technology.<\/p> <p>Third, it highlights how unerringly important it is for political officials to wake up and get educated on cybersecurity and tech issues. While some promising progress is beginning to happen (read here), it\u2019s too slow. New regulations, innovations, and defenses at the administrative level are needed to help stave off the growing threat of cyberattacks.<\/p> <p>The origin of groups like the NSO<\/p> <p>The NSO seems to be the most pressing threat to our digital security and privacy for at least the last ten years. It\u2019s too much power in too many hands, all of which seem to be the worst hands available.<\/p> <p>In the same way that the U.S. government deserves criticism when it sells weapons to bad actors, the Israeli government should be held accountable for where and how Pegasus is distributed, assuming it should even be allowed to be distributed, to begin with.<\/p> <p>Of course, the Pegasus Scandal is not the first of its kind. Intel and security scandals have plagued the U.S. for the last 50+ years as groups like the FBI, NSA, and CIA have used similar tactics and strategies to target the same groups as Pegasus \u2013 rights activists and journalists.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to think that the origin of groups like NSO began with inspiration from the spying being conducted by the U.S. and U.K. governments. Both countries were shown to be bad actors on this front thanks to the information leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.<\/p> <p>While many of the programs that were unmasked by Edward Snowden have been (at least \u201cofficially\u201d) shutdown, the 2013 leak no doubt inspired countries like Israel and groups like NSO to pursue their ends in this area.<\/p> <p>Similar to how the development of the atom bomb was shortly copied by every other country with the resources to do so, I imagine that there are lots of Pegasus clones that are copying the previous work of the U.S. government.<\/p> <p>How the Pegasus Scandal was uncovered<\/p> <p>The work done to bring the Pegasus Scandal to light is pretty fascinating. It\u2019s certainly one of the most sophisticated instances of investigative journalism that I\u2019ve ever heard of.<\/p> <p>Following the leak of 50,000 phone numbers in 2020 (which were tied to Pegasus), seventeen media publications joined together to investigate NSO and its software. Among these publications are The Guardian, The Washington Post, Le Monde, Proceso, and The Wire.<\/p> <p>In total, 80 journalists from these publications investigated this leak for several months. During that time, these journalists partnered with other investigative and forensic services to identify the phone numbers, search through the devices for malware (when possible), and confirmed that the devices were not only being tracked but being tracked by NSO\u2019s software.<\/p> <p>High-profile individuals from around the world have been targeted, including the President of France Emmanuel Macron, the Prime Minister of Egypt Mostafa Madbouly, and Barham Salih, the President of Iraq.<\/p> <p>As mentioned, a majority of the targeted individuals are journalists and human rights activists. Alongside the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, there are ties between Pegasus and the imprisonment and torture of Saudi women\u2019s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, the assassination of Mexican anti-corruption journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto, and the leaking of intimate photos of Fatima Movlamli (she was 18 at the time that the photos were leaked), an opposer to local authoritarian rule in Azerbaijan.<\/p> <p>The work completed by these journalists is equal parts inspiringly brave and devastatingly eye-opening.<\/p> <p>The future of security and privacy in tech is looking bleak once more<\/p> <p>For the majority of the 2010s, it was generally accepted that our tech was being used to spy on us. This was confirmed by Edward Snowden\u2019s leak in 2013.<\/p> <p>After that leak, however, it seemed that things were steadily improving. Apple and others have taken strong stances on protecting their users\u2019 privacy, and despite cynicism, it has seemed that these companies had put their money where their mouth was.<\/p> <p>Additionally, the U.S. appears to have canceled its previous spying programs, and recent court cases have deemed that the NSA\u2019s surveillance was illegal and potentially unconstitutional.<\/p> <p>But the Pegasus Scandal seems to show that good intentions in one area do not equal good intentions in all areas. The reformation of some bad actors is not equal to the reformation of all bad actors. And it seems like, at least with the state of the world today, that there is little anyone can do about this.<\/p> <p>After all of the journalism conducted on this scandal, it has remained conclusive that if someone wants to use the Pegasus software against you, there isn\u2019t anything you can do to stop them short of isolating yourself from tech.<\/p> <p>The NSO\u2019s excuse for creating and licensing Pegasus<\/p> <p>According to NSO, the Pegasus software is only meant to be used against terrorist organizations. NSO claims that it vets potential governments before licensing the software to them to reduce the chances that they will use it for ill purposes.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s hard to believe, though, given that the software was licensed to known bad actors in the Middle East, to the Mexican government (which has a long history of being adversarial to activists), and others. And regardless of NSO\u2019s intentions, the software has been used for evil.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to put a positive spin on this story. It seems that, once again, those in positions of power have crafted tools of abuse from the opportunities and resources that power presents. It\u2019s a solemn reminder that the ultimate goal of governments is to collect and maintain power at all costs and in all forms. And it\u2019s a reminder to citizens to stay vigilant, strong-willed, and sharp.<\/p> <p>Interested in more stories like the Pegasus Scandal?<\/p> <p>Subscribe to the AppleToolBox newsletter to keep up with the latest news, controversies, and all other things Apple.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3GL25Y684591VS0PAXZQS2J3XW9XM8"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":608,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["unknown","other"],"year":"2012","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mexico","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"politicians, journalists, govenment employee, military","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["unknown","other"],"year":"2012","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mexico","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"politicians, journalists, govenment employee, military","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":980977032,"Input.title":"Mauritius: ICT Act - How the government is taking another shot at censoring social media","Input.publish_date":"2021-04-21 09:28:13","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) has released a consultation document about the government's plans to give it more power to censor social media, naming Facebook specifically in the document. Here is why the plan is part of an older strategy to clamp down on the internet and why its claims that this is about cybercrime - rather than censorship - are not convincing.<\/p> <p>The strategy<\/p> <p>The document released by the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) seeks to set up a National Digital Ethics Committee (NDEC) with an enforcement unit empowered to take down and censor social media posts. To make its plan work, the document proposes allowing the government to set up a proxy \"to segregate from all incoming and outgoing internet traffic in Mauritius, social media traffic, which will then need to be decrypted, re-encrypted and archived for inspection purposes as and when required\".<\/p> <p>The plan, the document argues, will help fight cybercrime in social media by allowing the government to retain a record of social media posts and track down who posted them. Governments wanting a measure of control over new communication platforms is nothing new.<\/p> <p>Back in the early 1990s, the US government wanted telecom firms to allow them to eavesdrop on mobile phones by inserting chips in them accessible to law enforcement in the name of national security. By 1996, that plan was abandoned.<\/p> <p>Now its social media and governments across the globe have generally looked to three strategies of trying to control social media. The first is by simply blocking off social media sites (or the internet entirely).<\/p> <p>This has been done in states such as Uganda, Congo-Brazzaville and Chad (particularly during elections or times of unrest). But it's not just Africa that's guilty of that; according to the Internet Shutdown Tracker, India shut down the internet at various parts of the country no less than 106 times just in 2019, topping the global list in internet shutdowns.<\/p> <p>Pressure social media companies<\/p> <p>The second strategy is to pressure social media companies themselves to censor at the behest of governments. In 2018 Germany introduced a law mandating social media firms to take down illegal content within 24 hours, as did Australia in April 2019. The European Union is currently in the midst of harmonizing laws across its member-states to tackle copyright infringement on social media. In January this year, Russia passed a law forcing social media companies to censor content deemed illegal by the government.<\/p> <p>The third approach is to set up regulatory agencies to curb social media, this is the case in the UK, France and India, each of which is in the midst of setting up such bodies.<\/p> <p>What the ICTA is proposing falls within this latter category of strategies. But it goes further, the proposal allow ICTA itself to take down social media posts. \"In other states the debate on this is still raging and has been for years, so how can Mauritius just decide in 20 days, the middle of a pandemic, on how best to regulate social media?\" asks Rajen Narsinghen, senior legal lecturer at the University of Mauritius.<\/p> <p>Except of course, that the idea of giving the government the power to decide what does, or does not, appear on social media is not as new as all that.<\/p> <p>Old wine, new document<\/p> <p>The ICTA document is neither new nor shocking. But rather just the latest attempt in a long-term effort by the government to clamp down on social media. Starting in 2017, the government toyed with the idea of giving itself the power to ban websites and social media posts by amending current Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act (CMCA).<\/p> <p>The drafting instructions to the Attorney General's Office were even put up on the ICT Ministry's website. The rationale was to clamp down on fake news online. The problem was that the plan was derailed after the Law Reform Commission in September 2018 rejected the idea.<\/p> <p>While it called for tightening specific laws dealing with specific cybercrimes, regarding giving the power to the government to determine what and what was not fake news (and what could be published online) it had this to say; \"The main danger to enact such legislation is that it poses a threat to freedom of expression, as it can be used, among other things, to gag dissenting voices. Indeed, decreeing a legal duty of \"truth\" would create a dangerous instrument of control journalistic activities; allowing public officials to decide what amounts to truth is equivalent to accepting that the forces in power have a right to silence views they disagree with, or beliefs that they do not share.\"<\/p> <p>The LRC has reason to be wary. In June that same year, the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that, \"Encryption establishes, among other things, a measure of privacy that enables individuals to search the web, develop opinions and access information online. It may secure the traffic of emails, instant messages and other modes of digital communication so that individuals may express themselves freely\".<\/p> <p>Any interference in such communications, the UN added, should only be done on a case-by-case basis and only when ordered by a court. A far cry from the blanket powers the ICTA is looking to give itself now.<\/p> <p>In 2018, the government had to settle for watering down the provisions of the Information and Communication Technologies Act by amending it by widening what constituted a cybercrime ('causing distress') and reversing the burden of proof on those posting online to prove their innocence making prosecuting cybercrimes easier.<\/p> <p>This is to say that ICTA's latest proposals are just another episode in the ever-tightening grip of the government over social media.<\/p> <p>ICTA's credibility<\/p> <p>One of the biggest problems with the ICTA's proposals is that the regulator has precious little credibility when it comes to deciding what is, and is not, cybercrime and prosecuting it. In the Rachna Seenauth case in April last year, for example, the secretary of an ex-President was arrested for sharing a joke on social media poking fun at Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth.<\/p> <p>That was on a complaint by Kaushik Jadunundun, then a politically appointed board member of ICTA who boasted on Facebook that he did it \"for my boss and my country\". That was before Jadunundun himself was arrested and forced to leave the ICTA, board after he himself was accused of defamatory posts. Seenauth's affidavit notes that she received a message from Dick Ng Sui Wa, the Chairman of ICTA telling her that her post was \"not alright\".<\/p> <p>Also arrested last year for poking fun at the prime minister was ex-ambassador Ravin Lochun. There is an irony here, the government that now looks to squeeze out fake news, itself benefited from doctored videos in the last election campaign and a vast social media campaign against its opponents. \"There are double standards here,\" says Narsinghen.<\/p> <p>Is it about law and order?<\/p> <p>ICTA reassured everybody in a communique yesterday that its proposals would only affect public messaging platforms such as Facebook. In its consultation document it listed statistics about cybercrime: 2,051 incidents reported between January 2020 and January 2021.<\/p> <p>One reason these proposals are necessary, ICTA insisted was because, \"in Mauritius, when offensive and abusive online content is posted in the native Kreol language, in the majority of cases, complaints made by local authorities to the social media administrators remain unattended or are not addressed in a timely manner.\" In other words, social media companies are unwilling or unable to help stamp out cybercrime on social, forcing ICTA to give itself the power to do so.<\/p> <p>But how much of this is about cybercrime really? What kind of requests about cybercrime from the Mauritian government have these social media companies been ignoring? Luckily, they too publish figures.<\/p> <p>According to Google's Transparency Report, since 2016 it has received 13 requests from Mauritius, eight of which were from the government, to take down 29 web pages, out of which no less than 20 were for allegedly criticizing the government or for defaming government figures. Only one had anything to do with actual cybercrime, in this case, copyright infringement. Six of these were videos on social media.<\/p> <p>Posts criticizing the government<\/p> <p>Let's take Facebook. According to its own reports, between 2017 and 2019 the Mauritian government demanded information on seven user accounts. Once again, for posts criticizing the government or government figures. None of these requests were honored. At least according to Google and Facebook.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mauritius Media By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Or Wakashio, without social media nobody would have known what was going on and civil society would not have been mobilized\".<\/p> <p>For him the dangers are clear: \"For six years now the government has been making it harder to fight controversial building projects impacting the environment, leaving recourse only to the Supreme Court\". He adds that the decision to de-proclaim Pomponette beach has been going since 2016 at court and may only now start formal hearings. \"Social media is one of the key tools left for environmental rights, which have been shrinking in recent years, we need it to raise consciousness and to communicate with outside bodies and other environment NGOs. They are opening the door to something dangerous here\".<\/p> <p>This ICTA proposal is appearing after 2020 saw the government face a series of social media-fuelled protests over its mishandling of Covid-19, Wakashio and the Kistnen case. This is the key context here.<\/p> <p>The problem is that the government can easily transform ICTA's proposals into reality. The ICTA proposal says simply it can all be done by amending its enabling legislation. \"They can pass it as an ordinary bill, so they just need a simple majority in parliament, which they have\" argues Narsinghen,<\/p> <p>\"Of course given its implications it can be challenged in court for breaching constitutional protections to freedom or expression and the right to privacy\". In lieu of a lengthy court case and a lockdown, ironically, the only way to challenge ICTA's proposals is online. Precisely the type of activity the proposals from ICTA are putting in peril.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3IZVJEBJ6CZOBKFCOZGU0R2SFWT6Z5"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":756,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021","month":"April","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mauritius","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"private citizens, jounalists, internet users, social media, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ravin Lochu","victim_keywords":"ex-ambassador, joke, internet post","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kaushik Jadunundun","victim_keywords":"ICTA board member, Mauritius","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Rachna Seenauth","victim_keywords":"secretary of an ex-President, joke, social media, Pime Minister","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021","month":"April","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mauritius","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"private citizens, jounalists, internet users, social media, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ravin Lochu","victim_keywords":"ex-ambassador, joke, internet post","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kaushik Jadunundun","victim_keywords":"ICTA board member, Mauritius","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Rachna Seenauth","victim_keywords":"secretary of an ex-President, joke, social media, Pime Minister","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1017411631,"Input.title":"Survivors of mass incarceration speak truth to power at Spirit of Mandela Tribunal","Input.publish_date":"2021-12-03 16:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Jose Salda\u00f1a is the director of Release Aging People in Prison.

We\u2019re talking about Brown and Black kids coming in at that age. By the dozens, some dying, never returning back to their families. I saw this as new genocide because if it was happening to white kids at the level that it was happening to Black and Brown kids, there would be a public uproar. To me, this is neo-genocide.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s not as brutal as the genocide we\u2019re accustomed to seeing in history.

He was captured also but murdered in the street while he lay there in submission, trying to give up. They shot him in the back of the head. I consider myself a political prisoner. And based on how I was treated, the state considered me a political prisoner also.<\/p> <p>After my capture, I was beaten and tortured for the next six to seven hours. Usually in the U.S. when the police capture somebody or arrest someone, they don\u2019t torture them for no six or seven hours. They might smack them upside the head or beat them up for 10-15 minutes.<\/p> <p>Sekou Odinga is a member of the Black Liberation Army. He was beaten, tortured and unjustly incarcerated for 33 years.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s par for the course, you know. But for political prisoners, they usually save a particular brutal torture. My head was split open with a handheld walkie talkie that one of the cops, after he cuffed me with my hands behind my back, decided to hit me in the head and knocked me down, almost knocking me out.<\/p> <p>At the precinct, they kept me cuffed with my hands behind my back, stood two police on each side of me and started interrogating me. And every time I would answer a question that they didn\u2019t like, they would beat me or burn me with a cigar, or they would take my shoes off and grind my toe until the toenail came off.<\/p> <p>And this went on for about six to seven hours, all the time asking me questions about other comrades that they were looking for, Assata Shakur being one of them. Abdullah Majid being another one.<\/p> <p>Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera, member, Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation: Incarcerated for 36 years<\/p> <p>Solitary confinement is a very detrimental instrument, and it does create a lot of problems for those of us who are the victims of it. A penitentiary like ADX or Marion is very dehumanizing.<\/p> <p>What the United States government wanted most was to make us pay for a movement that was creating a lot of problems for them. We were condemned to as many years as they could sentence us to. But all of us made a commitment to the independence of Puerto Rico.<\/p> <p>We were willing to go to prison for Puerto Rico and for the decolonization of Puerto Rico. And for the decolonization of other places, because we never focused only on Puerto Rico.<\/p> <p>Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera is part of the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation. For his work fighting for Puerto Rican decolonization, he was caged for 36 years.<\/p> <p>For us, the injustices that the United States government was doing were painful. When the United States government thought that they really had us, we were strong and we were able to face the challenges that they imposed on us. Puerto Rico\u2019s independence is absolutely necessary.<\/p> <p>Colonialism is that tool the United States government has used effectively to take our most fundamental rights as human beings, and that\u2019s the right to self-determination. I am profoundly grateful for what Puerto Ricans did for us.<\/p> <p>After 36 years of imprisonment, I came home feeling stronger than the day that I entered the first penitentiary, and the time I spent in those penitentiaries was always awful. But little by little, I was able to transcend all the punishments that they threw at me.<\/p> <p>And I walked out of the United States and into Puerto Rico. And for the independence of Puerto Rico, I have not given up.<\/p> <p>Saleem Holbrook, executive director, Abolitionist Law Center<\/p> <p>It\u2019s clear cut when you have a system that was founded on exploitation, that was founded on genocide, and its legacy continues today, there\u2019s no alternative but abolition. We have tried for centuries to reform this system.<\/p> <p>In 2020, we all witnessed national uprisings against police violence, against police murder, against extrajudicial murder in this country. However, that uprising was nothing new. We saw it in the 1960s. We saw it in 1980 in Liberty City. We saw it in 1992 in Los Angeles. We could go back to the riots of 1919, and we could go back further. This is an epidemic in this country that we have been dealing with for generations.<\/p> <p>Saleem Holbrook is executive director of the Abolitionist Law Center, a law firm founded to abolish racist and classist mass incarceration in the US.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s unfortunate that I still had to experience this when political prisoners and movements 30, 40 and 50 years ago were fighting against this system and the abuses that it brings upon us.<\/p> <p>The common failure that I see is that when you look at all of the after-action reports, when you look at all the government reports, all of the city reports, all of them trot out the same tired reforms that were trotted out the last time there was an uprising, the last time there was a riot, the last time we felt the need to have to take to the streets and set something on fire.<\/p> <p>You have to come to the realization that this tactic has failed. And now we have to push further for abolition, because you can\u2019t reform it.<\/p> <p>Jalil Muntaqim, member, Black Liberation Army and Black Panther Party: Incarcerated for 49 years<\/p> <p>COINTELPRO was an operation by the federal government, by the FBI, to destroy any progressive, revolutionary or national militant organization during the \u201950s, \u201960s and the \u201970s. COINTELPRO operated to create dissension to infiltrate and to destroy a movement \u2013 to use every resource available to them to destroy the Black Panther Party. And by virtue of that, we fought back.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s very important to understand that our relationship to the state is political. Although they criminalize our politics, they convict us in the court of the criminal courts of law; and therefore, they try to deny the existence of political prisoners. I just want to make this point clear.<\/p> <p>Jalil Muntaqim, a Black Liberation Army and Black Panther Party member and recently released Political Prisoner, was wrongfully incarcerated for 49 years until 2021. In 1977, he started the first petition to the UN to acknowledge the existence of political prisoners. He conceived of the tribunal, just held in October, while still in prison in 2018.<\/p> <p>Back in 1977, I initiated the first petition to the United Nations to acknowledge the existence of political prisoners and, in the course of that, the conditions of prison itself. They denied the existence of political prisoners in the United States, the only industrial nation in the world that I\u2019m aware of who denies the existence of political prisoners.<\/p> <p>Because we are political, the state tries to suppress our capacity to teach. I was sent to solitary confinement for four months for my teaching classes. I was teaching the history of resistance.<\/p> <p>One of the things that they did not want us to do is teach prisoners, to raise their consciousness, to remove their relationship with a criminal mentality, to move them towards a revolutionary mentality.

There was a misunderstanding between Abubakar Shekau camp and that of the son of the late Muhammad Yusuf in March 2015 which gave birth to ISWAP, a Jihadist terrorist organization active in the Lake Chad Basin Areas.<\/p> <p>I came across the name in 2015 when a renowned terrorism reporter and a journalist Ahmed Salkida tweeted on his twitter handle that Boko Haram splinted into major groups. The group at that time seemed to be nonviolent; their modus operandi is like humanitarian workers helping the extreme or poor communities with water, shelter and other basic amenities. The group was doing so to create trust with the host communities and also create avenue of recruiting more young people into their group.<\/p> <p>The group is reported to have a strong allegiance with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The group appears to be working hard to gain more favour and support from ISIS, though they do provide training and technical assistance to them.<\/p> <p>Recently, the group executed four aid workers who were abducted on 18 July 2019 in Damasak in Borno State. They are in custody of the one woman among the aid workers and some other people including the lecturers from Adamawa. The group is kidnapping people and demanding for ransom which is one of its sources of finance.<\/p> <p>In November, Nigerian Air Force successfully targeted the senior members of the group and killed several of them in Jubilaram in the Lake Chad Basin. The operation, according to Air force spokesperson was part of the renewed offensive to end the protracted insurgency in the region.<\/p> <p>The renew attacks are very disturbing and came at a time the government is claiming that the group has been defeated technically. This month, the group has made several attacks at different locations in Borno and Yobe States. The group reported that they ambushed travellers along Maiduguri-Monguno road where six people were killed, an eye witness said four of them were humanitarian workers. Another one was in Damaturu where the Nigerian army successfully pushed them back and killed many of them. After they left Damaturu, they were also sighted along Miringa axis of Biu firing gun at communities. At last, to the credit of our gallant troops, they were pushed back.<\/p> <p>The major concern is that, ISWAP is growing in power and influence especially in its territorial base on the banks and Island of Lake Chad areas. The group has cultivated a level of support among local civilians. International Security Sector Advisory Team (ISSAT) reported that there is strong bond between ISWAP and these neglected communities and the terrorist group does provide economic support to them and treating them better than parent organization (Boko Haram) and by filling gaps in governance and service delivery. Filling this gap in governance and service delivery is very essential in winning this war and of course getting information from the communities that will help in tackling the conflict.<\/p> <p>ISWAP approach appears to have paid dividends in term of recruitment and support from the communities, displacing them will not be easy because they close to the population especially those communities of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The group reportedly extends micro-loans to local communities especially to women, youths and farmers. The government should not use force alone in fighting them; non-kinetic approach should also be considered to weaken their ties with those communities.<\/p> <p>For Nigeria to win this war, one step to start is to address the issue of human right abuses committed by security personnel and conduct themselves more professionally in discharging their duties in the affected communities.

Businesses irrespective of size are facing serious challenges such as the threat of significant declines in revenue, insolvencies and job losses in specific sectors. The sustainance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is also expected to be particularly difficult. Reports from the International Labour Organization predicts that the pandemic will have far-reaching impacts on labour market outcomes such as a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment.<\/p> <p>In Nigeria, the reality in its Labour Market is expected to be much worse, owing to the outdated and grossly insufficient provisions of the Nigerian Labour Act of 2004 which governs labour matters in Nigeria. This paper calls for fair regulations and\/or legislations in Nigeria whilst examining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on private labour relationships and exploring the various options available to employers and employees in mitigating the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a party\u2019s exposure to legal liability.<\/p> <p>INTRODUCTION<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>The Labour Act of 2004 offers merely basic and arguably primitive protection to employees in Nigeria such that its provisions are not in tandem with 21st century realities. The inadequacies of the Act have become manifest in light of the realities occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. While in more advanced climes, employees can expect some form of protection with respect to job securities and benefits, employees in Nigeria are more or less at the mercy of employers. Worse more is that the minimal provisions as encoded in the Labour Act in Nigeria fails to apply to the entirety of the Nigerian labour market.<\/p> <p>THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT VIS-\u00c0-VIS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC<\/p> <p>The relationship between the employer and the employee is largely a function of the employment contract. As held by the Supreme Court of Nigeria per Muhammad JSC in Iyere v. Bendel Feed and Flour Mill Ltd. the legal basis of employment between the employer and the employee is the contract of employment. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria such as the limitation imposed on movements, closure of non-essential businesses\/services and the lockdown pronounced in some states has necessitated an overhaul of the traditional performance of the obligations under the various employment contracts. For example, on the part of the employers, the reduction or outright loss of revenue due to little or no patronage from clients has directly impacted on their ability to sustain their obligations to pay wages to employees; while on the part of employees, the COVID-19 Regulations imposed by the President of Nigeria on March 30, 2020 has through the restrictions on movement, compromised an employee\u2019s ability to present his\/her self for work when required. Certainly, an employer may be desirous of relying on the employee\u2019s inability to show up for work as a reason to extinguish liability for not paying wages. However, technological advancements has provided adjustments which both parties can subscribe to, such as teleconferencing, email correspondence, and use of work-issued computers to enable an employee work from home.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Accordingly, where the adjustments as stated above can be reasonably applied, the issue of frustration of contract becomes mute. The Nigerian position on frustration of contract, as held by the Supreme Court per Adekeye JSC in Nwaolisah v. Nwabufoh is that a contract is frustrated when an unforeseen and unexpected event prevents its performance, with neither party being at fault for having caused the event that led to the frustration of the contract. The court set out examples of such events to include: subsequent legal changes or statutory impossibility and literal impossibility .<\/p> <p>The answer to the question of whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic will frustrate a contract of employment will definitely be case-specific and subject to an objective test such as the possibility of the business being carried on remotely or the practicability and implementation of the WHO Guidelines in the workplace , and whether or not the period of the restrictions caused by the pandemic had an ascertained duration . It is submitted that where the above issues are answered in the affirmative, the contract of employment may not be held to have been frustrated.<\/p> <p>Force Majeure clauses can also be invoked to extinguish the obligation on the part of an employer to perform his duties as specified in the contract of employment. However, force majeure clauses are contractual, that is, they must be incorporated into the contract of employment. Section 17(1) of the Labour Act which unfortunately is restricted in its application , gives an appearance of statutory flavor to force majeure events by requiring payment of only one-day\u2019s wage in the event of a temporary emergency or circumstances beyond the employer\u2019s control but subjects it to other limitations.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, there are a variety of options that can be considered by employers and employees to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. They are discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, LAY-OFFS, UNPAID LEAVE AND SHORT-TERM WORK<\/p> <p>By the provisions of the Section 11 of the Labour Act of 2004 and in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employer may terminate the contract of employment by notice or by payment of salary in lieu of notice. This can effectively be carried out anytime and without any explanation . The employer can also choose to lay off the employee to avoid or at least postpone redundancies<\/p> <p>Another alternative the employer can explore is Lay off. Laying-off indicates that the employer does not provide the employee with work, with the resultant effect that the employee also does not get paid. It is usually employed for business\/economic reasons . A lay-off can be permanent; where permanent, it may likely become subject to the same statutory provisions governing redundancy under the Labour Act or as governed under a contract of employment which may provide for compensation benefits. It can also be temporary, in which case, it is fully subject to the contract of employment entered into by the parties. It is instructive to note that a lay off when permanent is usually the effect of a redundancy exercise; however, redundancy under the Labour Act is defined as the \u201cinvoluntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of man power\u201d. As such, where a lay off occurs which is not the result of excess man power, the Labour Act will not give protection to such an employee as his\/her employment shall be governed strictly in line with the contract of employment as negotiated unilaterally by the employer. This leaves the employee at the mercy of the employer as is the case in any master-servant relationship .<\/p> <p>Where the lay-off is temporary, it is essentially an unpaid leave. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employers and employees may find the option of unpaid leave to be mutually beneficial. The employee is for all intents and purposes, relieved of his duty to work, and is also not entitled to payment for the period of the leave. This may be beneficial because it reduces cost on the part of an already economically-beleaguered employer and ensures job security for the employee. Sadly however, there is no express provision for unpaid leave in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Also, due to the fact that the Labour Act is silent on the issue of when an employee can take his\/her annual leave, employers may arbitrarily by agreement as a result of their enormous bargaining power, unfairly require qualified employees to utilise their annual leave during the period of the lockdown. It is however suggested that a fair renegotiated agreement be reached between the employer and the employee such as, reasonably reducing the number of leave days entitled to an employee in the given year of the lockdown. This may be desirable and fair given the circumstances as there is a need to strike a balance towards ensuring that the employee utilises his\/her leave when so desired and the employer makes the best of its resources by limiting the influx of employees utilising their annual leave all at the same time when the lock down is over.<\/p> <p>Short-term work denotes a diminution in work with a corresponding decrease in remuneration. This appears to be a much preferable approach, as both parties still perform their obligations, albeit, on a reduced scale. Lay-offs and short term work are not clearly contemplated by the provisions of the Labour Act and as such, employees are largely left subject to the terms of their respective contracts with the employers .<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>REDUNDANCY<\/p> <p>Section 20 of the Labour Act of 2004 defines redundancy as an involuntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of manpower. The section obligates an employer to, in the event of redundancy; inform the trade union or workers\u2019 representative concerned of the reason for and the extent of the anticipated redundancy . The principle \u201clast in, first out\u201d is also expected to be applied, subject to all factors of relative merit including skill, ability and reliability; and is also expected to, using his best endeavors, negotiate redundancy payments to any discharged workers who are not protected by any regulations made by the Minister of Employment, Labour and Productivity with respect to redundancy allowance. However, the position of the National Industrial Court as recently expressed in the case of Urinrin Digun-Aweto v. Ecobank Nigeria Limited is to the effect that for redundancy to be binding in a private contractual relationship, the redundancy policy must be provided for in the contract of employment.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>REDUCTION OF SALARY<\/p> <p>Due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, most employers have resorted to pay cuts or reduction of the employee\u2019s salary. Employers can adopt pay cuts in response to a corresponding decrease in the amount of work given to the employee or while maintaining the status quo on the amount of work done. These options, including the undesirable second option are available to the employer by reason of the insufficient provisions of the Labour Act. Section 7(1) of the Labour Act obligates an employer to within three months of the worker\u2019s period of employment; provide the worker with a written statement specifying the name of the employer or group of employers, nature of the employers business, period of notice to be given by party wishing to terminate the employment, rate of wages, manner and periodicity of payment of wages, hours of work, amongst others; and where there is to be a change in either of these, the employer shall within a month of the change, inform the worker of the nature of the change by a written statement. The employer does not however, have to comply with the above provision where there is a written contract of employment covering these matters. The reduction will largely be subject to the parties\u2019 freedom to contract which in most cases is dependent on the employer\u2019s terms.<\/p> <p>However, it is imperative to note that, an employer cannot unilaterally reduce an employee\u2019s salary. Salary reduction can only be done in compliance with the provisions of Section 7 or where such reduction is already envisaged in the contract of employment vide a hardship clause .<\/p> <p>Renegotiating the Contract of Employment Fairly: The basic requirement for the recognition of an employer-employee relationship is the existence of an enforceable contract of employment. To mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become necessary for the parties to an employment contract to renegotiate the contractual terms. The need for the employer to protect the continued existence of the business must be weighed alongside the employee\u2019s need for job security fairly. Where not already incorporated, the contract should be renegotiated to allow for salary reductions, redundancy packages, short-term work and unpaid leave. It is important to note that these renegotiated contracts are temporary in nature, spanning the duration of the pandemic. Failure to reach a consensus will most certainly lead to termination of employment and\/or litigation. This is another area in which the Labour Act of 2004 is grossly insufficient, as employees are subject more or less, to the whims and caprices of employers who have higher bargaining powers.<\/p> <p>In the United Kingdom, contracts of employment are governed by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 which prevents unreasonable attempts by employers to escape liability by rendering the offending clauses in contracts unenforceable. Therefore, any clause in an employment contract that prevents an employer from performing all or any of his obligations would be unenforceable, unless reasonable and fair. In addition, the employer is not allowed to render any contractual performance different in a substantial manner from that which was reasonably expected of the employee and the employer is also prevented from unreasonably excluding or restricting liability arising from its own breach of contract; and where possible negotiate fair compensation packages with the employee in the given event of a permanent lay off or termination of employment by way of redundancy.<\/p> <p>CONCLUSION<\/p> <p>There is an urgent need for a Labour Law that is up to date with 21st century realities that protects employees through wide all-encompassing clauses. This will prevent unreasonable reliance on concepts such as frustration of contracts to terminate contracts of employment unfairly.<\/p> <p>There is also a need for a statutory flavor in employment contracts to stipulate limitations for contract renegotiation in order to prevent the inclusion of unfair contractual terms and to ensure that employees are not taken advantage of. The Labour Act should also protect the employer\u2019s business where necessary, especially in circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore submitted that Nigeria should emulate the United Kingdom and put in place, relevant legislations that takes care of the issues as highlighted in this article.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3XEIP58NL226U5IJB3MWPAKP5RHZL5"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":505,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":956062342,"Input.title":"The Real Russia.

November 16, 2020. Sergey Gapon \/ AFP \/ Scanpix \/ LETA<\/p> <p>On Sunday, Moldova held a second round of voting in its 2020 presidential elections. Opposition candidate Maia Sandu won, becoming the first woman president in the country\u2019s history. Sandu defeated the incumbent head of state, Igor Dodon, who is often referred to as one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s main supporters in the former USSR. Sandu, on the other hand, is considered a pro-EU, anti-corruption candidate .<\/p> <p>A six-week war in Nagorno-Karabakh has ended disastrously for Armenia. Judging by the map, the situation on the ground will revert mostly to the conditions in place before Yerevan\u2019s 1991 war with Baku, leaving Azerbaijani artillery perched just outside the breakaway republic\u2019s capital city and the 50,000 souls who call it home. The big difference this time around is the presence of Russian peacekeepers \u2014 about 2,000 of them \u2014 who will be there to monitor a Kremlin-brokered truce. Not formally part of the trilateral settlement but still very much involved in the conflict is Turkey, which is expected to field its own monitors in Azerbaijan, albeit outside the Karabakh region.<\/p> <p>For a better understanding of the violence that took place in this area since late September, and to explore what it means to have won or lost in this war, \u201cThe Naked Pravda\u201d turned to three experts: Neil Hauer (a Canadian journalist based in the Caucasus who\u2019s reported extensively on conflicts in Georgia, Syria, and Nagorno-Karabakh), Richard Giragosian (the director of the Regional Studies Center, an independent think tank based in Armenia), and Rob Lee (a former Marine engineer officer and a current doctoral student at King\u2019s College London).<\/p> <p>Opinion and analysis<\/p> <p>In an op-ed for Republic, columnist and former diplomat Vladimir Frolov makes a spirited defense of Russia\u2019s actions in Nagorno-Karabakh, swatting away criticisms from Western analysts, Russia\u2019s opposition, and Kremlin loyalists who argue that Moscow emboldened its enemies and betrayed its \u201cChristian allies.\u201d Frolov describes the trilateral settlement announced on November 10 as compatible with Russia\u2019s new \u201cstrategic restraint\u201d (see Meduza\u2019s October 29, 2020, newsletter), explaining that the peacekeeping contingent deployed to Azerbaijan is a relatively small risk for big rewards (ending the bloodshed, blocking France and America without shutting them out of the peace process entirely, and bolstering Russian influence in the South Caucasus). Frolov also emphasizes that the Kremlin carefully avoided overcommitting in the region, aware that there\u2019s little public support for a major intervention.<\/p> <p>At the same time, Frolov acknowledges that Putin pledged and deployed troops to Karabakh on flimsy legal grounds, using the Federation Council\u2019s permission for Russian intervention in Syria as a free pass to send troops anywhere at any future time. The status of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region itself, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t been resolved, and Yerevan, Baku, and Moscow all apparently expect different things here, ranging from the fantasy of independence, the lands\u2019 total Azerbaijani subjugation, and a multiconfessional hodgepodge guarded indefinitely by Russian peacekeepers.<\/p> <p>For the foreseeable future, Armenian sovereignty has been reduced to something like Abkhazia\u2019s, says Frolov, who also argues that Moscow doesn\u2019t want to see Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan ousted in another coup and replaced with hardliners who would seek to undo \u201cPutin\u2019s Plan\u201d in Karabakh by restarting the war. Despite vitriol in the media about Pashinyan belonging to George Soros, he\u2019s now beholden to Vladimir Putin more than anyone, for his political future and perhaps his very life, Frolov says.<\/p> <p>In an op-ed for Novaya Gazeta, deputy chief editor Andrey Lipsky says there\u2019s a chance for improved U.S.-Russian relations with President Biden, though Moscow can expect the return of traditional Democratic (big \u201cD\u201d) rhetoric on human rights. Joe Biden is also more committed to Eastern Europe\u2019s struggles against Russian influence, which will restore some of America\u2019s interest in Ukraine and the Baltic states, for example.<\/p> <p>When it comes to sanctions, Washington may have exhausted all its options, short of a mutually painful escalation that might be justifiable only if Russia continues its bad behavior internationally.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, a breakthrough could be possible in arms control negotiations, which diplomats could perhaps build on to reach talks on cyber-defense. A cyber treaty could go a long way, argues Lipsky, to normalizing bilateral relations and boosting the role of experts in a field overcrowded by \u201cpropagandists and hawks.\u201d<\/p> <p>In an article for Mediazona, journalist Maxim Litavrin catalogs the largely undocumented spread of coronavirus through Russia\u2019s Federal Penitentiary Service , which has been extremely reluctant to release data to the public or confirm outside reports of infections. For this information, Litavrin relies on members of public monitoring commissions who visit prisons to speak to inmates and observe living conditions, as well as other human rights activists, journalists, and inmates\u2019 lawyers and relatives.<\/p> <p>In a pattern that repeats across the country, Russia\u2019s prison officials have apparently avoided diagnosing likely COVID-19 cases, left prisoners to handle the illness on their own, and refused to disclose test results. Since the start of the pandemic, Russia\u2019s Federal Penitentiary Service has acknowledged only about 1,600 coronavirus infections, including just a single, solitary death. (For comparison, at the time of this writing, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has recorded 3,336 COVID-19 cases and 140 deaths among inmates.)<\/p> <p>Historian Alexander Abalov and economist Vladimir Inozemtsev have a new book which they vow is built on \u201chistorical facts and the logic of state development,\u201d according to Republic. An excerpt published online makes it apparent that Abalov and Inozemtsev embrace a grand view of \u201cfacts and logic.\u201d In the text available at Republic, the two authors argue that Russian elites have \u201cMuscovized\u201d the country\u2019s post-Soviet development by trying to resurrect the most stagnating, repressive aspects of Russia\u2019s imperial past , which lack even the great ambitions of peak imperialism in the Tsarist and Soviet eras.<\/p> <p>Abalov and Inozemtsev say Russia\u2019s post-Soviet leaders have abandoned the USSR\u2019s late emphasis on human capital as the driver of economic progress and shifted their focus to sectors that could be consolidated in the state\u2019s hands and controlled with the minimal involvement of most society. All states extract and redistribute rents, Abalov and Inozemtsev admit, but these actions by Russia\u2019s modern-day petrostate are conducted chiefly to serve the elites\u2019 material interests rather than improve the public good. The justifications offered for this process, the authors claim, are \u201cirrational\u201d ideas about \u201cnational expediency.\u201d<\/p> <p>In their assessment of Russia\u2019s post-Soviet trajectory, Abalov and Inozemtsev settle on a version of path dependency, arguing that the elites\u2019 efforts to revive Muscovite and Russian imperial practices were both \u201cquite natural and apparently inevitable,\u201d as well as the result of a variety of factors, ranging from popular expectations, elites\u2019 commercial interests, and objective economic trends, which they say makes it wrong to attribute the imperialist revival to a few random personal factors. If this turn was predetermined, however, Russia\u2019s future is up for grabs, they say. Moscow lacks the strength economically and socially to serve as the post-imperial consolidation point it wants to be, meaning that Russia\u2019s current economic system isn\u2019t a post-Soviet endpoint. In other words, another major destabilization with unpredictable results lies ahead.<\/p> <p>Other news in brief<\/p> <p> Suing Putin\u2019s mouth.

It prevents individuals from applying for asylum in the United States if they could have pursued asylum in another country first.<\/p> <p>There are few exceptions: (1) if you lose your asylum claim in a third country, or (2) if you only passed through the few countries who are not parties to certain United Nations refugee conventions. None of these countries are located in Central America, through which the many refugees travel on their way to the U.S.<\/p> <p>As a scholar of immigration law, I can state with authority that \u2013 unlike other policies \u2013 this particular move will likely result in the death, kidnapping and torture of individuals seeking safety from persecution and torture in their home countries.<\/p> <p>Asylum-seekers\u2019 journeys<\/p> <p>Asylum-seekers at the southern border come from all over the world, not only Central America.<\/p> <p>Before I became a law professor, I worked as a staff attorney at Human Rights Initiative of North Texas, a legal services nonprofit in Dallas, Texas. There, I represented dozens of asylum-seekers in both affirmative and defensive asylum claims during the Bush and Obama administrations.<\/p> <p>The vast majority of our clients entered through the southern border. They were fleeing violence from every corner of the world: Eritrea, Egypt, Iran, Chad, Cuba, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Nepal \u2013 and yes, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, too.<\/p> <p>Last summer, I led an effort to provide legal information regarding credible fear interviews to over 300 asylum-seekers transferred straight from the southern border to a county jail in Albany, New York. They came from 39 different countries and spoke 19 different languages.<\/p> <p>To qualify for asylum in the United States, an individual must show that they have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution in the future on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.<\/p> <p>Courts have interpreted membership in a particular social group to include claims involving persecution due to gender, sexual orientation, family affiliation and other types of persecution that the government cannot or will not prevent.<\/p> <p>One of my former clients, a human rights worker from a country in Africa, narrowly escaped death after having been imprisoned and tortured by her own government. She swam across the Rio Grande to seek safety in the United States after catching a flight to Central America and making her perilous journey north. She was eight months pregnant. When she arrived in our office with her husband, also a refugee and also a client, she was days away from giving birth and in crippling distress.<\/p> <p>Months later, after giving birth, she and her husband, were granted asylum by an immigration judge. They might not be alive today had the U.S. government not protected them.<\/p> <p>New struggles under the ban<\/p> <p>Under the asylum ban, individuals like my client are less likely to survive.<\/p> <p>First, upon arriving at the border, asylees are subjected to another Trump-era policy implemented on January 25: the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, which requires them to wait in line in Mexico with thousands of other migrants until it is their turn to request asylum.<\/p> <p>If they avoid the rape, beatings, kidnappings and ransom that have plagued those waiting in Mexico, a new fate awaits them. They might make it to the front of the line, only to be turned away under the new policies. Immigration judges presiding remotely over closed hearings from the United States can decide that under the new policy, an individual is required to seek asylum in one of the countries they passed through before arriving in Mexico.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s say that country is Guatemala, one of the countries that asylees traveling by land from anywhere in Central or South America must pass through in order to reach Mexico. The U.S. State Department indicates that Guatemala \u201cremains among the most dangerous countries in the world,\u201d due to \u201cendemic poverty, an abundance of weapons, a legacy of societal violence, and the presence of organized criminal gangs.\u201d<\/p> <p>This small, troubled country now has a long line of asylum applications to process, which it is already ill-equipped to do. Guatemala\u2019s asylum system has been characterized by immigration experts as \u201cembryonic.\u201d As of Aug. 2, its four asylum officers had not resolved any of the 423 cases awaiting a decision.<\/p> <p>Many asylees will likely face difficulty traveling back to Guatemala, El Salvador or other common waypoints. Even if they did, they would find no protection there and little chance to survive in a country struggling to keep its own citizens safe.<\/p> <p>Legal challenges<\/p> <p>Many of the over 10,000 migrants waiting at the border \u2013 whose numbers are growing daily \u2013 face similar dangers.<\/p> <p>Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported on the kidnapping of a family of four awaiting their chance to seek asylum. That story cited a human rights report cataloging more than 110 cases of violent crimes against asylum-seekers waiting as a result of the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, during observations of hearings at the border in June and July.<\/p> <p>So far, lawsuits challenging this ban have failed. The most recent legal challenge, filed on Sept. 16, is on behalf of more than 100 migrant mothers and children directly impacted by the asylum ban.<\/p> <p>That lawsuit documents and challenges the inconsistent implementation of the policy. For example, the first step in articulating an asylum claim at the border is a process called a \u201ccredible fear interview.\u201d Under the asylum ban, individuals have not been provided legal orientation regarding the new processes for these interviews.

International investors imagined the dawning of a new era of predictable rules, cleaning up of pervasive corruption, and reigning in of rent-seeking officialdom.<\/p> <p>Mnangagwa himself played along, adopting the mantra, \u201cZimbabwe is (now) open for business\u201d, and, as he took to the perennial donning of a scarf in the national colors, serving as a moving billboard of the country\u2019s supposed new standing in the community of nations.<\/p> <p>Yet it has taken a mere two years for Mnangagwa\u2019s awkward pretense to collapse totally, and irretrievably. Matching Mugabe in cruelty and entitlement, but bereft of his erstwhile mentor\u2019s eloquence and intelligence, Mnangagwa has promptly cut himself out as a buffoon, pitiably clueless in statecraft, and possessing a cartoonish sense of his own invincibility.<\/p> <p>The world has now seen what discerning Zimbabweans always knew: that Mnangagwa was in fact Mugabe\u2019s water carrier and enforcer, and that November 2017 was neither state epiphany nor ruling party self-renewal, but simply the impatience of a son awaiting the inheritance of his own turn to maim, kill and steal.<\/p> <p>Because, what open-for-business rhetoric can remain standing after the vindictive arrest of Hopewell Chin\u2019ono, who has been leading expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9 of serious corruption in government, some of it implicating Mnangagwa or his family?<\/p> <p>What \u201csecond republic\u201d and \u201cnew dispensation\u201d bombast can sound meaningful after the recent abduction of, and shocking sexual violence against, three young female opposition party organizers \u2013 who included a member of the National Assembly \u2013 and the subsequent traumatization of the same women through their arrest for supposedly faking their own abduction?<\/p> <p>What claims about reforming politically and fighting corruption can be sustained after a two-year period in which peaceful demonstrators have been gunned down in cold blood, elections have been manipulated, big political fish remain untouched in spite of clear evidence that they are looting the public purse, and crimes under international law such as abductions and systematic torture continue precisely from where Mugabe left off?<\/p> <p>Now, the regime in Harare will say that Hopewell was not arrested for being a journalist. The actual allegations against him are \u201cincitement to participate in public violence\u201d, this for having tweeted to the effect that Zimbabweans must not tolerate corruption, and that they have constitutional rights of assembly and expression.<\/p> <p>The regime knows that the substantive allegations against him are legal hot air, and so clearly the idea is to effectively punish Hopewell through pretrial travesties. As senior Mnangagwa ally Patrick Chinamasa had previously expressed his discomfort that Hopewell\u2019s anti-corruption journalism was embarrassing Mnangagwa\u2019s family, the regime\u2019s animus against Hopewell is obvious.<\/p> <p>Still, to understand why the arrest and arraignment are absurd, how they amount to the use of police powers and prosecution process as persecution of (perceived) opponents, and, as Amnesty International Regional Director Deprose Muchena has observed, how they seek to inspire fear in critics, international observers need two contexts: context on the way Mnangagwa\u2019s regime operates; and context on the alleged crime itself.<\/p> <p>A few most recent examples illustrate the dynamics.<\/p> <p>Last month, Zimbabwe\u2019s Chief Justice issued directives to judges, requiring that, before they are issued, their judgments are to be \u201cseen and approved\u201d by their superiors \u2013 a patently unconstitutional instruction to judges that are supposed to be independent.<\/p> <p>Although the Chief Justice tried to walk back the order the following day by dropping the word \u201capproved\u201d to leave the requirement that the judgments be \u201cseen\u201d \u2013 whatever that means \u2013 and although it was further claimed that he had later withdrawn the entire directive, the whole purpose was and remains clear.<\/p> <p>In the same troubled month, lawyer and academic Alex Magaisa exposed the extensive looting by senior regime figures and their friends of an agricultural mechanization scheme under Mugabe, a heist that resulted in a massive public debt burden on the back of taxpayers.<\/p> <p>Against the backdrop of the recent investigative revelations by Hopewell, Mathuthu, and other journalists, of the Covid-19 supplies scandal; concerns by legislators such as Tendai Biti at the Public Accounts Committee about billions of dollars that have been diverted from another agricultural scheme, this time under Mnangagwa, styled \u201ccommand agriculture\u201d; strikes by nurses amidst a now totally collapsed healthcare system; and a festering of desperation in a hungry populace some of whom said they wanted to see mass demonstrations against the regime, throughout July Mnangagwa operated in panic mode.<\/p> <p>On 21 July, Mnangagwa announced enhanced Covid-19 lockdown measures for an indefinite period, making no reference to any calibration of levels of government measures as previously done. Under the new measures, in addition to everyone being under curfew from 6 pm to 6 am, during the day all \u201cnon-working\u201d Zimbabweans are required to stay home except when looking for essentials, a measure that is immensely complicated by the fact that formal unemployment in the country is at over 90 percent.<\/p> <p>Even against the background of a genuinely worsening Covid-19 situation, still the draconian nature of Mnangagwa\u2019s measures raised the eyebrows of the United Nations. And the insincerity of these measures became all too clear as one recalled how, since the onset of the pandemic, Mnangagwa himself had continued to convene several non-socially-distanced ruling party events, and, just prior to his 21 July announcement, it had not been unusual to see mask-less, sardine-packed police officers sitting in the beds of huge police trucks, patrolling for lockdown compliance.<\/p> <p>Lawyers have recently been arrested on charges that have stood clearly to the legal profession in the country and to international human rights organizations as the blatant persecution that they represent.<\/p> <p>And in the regime\u2019s discombobulated response to Magaisa\u2019s agricultural mechanization expos\u00e9, even Rhodesia was invoked as supposed good practice in its having passed onto black and white taxpayers the burden of odious debts generated from racist state spending on its minority white population.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that on Monday 20 July, about eight police officers broke a glass partition to force their way into Chin\u2019ono\u2019s home, seizing him without due process, and later turning him up at a Harare police station.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that on the following Tuesday, after Chin\u2019ono had spent a night in police cells, Magistrate Judith Taruvinga signed a vague and overbroad warrant for the police to search Chin\u2019ono\u2019s house for \u201cillegal documents and other articles kept at the house\u201d.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that about 30 armed riot police later that day raided Chin\u2019ono\u2019s home to seize his camera \u2013 as if a tweet would reside in a camera \u2013 and this after having acquired a second purported warrant that specified his \u201ccameras\u201d.<\/p> <p>It is also in this context that no such raids or searches were performed against Obadiah Moyo, the former government minister whose corruption Chin\u2019ono exposed so irrefutably that a protective, reluctant Mnangagwa had to fire him when the pressure became unbearable; an Obadiah Moyo who then appeared at court unhandcuffed, while Hopewell, the whistleblower against him, was handcuffed for his punitively drawn-out appearances at bail court.<\/p> <p>And no arrests have been effected against those implicated in the diversion of funds from so-called command agriculture.<\/p> <p>So, it is a context in which Mnangagwa\u2019s regime thrives on lies, on smoke and mirrors, using the law and institutions of justice not as the testaments they should be to any people\u2019s vision of belonging, fairness and dignity, but as knobkerries and carrots at the beck and call of a temperamental emperor.<\/p> <p>Such lies used to fool some, for some time. But they have now created an environment of lawlessness and injustice \u2013 an environment that, sadly, has made responsible investors think twice about bringing capital to Zimbabwe. When a regime shoots itself in the foot as Mnangagwa\u2019s is doing, the foreign investment that comes to its country is, typically, crudely extractive: blood contracts, in effect, cynically calculated to hollow out a nation\u2019s natural resources in exchange for supporting its rulers with military tanks, guns and ammunition, other apparatuses of political and social repression, and fat personal bank accounts.<\/p> <p>Tawanda Mutasah is an international lawyer and a recipient of the International Bar Association\u2019s International Rule of Law Award.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3VCK0Q0PO7TZGKFEJMPJW3LSSFYN03"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1629,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"07","date":"20.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Zimbabwe","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tsitsi Dangarembga","victim_keywords":"Author","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hopewell Chin\u2019ono","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mduduzi Mathuthu","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tawanda Muchehiwa","victim_keywords":"Tortured, nephew","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fadzayi Mahere","victim_keywords":"Lawyer","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"07","date":"20.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Zimbabwe","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tsitsi Dangarembga","victim_keywords":"Author","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hopewell Chin\u2019ono","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mduduzi Mathuthu","victim_keywords":"Journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tawanda Muchehiwa","victim_keywords":"Tortured, nephew","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fadzayi Mahere","victim_keywords":"Lawyer","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1001797753,"Input.title":"Inside Myanmar\u2019s Daily Junta Reality","Input.publish_date":"2021-08-31 05:17:47","Input.article_interface":"<p>Myanmar\u2019s military leaders used its armed forces to launch its coup and take control of the country from its elected government on February 1, 2021.

When we had to run and go into hiding, we lost our home and our possessions. You lose your income. Your equipment. You never feel safe when hiding. Living like this affects all of us. If the military does not find me, they will pressure and threaten my family with arrest.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet said he is still working despite the risk of arrest.\u201cLosing a journalist is a big loss for our struggle for democracy. We\u2019re only doing our job as reporters, but our news coverage exposes the military and its abuses \u2013 this is why we\u2019re the enemy.\u201d<\/p> <p>Despite the danger to him and his family, Nyan Linn Htet worries about the safety of those who helped him avoid arrest. \u201cIf I\u2019m caught in hiding, the SAC (military-appointed State Administration Council) will persecute the people who gave me a place to live. I\u2019m afraid they [the military] will arrest those who helped me.\u201d<\/p> <p>His fears are well founded.<\/p> <p>Journalist and political analyst Sithu Aung Myint was high on the military\u2019s wanted list for his political commentary and published opposition to the coup. On Sunday August 15, the military raided the home of his colleague, BBC freelance producer, Htet Htet Khine, and arrested both of them. A week later, in its Sunday August 21 edition, the military-run newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said Sithu Aung Myint had been charged with sedition, spreading \u2018fake news\u2019 and being critical of the military coup leaders and its State Administration Council under Sections 505 (a) and 124 (a) of the Penal Code. He could be sentenced to life in jail under Section 124 (a) of the penal code. Htet Htet Khine was arrested for giving shelter to Sithu Aung Myint, and charged under section 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act for working with the recently formed National Union Government\u2019s radio station, Federal FM.<\/p> <p>Friends and colleagues of Sithu Aung Myint and Htet Htet Khine told IFJ they are concerned both journalists were held at an interrogation centre for over a week before having access to either legal help or contact with colleagues or family.<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet told IFJ he is aware his legal and human rights will not be respected if he is arrested. \u201cThey will not let us get legal help until they\u2019ve got what they want from us. The military amended 505 (a) of the Penal Code to prevent giving us bail. We know they will jail us even if we have legal representation. We know SAC is torturing journalists because of the work we do.\u201d<\/p> <p>Reports by local and international humanitarian groups have detailed the severe beatings \u2013 hours of maintaining stressed positions, use of sexual violence \u2013 and killing of people while held in detention.<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet said if arrested, he knows it will come with beatings. He admits that the thought of being tortured keeps him awake at night. \u201cThey will jail me, but only after they torture me. I will not be released until I sign a statement that I will never criticize them. I\u2019m not afraid of being arrested, but torture scares me. There are nights when I\u2019m too afraid to sleep.\u201d<\/p> <p>He and other local journalists told the IFJ it was disappointing that international media has dropped Myanmar from its news agenda and moved on to cover other stories.<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htets said despite access difficulties, the international media can use local reporters who are willing to help. \u201cWe know the difficulties media has getting ground access to Myanmar. Covid-19 restrictions also make it impossible to legally cross borders from neighboring countries, but we are already here in the country and are capable of doing the job.\u201d<\/p> <p>Despite the fear of arrest and torture, he is still reporting and urged local journalists to keep doing the same. \u201cIt\u2019s important we use what we can to still work and report news events of interest to people. People are accessing news and information in many different ways now.\u201d<\/p> <p>The military, while thrashing local and international laws and ignoring its constitution, is quick to use and amend laws to jail its opponents for being critical of the coup and for reporting military violence, abuse and corruption.<\/p> <p>We have no rights<\/p> <p>Nan Paw Gay, editor-in-chief at Karen Information Center, said the military council has no respect for journalists or their right to publish information in the public interest.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is no freedom of the press. If journalist\u2019s try to report news or seek information from the military\u2019s opponents \u2013 CRPH, NUG, CDM, G-Z and PDF \u2013 the State Administration Council prosecutes them under Section 17\/1 of the Illegal Association Act. Since the military launched its coup, sources we use have had their freedom of speech and expression made illegal and they now risk arrest for talking to us and\u2026 we can be arrested for speaking with them. Independent media groups have been outlawed and totally lost their right to speak freely or write about news events.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nan Paw Gay points out if journalists are \u201ccritical of the military, its appointed State Administration Council or its lack of a public health plan to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic now ravaging the country, section 505 (a) is used to arrest journalists for spreading false news.\u201d Essentially torture is used to terrorise journalists, she said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen the military council arrests and detains journalists, the torture is both physical and psychological. Even before being detained threats are issued and then during the arrest the violence becomes real \u2013 shootings, people being kicked and dragged from homes by their hair and beaten.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nan Paw Gay says women journalists are more likely to be \u201ctortured using psychological abuse \u2013 kept in a dark room and constantly told that they will be killed tomorrow \u2013 to mess and generate fear with their thoughts. You can see the effects of the tortured on some journalists when they appear in court \u2013 shaking hands and body spasms.\u201d<\/p> <p>Military brutality is a daily reality for Myanmar\u2019s people. At the time of writing, the army is preparing to deploy and reinforce its bases with hundreds of extra troops into areas of the Karen National Union-controlled territory and where anti-coup protestors, striking doctors and politicians have been offered refuge and safety. A senior ethnic Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) soldier told the IFJ that army drones and helicopters have been surveying the area in recent months.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe know they\u2019ve sent munitions and large troop numbers to our area\u2026 last time we had drones flying over our area, they later attacked villages and our positions with airstrikes. They\u2019re already fighting in our Brigade 5 and 1 and have started in 6 and 2.\u201d<\/p> <p>Since the military launched its coup on February 1, there has been at least 500 armed battles between the KNU and the military regime and 70,000 Karen civilians have been displaced and are hiding in makeshift camps as a direct result of these attacks. Fighter jets have flown into Karen National Union-controlled areas 27 times and dropped at least 47 bombs, killing 14 civilians and wounding 28.<\/p> <p>Naw K\u2019nyaw Paw, general secretary of the Karen Women Organization, in an interview with Karen News, said villagers displaced by the Myanmar Army attacks are now in desperate need of humanitarian aid.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey shoot at villagers if they see them on their farms, burning down their rice barns and killing the livestock left behind.

And yet, despite that vast wealth, there is still a massive tech talent gap. And now there\u2019s a growing trend of tech workers coming together to call for greater unionization in this sector. This is moving beyond petitions and signed letters from staff, to increased walkouts, employee resource groups, and even formal trade unions.<\/p> <p>On January 4, the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) launched with 230 members, instantly making it the biggest tech union. A few weeks later, the membership of this American and Canadian union, which includes permanent, contracted and vendor company employees of Google, its subsidiaries, and other Alphabet Inc. brands, has quadrupled. Earlier this week, international Googlers across 13 countries formed a coalition of unions called Alpha Global.<\/p> <p>\u201cTogether, we will change Alphabet,\u201d the global alliance commits.<\/p> <p>But Google employees aren\u2019t the first to want to change their tech companies and we are pretty sure they won\u2019t be the last. So today we reflect on the growing mobilization of people in tech, and try to predict where it\u2019s headed.<\/p> <p>OK, Google, How\u2019d You Get Here?<\/p> <p>We write it a lot \u2014 if the tech industry is building the future, then we have to be sure what kind of future we\u2019re building. But before it goes cross-industry, any push for change often starts within a company. In tech\u2019s case, it started with Google.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt Google, we have a really long history of employee activism. A decade or more of working together to steer the company in an ethical direction,\u201d Andrew Gainer-Dewar, Google software engineer and spokesperson for AWU, recently told The New Stack.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t do evil. Do the right thing. These used to be the mottos for Google. But, in April 2018, when the world learned of the now-infamous Project Maven contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for AI-backed drone feeds, about four percent of the Google staff wrote an open letter to the Alphabet CEO, demanding not only that Google pull out of the contract, but that \u201cGoogle draft, publicize and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.\u201d In the minds of these Google employees, adding muscle to a war machine could be viewed as doing evil, and they were complicit in this direction (Google declined to interviewed for this story, though provided written commentary and associated resources).<\/p> <p>\u201cThe company is an architect of the new world of work. It is a major incubator of innovations, and as a technology leader, it is a laboratory for new methods of communications and working. Unfortunately, Alphabet is also a creator of inequalities, implicated in sexual harassment and oppression of sexual minorities and people of colour. It is a place where many workers came to change the world \u2014 to make it more democratic \u2014 only to find Alphabet suppressing speech and cracking down on worker organizing while consolidating monopolistic power.\u201d \u2014 Alpha Global<\/p> <p>Among other things, this letter notably stated \u2014 in bold \u2014 that the Project Maven affiliation \u201cwill irreparably damage Google\u2019s brand and its ability to compete for talent.\u201d This feels pointed, like it was reminding their boss how hard tech talent is to come by. Google decided not to renew its Project Maven contract and even created a new set of AI principles, which specifies that its AI research should not be used for weapons.<\/p> <p>Now, while Google got rid of the simple statement, \u201cDon\u2019t do evil,\u201d that wittily ended their much more extensive Code of Conduct with: \u201cAnd remember\u2026 don\u2019t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn\u2019t right \u2014 speak up!\u201d<\/p> <p>However, Google\u2019s response to people speaking up has been less than welcoming.<\/p> <p>In November 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees staged a global walkout to protest the way the company handled sexual harassment and pay inequality, and to end forced arbitration where all lawsuits had to be settled out of court.<\/p> <p>In September 2019, a group of about 80 Google contract workers who worked on-site in Pittsburgh, in an effort to bargain over wages and working conditions, voted to unionize and join United Steelworkers. The outsourcing company working for Google, in response, started a trend of offshoring that work to Poland, the protesters alleged. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which handles U.S. labor law, has scheduled a hearing.<\/p> <p>In November 2019, a few more employees were fired for organizing a protest against the company\u2019s work with the U.S. Border Patrol.<\/p> <p>Then a few weeks later, four employees \u2014 hence known as the Thanksgiving Four \u2014 were fired, allegedly accused of \u201cbreaking security policies\u201d in their efforts to expose Google\u2019s work with notorious union-busting firm IRI Consultants. Of course, this only served to make public Google\u2019s affiliation with IRI public knowledge.<\/p> <p>The ex-Googlers partnered with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and, in part, successfully petitioned the NRLB to challenge Google. This last December, the NRLB issued a complaint against Google for unlawfully monitoring and questioning several workers who were then fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union.<\/p> <p>This complaint charged that Google repeatedly violated U.S. labor law by using \u201cterminations and intimidation in order to quell workplace activism.\u201d It also charged that Google\u2019s checking of employee calendars \u2014 installing a tool on employees\u2019 web browsers that flagged internal calendar events requiring more than ten meeting rooms or 100 participants \u2014 to be \u201cunlawful surveillance.\u201d<\/p> <p>Google\u2019s official response to this step by the NRLB:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe strongly support the rights our employees have in the workplace, and open discussion and respectful debate have always been part of Google\u2019s culture. We\u2019re proud of that culture and are committed to defending it against attempts by individuals to deliberately undermine it \u2014 including by violating security policies and internal systems. The NLRB determined today that Google was justified in terminating three employees who violated our data security policies.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to provide information to the NLRB and the administrative judge about our decision to terminate or discipline employees who abused their privileged access to internal systems, such as our security tools or colleagues\u2019 calendars. Such actions are a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility, and we will be defending our position.\u201d<\/p> <p>This case will be brought in front of an administrative law judge on April 12.<\/p> <p>Also last December, Google made headlines and inspired outrage again when it fired then Co-Lead of Google\u2019s Ethical AI team Dr. Timnit Gebru, which Gebru charged was an effort to suppress her research and her internal criticism of Google\u2019s lack of genuine diversity efforts and lack of transparency surrounding both employee and research feedback.<\/p> <p>On Dec. 4, Jeff Dean, senior fellow and head of Google\u2019s research organization, publicly shared an internal email sent the day before that outlined the chain of events leading up to \u201cher decision to resign from Google.\u201d<\/p> <p>About 2,700 Googlers have signed a letter standing with Gebru, stating that Gebru\u2019s exit was a termination not a resignation and dubbing Google\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented research censorship\u201d and the letter includes the following:<\/p> <p>\u201cInstead of being embraced by Google as an exceptionally talented and prolific contributor, Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing\u2026 The termination is an act of retaliation against Dr. Gebru, and it heralds danger for people working for ethical and just AI \u2014 especially Black people and People of Color \u2014 across Google.\u201d<\/p> <p>Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also wrote a letter on Dec. 9 saying that the company was opening a review to \u201cassess the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru\u2019s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process.\u201d There hasn\u2019t been an official response from Alphabet since.<\/p> <p>Just this week AWU filed an unfair labor practice charge against Modis Engineering, a subcontractor that provides data center services for Google, on behalf of contractor and AWU member Shannon Wait. Wait was suspended last week after she complained on behalf of herself and other workers about conditions at the center, which includes a prohibition of talk about salaries. According to Wait, workers at the South Carolina Google data center, who often perform heavy manual labor, have seen their daily repairs doubled during the pandemic, increasing safety concerns.<\/p> <p>And not to just focus on the organizing work of the technical, so-called white-collar staff of Google, up until this month the most significant unionizing effort was back in December 2019 by about 2,300 Google Silicon Valley cafeteria workers. These workers are among Google\u2019s majority shadow workforce, which generally shares in worse, stagnant wages and benefits, while these particular workers live in the wildly expensive Silicon Valley. These service workers were following suit of 500 Facebook cafeteria workers who unionized back in 2017.<\/p> <p>Still, these cafeteria workers aren\u2019t the majority of Googlers and working for the world\u2019s fifth-richest company is still what many people in tech dream of. So what\u2019s the point of starting a union?<\/p> <p>Unionization efforts are also taking place within other IT companies.<\/p> <p>About a year ago, Kickstarter United OPEIU Local 153 was formed. Kickstarter was the first major tech company to unionize, under the chartered goals of \u201ctransparency, inclusion, solidarity, accountability, and joy\u201d and of supporting \u201corganizing efforts across the tech industry.\u201d<\/p> <p>In an industry defined by scrambling for venture capitalist investment, Kickstarter\u2019s employees stood out as reflective of a turning point for tech employee activism \u2014 not the impetus, but the first to reveal their plans.<\/p> <p>OPEIU is taking seriously the commitment we unanimously made at our 2019 convention to organize in the tech sector. Today, we\u2019re officially launching @techunion1010 \u2014 a union by & for tech workers. Read our statement on this historic day https:\/\/t.co\/8tj9fXlB6n #TechWorkers pic.twitter.com\/2cOp9LcPbb \u2014 OPEIU #PassThePROAct  (@OPEIU) January 25, 2021<\/p> <p>What\u2019s a White-Collar, Non-Binding Union to Do?<\/p> <p>The difference is that, while anomalistic for the tech industry, Kickstarter United is a traditional union with collective bargaining power. And the crowdfunding platform has less than 250 employees.<\/p> <p>There are 250,000 Alphabet employees and contracted workers worldwide. AWU includes everyone from the permanent employees to that shadow workforce, from cloud architects to massage therapists, including staff who could already be in other traditional sector unions.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are the first wall-to-wall whole company union,\u201d Gainer-Dewer said, which, at the time of the interview, just covered the U.S. and Canada officially through a CWA partnership.<\/p> <p>Joining AWU is completely voluntary. An Alphabet worker just has to fill out a form and sign a card, and then the union performs an employment check. Dues are one percent of total compensation, which Gainer-Dewer says seems on the low side for affiliated industries.<\/p> <p>The Alphabet Workers Union is filed as a so-called minority union, which means it can\u2019t leverage collective bargaining. Under U.S. labor law, Alphabet Inc. can ignore the union\u2019s demands until a majority of employees support it. However, there is something to be said about the power in numbers, particularly when tech retention is so directly tied to profits.<\/p> <p>Google responded to the announcement of AWU in early January, by way of director of people operations Kara Silverstein, with: \u201cWe\u2019ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce. Of course, our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we\u2019ve always done, we\u2019ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.\u201d<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer dubbed this \u201ccorporate doublespeak\u201d that Google says they \u201cwill continue to engage directly to all employees which they haven\u2019t done in years and will continue not to do.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said that Alphabet Inc\u2019s \u201cexecutive strategy has been to pretend we are irrelevant, and aggressive retaliation will be a part of that.\u201d<\/p> <p>So, without collective bargaining and other big union wins, and when Google has unofficially acted increasingly anti-union and even overtly retaliated against people for organizing, why pay to join AWU?<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer was compelled to get involved in organizing after the Thanksgiving Four fires because, in his words, he witnessed \u201cthis escalation from engaging with employees to ignoring employees to really aggressively retaliating. Made me worry the next time no one would or could speak up.\u201d<\/p> <p>As our short history lesson proves, Alphabet employees have a formed a habit of inner-company activism, but now it\u2019s about making it sustainable.<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer said that while \u201cPeople have been organizing to stand up to leadership for a very long time, building this kind of sustainable long-term structure to build our organizing capacity is new,\u201d maybe 18 months in the works.<\/p> <p>He continued, \u201cWe are building a structure that can support continued growth and building resilience over time.\u201d<\/p> <p>Resilience isn\u2019t just referring to momentum, but also, in the past, those who have tried to stand up, without this support infrastructure in place, experienced a lot of burnout.<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer said AWU members are also looking to foster a \u201cresilient capacity to speak with a collective voice, to have all of our members democratically reach consensus on what\u2019s important to us, and to speak up to executives.\u201d<\/p> <p>While the most significant milestone is AWU growing past 800 members in its first three weeks, it has already seemed to have influenced some of Alphabet Inc\u2019s decision making.<\/p> <p>After the Jan. 6 insurgence on the U.S. Capitol, AWU criticized Alphabet subsidiary YouTube\u2019s response of just taking down President Donald Trump\u2019s video that seems to have incited the domestic terrorist attack.<\/p> <p>AWU\u2019s official response called this \u201clackluster, demonstrating a continued policy of selective and insufficient enforcement of its guidelines against the use of the platform to spread hatred and extremism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Soon after the union\u2019s statement, YouTube revised its response to offer the Trump account an equivalent of a second strike, which means the account is frozen for at least two weeks.<\/p> <p>Last week, AWU also responded to the suspension of the corporate access of Margaret Mitchell, AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team, which notably lost Gebru a month earlier.<\/p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt if nothing else, the formation of this union has the media\u2019s ears open to the concerns of this sub-section of Alphabet employees.<\/p> <p>Is the Tech Industry on the Cusp of Change?<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer says it feels like a historic moment for tech giants to form unions.<\/p> <p>He said, \u201cI suspect there are groups of other people at other big tech companies, writing the open letters and doing the petitions.\u201d<\/p> <p>Just this last week, the union Kickstarter United is affiliate with \u2014 the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), AFL-CIO \u2014 has announced \u201cthe formation of its Tech Workers Union Local 1010, an arm of the union with a mission to raise industry standards and provide all tech workers a better future in their workplaces through collective bargaining.\u201d<\/p> <p>There are already chapters of the Tech Workers Union in tech hotspots Austin, Boston, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, as well as in Brazil, Italy, the Netherlands, Berlin, London and Bangalore, India. TWU\u2019s definition of a \u201ctech worker\u201d is anyone involved in the tech industry in any capacity, ranging from programmers and designers to product managers to gig workers like Uber drivers and even to students. Google, Microsoft, ASOS, Monzo and Deliveroo are said to be planning to join the London chapter.<\/p> <p>There is also a movement to unionize tech workers in the Global South.<\/p> <p>The New Stack looks forward to watching this space to see what comes next when tech turns activist.<\/p> <p>Feature image by Cytonn Photography on Unsplash.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"34XASH8KLS1WMJYYO6P9YPX0VX0PMC"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ea7ca118-9f34-4464-9425-0be339155b76","work_time_in_seconds":1997,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2018","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Alphabet Workers","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Margaret Mitchell","victim_keywords":"AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Donald Trump","victim_keywords":"President","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2018","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Alphabet Workers","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Margaret Mitchell","victim_keywords":"AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Donald Trump","victim_keywords":"President","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1025789101,"Input.title":"LankaWeb \u2013 The Heir of Yahapalana Govt\u2019s Failed Agenda","Input.publish_date":"2022-01-30 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Heir of Yahapalana Govt\u2019s Failed Agenda<\/p> <p>By Shivanthi Ranasinghe Courtesy Ceylon Today<\/p> <p>By Shivanthi Ranasinghe<\/p> <p>Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s response to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s opening statement of the second session of the ninth Parliament was thought provoking. Leaving aside his need to portray the Government as a failure, one must pay attention to the remarks he made vis-a-vis the military. That he makes his references to the military in his opening remarks itself makes this exercise important.<\/p> <p>The Opposition Leader notes that national security in its broad sense includes many aspects. The first element he declares is military security. Taking the recent incident involving the discovery of a hand grenade at All Saints Church in Borella, he builds his case that the military security under this Government has failed.<\/p> <p>Cardinal\u2019s Misgivings<\/p> <p>Soon after the bomb was discovered, Cardinal Ranjith called a press conference to air his misgivings with the ongoing investigation. His contention was the Police did not seem to take into account a person who was in church that morning.<\/p> <p>Unwittingly, the Cardinal revealed certain facts the investigators were unwilling to make public at the time. Nevertheless, the Police were able to track the perpetrator \u2014 a septuagenarian, obviously disturbed by bitter memories. The Cardinal, perhaps embarrassed, has not retracted his accusations \u2013 especially as the perpetrator claims to have had suffered discrimination at the hands of the church.<\/p> <p>The Cardinal\u2019s comments irked Defence Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne. However, the need is for both the Cardinal and the Government to work on their deteriorating trust issues. Both need to understand that our country is not at a juncture where we can afford to let our ego get in the way.<\/p> <p>Capitalising on the Cardinal\u2019s apprehensions, the Opposition Leader claims that military security has failed. The military, however, does not play a role in this bomb incident. This is a matter entirely for the Police.<\/p> <p>Even the dastardly Easter Attacks came under the purview of the TID, SIS and CID. The role the MI played was minimal. Even the underworld uses bombs and worse. Still, it is the Police that must deal with it and not the military. Therefore, the reason for a learned man who takes mighty pride in his knowledge to state the military had failed on a matter that concerns the Police is curious.<\/p> <p>This accusation itself is absurd. During the past two years, the entire world was crippled by the pandemic. Sri Lanka, however, managed better than most countries and that was because of the enormous service rendered by the military right from the onset.<\/p> <p>For instance, Sri Lanka\u2019s vaccination programme has been tremendously successful. For a short while, it was in danger of being foiled because of trade union actions. However, the military took over the vaccination programme and did a far more efficient job. Today, not even vaccine producing countries like the US or India has the kind of record Sri Lanka has achieved. This was only possible because of the military. Yet, not once during his long speech did the Opposition Leader acknowledge the strength of the military and the services rendered by them to our country.<\/p> <p>Therefore, we must understand the reason for Sajith Premadasa to attack on the military in the opening remarks itself. He may have broken away from the UNP and distanced himself from Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, it is clear that he has not distanced himself from the agenda the UNP undertook when forming the Yahapalana Government.<\/p> <p>The Yahapalana Grudge<\/p> <p>A defining feature of the Yahapalana Government was its relentless persecution of the military, mostly the Military Intelligence (MI). Entire MI teams were detained by the CID, which was then headed by the politically corrupt SSP Shani Abeysekera. In addition, the then Yahapalana Government tried its level best to throw behind bars the top military brass that gave leadership to end terrorism in the Island.<\/p> <p>Among this target list were incumbent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who functioned as the Defence Secretary, highly-decorated Major General K.A.D. Amal Karunasekara who functioned as the Director Military Intelligence, Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda who was the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy and Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne. Both Major General Karunasekara and Admiral Wijegunaratne were ignominiously detained by the CID over charges built on flimsy evidence.<\/p> <p>For instance, Major General Karunasekara was arrested by the CID in April 2018 over the abduction and assault of a national newspaper\u2019s Associate Editor in May 2008. Much publicity was given to the investigation team that flew to Australia, where he now domiciled, to get his statement. However, very little Media coverage was given to his statement itself, which stated the investigators were after the wrong men. Yet, it took months more before the CID reluctantly released eight serving and former officers of the Directorate of Military Intelligence. The case, after dancing in the Media for 18 months quietly slithered away.<\/p> <p>Ramanayake\u2019s Treacherous Task<\/p> <p>Likewise, all these cases that targeted the MI were projected as high profile despite the paucity of evidence. The investigators could not furnish enough evidence to even file a b-report. Yet, they were exposed to the full glare of the Media. They were thus humiliated disregarding the enormous service rendered by these individuals during and after the war to usher and ensure peace in the country.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, every single officer and man that was thus arrested had played a pivotal role in defeating the LTTE. Furthermore, some were still engaged in defending the country from attempts to revive the terrorist group.<\/p> <p>The LTTE\u2019s international network is still very active across the world. This entity that propagated the LTTE ideology bought sympathy for its macabre cause by getting politicians and journalists to delve deep in to their pockets. They funded terrorist activities in Sri Lanka and India which still continue to haunt us.<\/p> <p>The MI unit that shadowed these activities was arrested in 2015 over the disappearance of a supposedly tabloid journalist Prageeth Eknalogoda, who was unknown until his disappearance. To date, investigators do not know if his disappearance was voluntary or not. Apart from his estranged wife, who gained publicity and perhaps monetary assistance, no one else benefited from his disappearance. In fact, he only became famous because his disappearance is something of a mystery. Therefore, his importance to the MI or their need for him to disappear has not yet been established.<\/p> <p>Subsequently, recorded telephone conversations between former MP Ranjan Ramanayake and SSP Abeysekera revealed the political motivation behind these arrests. Ramanayaka, who is currently serving a four-year prison sentence for contempt of court, claims that he had never stolen from the public.<\/p> <p>Be that as it may, the role he played was far worse in persecuting opponents of the Yahapalana Government. From his own recordings, he exposed the political favours he promised judges and his manipulation of the CID\u2019s functions and investigations through the Director of the CID himself.<\/p> <p>Thus, it is extremely distasteful when SLPP MPs as Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgama and Geetha Kumarasinghe support the SJB\u2019s call for a presidential pardon for Ramanayake. Perhaps MP Kumarasinghe\u2019s sympathy stems from the fact that they are both from the same profession. Minister Aluthgamage is keen to prove that his battles with Ramanayaka are over. This level of immature reasoning distracts the actual damage caused by Ramanayaka.<\/p> <p>Premadasa, too, speaks of Ramanayake as a comrade. He is yet to condemn Ramanayake\u2019s attempts to corrupt our law enforcement officers for political gain. Premadasa never visited any of the officers or men or their families during their incarceration visited Ramanayake in prison.<\/p> <p>Ramanayake\u2019s efforts to persecute the MI must be analysed. The investigators did not have sufficient evidence to pursue the case. As in the case of Eknaligoda, it\u2019s not clear if a crime took place. Yet, Ramanayake\u2019s dedicated task was to ensure that investigators and judges breathed life into the persecution.<\/p> <p>Killing the MI<\/p> <p>The Yahapalana Government came to power on the promise to prosecute the corrupt. The failure to do so severely discredited that Government. However, persecuting the military was not part of that promise. In fact, then President Maithripala Sirisena even claimed his Government saved the military from possible prosecution from international courts.<\/p> <p>Yet, the persecution of the military continued \u2013 even though it contributed to that Government\u2019s growing unpopularity. The public openly rallied around the Major who was order to pay Rs 2 million as compensation to the family of a terrorist, who was shot dead as he tried to escape arrest. Notwithstanding all these factors \u2013 lack of evidence and public disenchantment \u2013 the Yahapalana Government continued to engage in its agenda.<\/p> <p>The shocking conclusion is the Yahapalana Government was never interested in delivering justice to the victims, alleged or real. They just gave the excuse to hound the MI. Exposing the identity of an MI officer is the best way to end their career. One who works for the MI or any other intelligence unit does not operate in uniform but in anonymity. They must blend with the environment as needed. Until the very public arrests of these officers and men, even their own families did not know their role or responsibility.<\/p> <p>As their identity got exposed, their active networks and ongoing operations were compromised. The roles they play in these operations are built over a long period of time. Thus, it is not possible for one to be replaced with another. Even former officers and men became targets because their actions played a direct role in the LTTE\u2019s downfall. The turning point of the war was when the MI became an active component. The intelligence they gathered and their unique strategies hampered the LTTE.<\/p> <p>As such, the LTTE international network is bitterly angry with the MI. The anger of this network is useful to the West\u2019s and India\u2019s geopolitics that sees use in keeping Sri Lanka destabilised. Keeping the country\u2019s national security weak and dumbing down its intelligence is important for this side of geopolitics. Having come to power on the shoulders of these wicked elements, the Yahapalana Government was beholden to discredit the military and weaken its intelligence.<\/p> <p>The Yahapalana Government was not an unwilling participant. The UNP opposed the war against terrorism, even to the extent of informing every international lending agency that they will not honour the loans given to fund the war. Hence, when terrorism was defeated they too were politically massacred. Their only way out is to discredit the war itself and criminalise those who rendered a great service to the country. Therefore, persecuting the MI and other efforts to imprison Military leaders was very satisfying to these discredited politicians. This was a bonus to the agenda set by their handlers.<\/p> <p>Power over Patriotism<\/p> <p>Premadasa is a victim of the LTTE. His father was assassinated by the LTTE, despite the support he gave them. He, more than any other, should be grateful to the military for ending that era of killing and destruction.<\/p> <p>Yet, even when he met the UK Minister of State Foreign Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, he failed to set the record straight on the alleged war crimes. Lord Ahmad is one of the main British politicians leading the persecution against the Sri Lankan military. He categorically had refused to take into account the records compiled by the British Home Office by the then British Defence Attach\u00e9 Lt Col Anthony Gash simply because it does not fit the narrative against<\/p> <p>Sri Lanka.<\/p> <p>It is truly a sad state of affairs that the regime changes have an heir to carry their mantle \u2013 even after the resolute defeat of the Yahapalana Government.<\/p> <p>ranasingheshivanthi@gmail.com<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3LN50BUKPXQCG1GDOUOUYCIBVSAPLA"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":616,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping","other"],"year":"2008","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"editor, nation newspaper, abduction, 2008","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping","other"],"year":"2008","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"editor, nation newspaper, abduction, 2008","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1006292214,"Input.title":"UN expert likens Belarus to \u2018totalitarian\u2019 states","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Special Rapporteur Anais Marin warns Human Rights Council that Minsk is moving to \u2018purge\u2019 Belarus of all dissent.<\/p> <p>A top UN expert has likened Belarus to \u201ctotalitarian states\u201d, warning that Minsk\u2019s recent grounding of a passenger plane and subsequent arrest of an opposition journalist on board was part of an ongoing effort by officials to \u201cpurge\u201d the country of all dissent.<\/p> <p>Anais Marin, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on the rights situation in the country, told the Human Rights Council on Monday the incident in May \u201cillustrates the desire of authorities to end all forms of dissidence by purging society of elements it considers undesirable\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is a form of purge that recalls those practised by totalitarian states,\u201d she said in a speech at the Geneva-based forum.<\/p> <p>On May 23, Belarusian authorities diverted a Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania and forced it to land in Minsk, which was followed by the arrest of Lukashenko critic Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend.<\/p> <p>Marin added the rights situation was \u201cdeteriorating\u201d in Belarus, which was rocked by months of protests late last year following longtime President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s re-election in an August vote that was widely denounced by his opponents as rigged but handed the 66-year-old a sixth term in office.<\/p> <p>Authorities responded to the demonstrations with a massive crackdown that saw thousands of people arrested and reports of police brutality.

most populous country out of isolation, but his appetite for change may be waning now that he has consolidated power.<\/p> <p>Advertising Read more<\/p> <p>The 64-year-old is expected to sail past four token candidates on Sunday for a second five-year term in the ex-Soviet country whose neighbourhood includes a rising China, resurgent Russia and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev's reforms -- including ending infamous forced labour in the cotton industry -- have been hailed both by long-suffering citizens and foreign observers.<\/p> <p>His hardline mentor and predecessor Islam Karimov, who died in 2016 after ruling for more than a quarter of a century, set a low bar, having gained a reputation for torturing opponents, including by boiling and freezing them.<\/p> <p>Despite changes since Karimov's death unthinkable under his tenure, Mirziyoyev's critics say some recent moves carry echoes of the country's despotic past.<\/p> <p>\"Uzbekistan's political system is still deeply authoritarian,\" Human Rights Watch said this month ahead of the vote.<\/p> <p>\"Since the start of the year, promised human rights reforms have stalled, and in particular in the months leading up to the presidential election, there has been clear backtracking in some areas\".<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev, an energetic grey-haired man, loosened the straitjacketed economy to trade, tourism and foreign investment after taking over power in the 34-million strong republic.<\/p> <p>Ties with neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan -- countries Karimov once threatened with war over hydropower projects -- have improved.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev has advocated pragmatic ties with the Taliban, while trade with Russia and China has grown, even if he has stopped short of rejoining a Moscow-led security bloc.<\/p> <p>His tenure has also seen controls loosened over Islam -- followed by more than 90 percent of the population but viewed with suspicion by Karimov, whom critics accused of tapping the \"war on terror\" to repress devout Muslims.<\/p> <p>Free speech crackdown<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev's most celebrated achievement has been his clampdown on forced labour in the cotton fields, where wages for up to two million pickers have increased year-on-year.<\/p> <p>Authorities hope Western firms will now end a long-standing boycott after the International Labour Organization heralded the end of systemic child labour and forced labour.<\/p> <p>Elsewhere there is more continuity than change, critics argue, suggesting Mirziyoyev might not be the man to totally overhaul Uzbekistan's reputation as a rights abuser.<\/p> <p>A crackdown on critical bloggers, one of whom was sentenced to six and a half years in jail earlier this year, shows there are still plenty of red lines in a country where insulting the president is a criminal offense.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev meanwhile boasted during a recent working trip to the eastern Fergana Valley region that under him, Uzbeks had learned to \"live free, without fear\".<\/p> <p>The public prominence of the eldest of his two daughters, Saida Mirziyoyeva, 36, who held a post in the state communications agency until last year, has drawn comparisons with Karimov's eldest daughter, Gulnara Karimova.<\/p> <p>Karimova, referred to as a \"robber baron\" in leaked US diplomatic cables, is currently jailed on embezzlement and criminal conspiracy charges after falling foul of her father's regime while he was still alive.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev was born in 1957 in the east of Soviet Uzbekistan.<\/p> <p>After studying agricultural engineering, he became a deputy in the legislature aged just 32 and was later entrusted with a series of governorships under Karimov.<\/p> <p>In that role, Mirziyoyev was at the heart of a system that saw civil servants, medics, teachers and even children dispatched to the fields to fulfil government cotton quotas.<\/p> <p>As prime minister from 2003, Mirziyoyev was charged with running a tightly controlled economy that confounded outsiders.<\/p> <p>His role as heir apparent quickly became clear, as he took control of Karimov's funeral arrangements and outmanoeuvred the head of Uzbekistan's notorious security service, Rustam Inoyatov, to become leader.<\/p> <p>Mirziyoyev finally dismissed his rival at the beginning of 2018, paving the way for an opening of Uzbekistan that included visa-free entry for scores of countries and the end of exit visas for its own citizens.<\/p> <p> 2021

I demand an acquittal for myself, for my colleagues, and for the hundreds of political prisoners,\u201d Andreyeva commented in court.<\/p> <p>There was little attempt to present a credible case against the pair. Instead, Belarusian state prosecutors argued that the live stream filmed by the defendants constituted a source of incitement that fueled \u201cviolent protests.\u201d There was an air of inevitability about the subsequent two-year sentences.<\/p> <p>Subscribe for the latest from BelarusAlert Receive updates for events, news, and publications on Belarus from the Atlantic Council. Email *<\/p> <p>Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.<\/p> <p>The convictions provoked an immediate international reaction. US Senator Jim Risch, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted, \u201cIt is shameful that dictator Lukashenka has jailed two journalists for the \u201ccrime\u201d of filming protests against his fraudulent election in Belarus. These brave women, along with others detained, should be immediately released.\u201d<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, a statement from the European Union\u2019s External Action Service noted that this latest incident was part of a far broader and increasingly alarming trend of repression in Belarus. \u201cThe unacceptable harassment of human rights defenders, media workers, trade union representatives, and defense lawyers has escalated in recent days,\u201d the statement noted. \u201cYesterday, two Belsat journalists were sentenced to two years imprisonment on groundless charges. Other media workers are facing a similar fate. Such verdicts aim to intimidate and silence journalists and media workers who are simply doing their jobs, as well as to prevent factual information from reaching the Belarusian people and beyond.\u201d<\/p> <p>Also this week in Minsk, the trial began of another Belarusian journalist, Kaciaryna Barysevich, who is facing charges alongside Belarusian doctor Arciom Sarokin. Both are accused of exposing regime attempts to cover up the killing of activist Raman Bandarenka, with prosecutors bizarrely arguing that the publication of Bandarenka\u2019s medical records constitutes a technical violation of Belarusian privacy laws. Human rights groups expect the trial to be just as farcical as the charges themselves.<\/p> <p>Repressions against Belarus\u2019s small independent media community have continued in parallel to these court proceedings. Earlier this week, multiple members of the Belarusian Association of Journalists were subjected to dawn raids, with plainclothes law enforcement officers conducting searches of their apartments and confiscating computer equipment.<\/p> <p>The events of the past week represent the latest escalation in a long-running campaign against media professionals in Belarus. The Belarusian Association of Journalists claims that 97 of its members have been sentenced to a collective total of around 1,200 days in prison since the start of the country\u2019s pro-democracy protest movement in August 2020. This number does not include the many more reporters and independent bloggers who have been detained over the past six months before being released without facing any official charges.<\/p> <p>Nor are Andreyeva and Chultsova the only journalists to receive significant prison time. There are currently at least 11 Belarusian journalists imprisoned due to their professional activities, along with various bloggers who have incurred the displeasure of the regime.<\/p> <p>The current challenges facing the media in Belarus are extreme, even by the draconian standards of the 26-year Lukashenka dictatorship. \u201cThe situation with press freedom in Belarus has always been hard and the regime has kept independent media in its crosshairs for years,\u201d explains Minsk journalist and Atlantic Council Nonresident Fellow Hanna Liubakova. \u201cHowever, when the protests began last summer, a very real and nasty war was unleashed against journalists and bloggers in Belarus.\u201d<\/p> <p>Liubakova argues that while the current efforts to silence the Belarusian opposition are alarming, they may ultimately prove futile. \u201cLukashenka and his government do not seem to understand that hiding the truth is impossible in today\u2019s technological era,\u201d she notes. \u201cOrdinary citizens post videos or share them with the media. Others leak information or help out in different ways.\u201d<\/p> <p>This is unlikely to deter Lukashenka from continuing to target media professionals guilty of nothing more than attempting to do their jobs. Belarus is now by any measurement among the most dangerous countries in the region, and likely the entire world, for journalists. Indeed, I myself observed masked security men intimidating journalists by filming them during my own reporting from Minsk last summer. By all accounts, the situation has since deteriorated dramatically.<\/p> <p>Many in Belarus are hoping that a robust international response to the latest prison sentences can still have a moderating effect on the authorities. \u201cit is crucial to send a strong signal to the Belarusian regime and to Lukashenka personally that this will not be tolerated,\u201d says Liubakova.<\/p> <p>Vladislav Davidzon is a Nonresident Fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.<\/p> <p>Further reading<\/p> <p>The views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.<\/p> <p>The Eurasia Center\u2019s mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

Xu was arrested in August for allegedly organizing anti-corruption demonstrations, becoming one of the first of several dissidents to recently stand trial under Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on civil society. His translated closing statement is excerpted here:<\/p> <p>You have accused me of disrupting public order for my efforts to push for rights of equal access to education and for reforms allowing migrant workers\u2019 children to sit for university entrance examinations where they reside, as well as for my calls that officials publicly declare their assets. While on the face of it, this appears to be an issue of the boundary between a citizen\u2019s right to free speech and public order, what this is, in fact, is the issue of whether or not you recognize a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights. On a still deeper level, this is actually an issue of fears you all carry within: fear of a public trial, fear of a citizen\u2019s freedom to observe a trial, fear of my name appearing online, and fear of the free society nearly upon us. [\u2026] [While] you have not mentioned the New Citizens\u2019 Movement throughout this trial, many of the documents presented here relate to it, and in my view there is no need to avoid the issue. . . . What the New Citizens\u2019 Movement advocates is for each and every Chinese national to act and behave as a citizen, to accept our roles as citizens and masters of our country\u2014not to act as feudal subjects, remain complacent, and accept mob rule or a position as an underclass. . . . [Source]<\/p> <p>Also at Dissent Magazine, Jeffrey Wasserstrom chairs a roundtable \u201con law, reform and repression in China\u201d with Fordham Law School\u2019s Carl Minzner, lawyer Rebecca Liao, the Open Society Foundations\u2019 Thomas Kellogg, and the UC Irvine School of Law\u2019s Benjamin van Rooij. Liao describes Xu\u2019s trial as \u201cdisappointing\u201d and indicative of a step back for legal reform in China:<\/p> <p>Alas, we found out this month that the party\u2019s attempt to understand and implement legal best practices does not apply to all. The trials of Xu Zhiyong and fellow members of the New Citizens\u2019 Movement he founded are a disappointing, befuddling step back for China\u2019s legal reform program. These are the highest-profile legal proceedings since Bo\u2019s trial, and contrasts between the two could not be starker. Xu\u2019s trial was closed to the public and the media. There was no Weibo feed offering a window into the case. The defense was not able to call or cross-examine witnesses. Xu was summarily cut off midway through his statement to the court. At first blush, it would appear that the party has every incentive to replicate the procedural safeguards and transparency of the Bo trial. An international and domestic audience is also watching Xu\u2019s case and passing judgment on China\u2019s legal system, the linchpin of Xi Jinping\u2019s reform agenda. A major difference, however, between Xu\u2019s and Bo\u2019s cases is that the latter was a matter of political infighting. Though the stakes were high, all parties involved were known quantities to one another, compatriots and colleagues working, at the end of the day, to strengthen the Communist Party. A deal could be struck ahead of time. The party had no such luxury with Xu and therefore believed it had to circumvent legal procedure to retain control of the trial\u2019s messaging. [Source]<\/p> <p>Maya Wang at Human Rights Watch adds that the Chinese government \u201cshould think hard about the road they are taking\u201d when choosing to crackdown on the New Citizens\u2019 Movement:<\/p> <p>The current crackdown is arguably one of the biggest and most concerted in the past twenty years. Ten activists who organize under the banner of Xu\u2019s New Citizens Movement have gone on trial within months\u2014and that is not counting the detentions and imprisonment of many others not even related to the New Citizens effort. At the same time, the government has systematically tightened other contentious spaces for public activism, putting new controls on the Internet, mass media and even universities. Pressure in Tibet and Xinjiang has also intensified, culminating with the arrest of Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti in mid-January for the crime of \u201csplittism.\u201d What makes this latest round of repression distressing is that the message of the rights defense movement and the New Citizens Movement in particular was modest, inclusive and constructive. Xu borrowed the language of the government on the rule of law and justice, and that should have made him less of a threat. The New Citizens Movement never organized opposition parties or explicitly pushed for multi-party democracy, which is the Communist Party\u2019s greatest fear, but Xi Jinping and his new government seem unable to tolerate even moderate critics.

China shut Hong Kong\u2019s last pro-democracy newspaper. Brazil\u2019s government extolled dictatorship. And Belarus hijacked a passenger plane to arrest a journalist.<\/p> <p>COVID-19 has absorbed the world\u2019s energies and isolated countries from one another, which may have accelerated the creep of authoritarianism and extremism across the globe, some researchers and activists believe.<\/p> <p>\u201cCOVID is a dictator\u2019s dream opportunity,\u201d said Theary Seng, a Cambodian-American human rights lawyer who has been indicted on charges including treason in the ostensibly democratic southeast Asian nation, where Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power for more than three decades.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch accuses Cambodia\u2019s government of using the pandemic as cover to imprison political opponents without due process. Scores have been indicted and face mass trials.<\/p> <p>When it comes to government opposition, \u201cthe fear of COVID, on its own and as a political weapon, has substantially restricted mobility for a gathering or movement to take shape,\u201d Seng said.<\/p> <p>The biggest global public health emergency in a century has handed power to government authorities and restricted life for billions of people.<\/p> <p>Luke Cooper, a London School of Economics researcher and author of the book \u201cAuthoritarian Contagion,\u201d said the vast economic, health and social resources poured into fighting the pandemic mean \u201cthe state is back as a force to manage society and to deliver public goods.\u201d<\/p> <p>Restrictions on civil liberties or political opponents have been stepped up during the pandemic on several continents.<\/p> <p>For a decade in Hungary, conservative nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has curtailed media and judicial freedom, criticized multiculturalism and attacked Muslim migrants as a threat to Europe\u2019s Christian identity.<\/p> <p>During the pandemic, Orban\u2019s government brought in an emergency powers bill allowing it to implement resolutions without parliamentary approval -- effectively a license to rule by decree. In June, it passed a law prohibiting the sharing of content portraying homosexuality or sex reassignment with anyone under 18. The government claims the purpose is to protect children from pedophiles, but it effectively outlawed discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools and the media.<\/p> <p>Poland\u2019s conservative government has chipped away at the rights of women and gay people. A ruling last year by a government-controlled court that imposed a near-total ban on abortion triggered a wave of protests that defied a ban on mass gatherings during the virus outbreak.<\/p> <p>In India, the world\u2019s biggest democracy, populist Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of trying to silence voices critical of his administration\u2019s response to a brutal pandemic wave that tore through the country in April and May. His government has arrested journalists and ordered Twitter to remove posts that criticized its handling of the outbreak after introducing sweeping regulations that give it more power to police online content.<\/p> <p>Even before the pandemic, Modi\u2019s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was accused by opponents of squashing dissent and introducing policies aimed at refashioning a multifaith democracy into a Hindu nation that discriminates against Muslims and other minorities.<\/p> <p>In Russia, the government of President Vladimir Putin has used the pandemic as its latest excuse to arrest opposition figures. Associates of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny have been subjected to house arrest and charges that the mass protests against his arrest violated regulations on mass gatherings.<\/p> <p>In neighboring Belarus, authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko extended his quarter-century iron grip on power by winning an August 2020 election that the opposition -- and many Western countries -- said was rigged. The huge protests that erupted were met with tear gas, rubber bullets and mass arrests.<\/p> <p>Then, in May, a Ryanair plane flying from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in the Belarusian capital of Minsk after the crew was told of an alleged threat. Opposition journalist Raman Pratasevic, a passenger, was taken off the plane along with his girlfriend and arrested.<\/p> <p>Western nations called the forced diversion a brazen hijacking and slapped sanctions on Belarus, but those seem unlikely to induce Lukashenko to change his ways and underscore the weakness of democracies in confronting hardline regimes. Hungary\u2019s acts have drawn sharp words from fellow European Union leaders, but the 27-nation bloc has no unified response to restrictive regimes like those in Hungary or Poland.<\/p> <p>Even before COVID-19 came along, extremism was on the march.<\/p> <p>\u201cOver the last 15 years, authoritarian politics has replicated all over the world,\u201d Cooper said.<\/p> <p>\u201cDemocracy feels very fragile. Democracy doesn\u2019t have a clear vision for what it\u2019s trying to do in the 21st century.\u201d<\/p> <p>The 2008 global financial crisis, which saw governments pump billions into teetering banks, shook confidence in the Western world order. And the years of recession and government austerity that followed boosted populism in Europe and North America.<\/p> <p>In China, authorities saw the 2008 economic crash as evidence that they, and not the world\u2019s democracies, were on the right path.<\/p> <p>Historian Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Center, said the crisis persuaded China\u2019s communist government that \u201cthe West no longer had lessons to teach them.\u201d Since then, Beijing has increasingly flexed China\u2019s economic muscle abroad while cracking down on opposition inside its borders.<\/p> <p>In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uyghurs have been confined in re-education camps in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region, where activists and former detainees accuse authorities of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control and torture. Beijing instead characterizes the camps as vocational training centers.<\/p> <p>Beijing also has tightened control on Hong Kong, stifling dissent in the former British colony. Protesters, publishers and journalists critical of Beijing have been jailed and the last remaining pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, stopped publishing in June after the arrest of its top editors and executives.<\/p> <p>When the coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, authorities responded firmly -- though far from transparently -- with draconian lockdowns that got the virus in check.<\/p> <p>Mitter said the pandemic has cemented a view -- among many ordinary Chinese, as well as the country\u2019s leaders -- \u201cthat something had gone very wrong in terms of the way in which the democratic world had dealt with the virus, and something had gone right in China.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThat is now being used very much as a lesson, not just about the pandemic, but about the virtues of China\u2019s system as opposed to the systems of liberal countries,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Last year, curfews and travel restrictions also became commonplace across Europe. People in France needed to show a signed declaration to travel more than 1 kilometer (just over a half-mile) from home. And Britons were banned by law from going on vacation abroad, while some attendees at a London vigil for a murdered woman were arrested for gathering illegally.<\/p> <p>British lawmakers have expressed concern about the scope of the Conservative government\u2019s emergency powers, many passed without debate in Parliament.<\/p> <p>\u201cSince March 2020, the government has introduced a large volume of new legislation, much of it transforming everyday life and introducing unprecedented restrictions on ordinary activities,\u201d said Ann Taylor, an opposition Labour Party politician who chairs the House of Lords Constitution Committee. \u201cYet parliamentary oversight of these significant policy decisions has been extremely limited.\u201d<\/p> <p>Politicians and intelligence agencies in the West also have warned of the threat from coronavirus conspiracy theories that dovetail with existing extremist narratives. Many countries have seen large anti-lockdown, anti-mask, anti-vaccine protests attended by a mix of the far right, the far left and assorted conspiracists.<\/p> <p>The British government has warned of \u201cextremists exploiting the crisis to sow division and undermine the social fabric of our country,\u201d with different hate groups variously blaming Muslims, Jews and 5G phone technology for the pandemic.<\/p> <p>But there are signs of fighting back. The pandemic also has boosted trust in scientists and spurred demands for more accountable political leadership.<\/p> <p>In Hungary, which has one of the world\u2019s highest per-capita coronavirus death rates, there is growing opposition both to the government\u2019s pandemic policies and to its wider authoritarian thrust, and thousands have taken to the streets in support of academic freedom and LGBT rights. With an election due in 2022, a six-party opposition coalition has united to try to unseat Orban\u2019s Fidesz party.<\/p> <p>Both extremism and resistance can be seen in Brazil where the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has expressed nostalgia for the country\u2019s two-decade military dictatorship and last year attended protests against the country\u2019s courts and Congress. He dismissed the virus as a \u201clittle flu,\u201d cast doubt on the effectiveness of vaccines and opposed social and economic restrictions.<\/p> <p>Renato Meirelles, director of Brazilian polling company Locomotive Institute, said authoritarianism had advanced through \u201ca strategy of fake news and attacks on factual truth.\u201d \u201cThe next step will be questioning the electronic vote and, as such, the result of the next election,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Bolsonaro has so far been held in check by Brazil\u2019s institutions, especially the Supreme Court, which stopped him from preventing states and cities from implementing restrictions to curb COVID-19 and has ordered an inquiry into the government\u2019s pandemic response.

Sanctions against alleged perpetrators where there is strong evidence of serious abuses are among the measures recommended to strengthen accountability.<\/p> <p>There has been a flurry of activity by the regime and its critics in the run up to the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). This is due to run from February 28 to April 1 2022, including a discussion on March 3 on Sri Lanka. In March 2021, a resolution highly critical of the regime\u2019s treatment of ordinary Sri Lankans was passed the UNHRC. The Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, was asked to monitor the situation and report back.<\/p> <p>While the government has made much of its proposed reforms to the harsh Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the recent update on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka suggests that these are inadequate. Meanwhile, in the light of the Rajapaksa government\u2019s failure to bring perpetrators of serious crimes to book, others abroad are beginning to step in, a trend which will intensify. On February 24, the day before the advance unedited version of the report was published, British war crimes police arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of a Tamil journalist, Mylvaganam Nimalrajan who was murdered in his home in Jaffna in October 2000.<\/p> <p>The crisis caused by the Russian state\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will overshadow the UNHRC\u2019s gathering. It has also added to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic instability, caused in part by mismanagement, and further undermined confidence in the political leadership, on top of the impact of other scandals. As Foreign Minister G.L. Peiris and his colleagues seek to win support from overseas governments and international institutions, the pressure to make more substantial changes will increase.<\/p> <p>A grave situation<\/p> <p>Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka mentions the impact of the economic crisis, including food poverty, and overall paints a sobering picture a year after the previous report, indicating that the hoped-for progress has not materialised. Issues include erosion of the independence of public bodies such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and Right to Information Commission. Civilian government functions are increasingly being militarised; in some cases, current or former military officers \u2013 including some accused of serious human rights violations \u2013 have been placed in senior positions in ministries.<\/p> <p>While some of the land that the army took in the North and East during the civil war has been returned, further disputes have arisen. Some are a linked to a Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management in the Eastern Province headed by the Defence Secretary, supposedly seeking to preserve Buddhist sites but in practice resulting in takeover of local people\u2019s land. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa spoke at the UN General Assembly of the Government\u2019s \u201cfirm intention to build a prosperous, stable and secure future for all Sri Lankans, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender.\u201d Yet in reality, Ms. Bachelet suggests, \u201cactions by the Government during the past year have reinforced the nexus between Sinhalese nationalism, Buddhism and the state, increasing the sense of marginalisation and anxiety among Tamil, Muslim and Christian minority communities, and undermining the prospects for reconciliation.\u201d<\/p> <p>A Task Force on legal change headed by the leader of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), which is a \u201cBuddhist\u201d extremist organisation notorious for hate speech and worse, a statue of the Buddha put up (despite a court order) on what is believed to be the site of an ancient Hindu temple, measures targeting Muslims and failure to protect churches from attack are examples.<\/p> <p>The report describes how civil society organisations, victim groups and human rights advocates are being targeted. The High Commissioner welcomed moves to reduce prison overcrowding during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the release of pre-trial detainees on bail. But suspicious deaths in custody have continued, along with torture and other mistreatment of those imprisoned or detained. A PTA Amendment Bill was brought before Parliament in February 2022, with some positive aspects but still falling far short of meeting international human rights obligations; arbitrary detention and torture are still far too easy.<\/p> <p>While some longstanding detainees have been released, other people were still being locked up under the PTA and Ms. Bachelet again called for a stop to its use until replaced by a more just law. In March 2021 new de-radicalisation regulations had been added so that people could be detained for up to two years without a case going before a court.<\/p> <p>Inadequate progress in reconciliation and accountability<\/p> <p>With regard to allegations of past abuses, \u201cThe High Commissioner is gravely concerned about the continuing precarious situation of the families of the disappeared \u2013 the majority of whom are represented by women. In addition to their suffering and anguish in not knowing the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones, they continue to struggle with the desperate economic and social consequences this has had on their lives,\u201d made worse by harassment and surveillance.<\/p> <p>Some payments have been made to those whose lives have been damaged by past violence but detailed information is lacking and there have been workshops aimed at reconciliation yet, the report suggests, justice is crucial.<\/p> <p>The dropping of charges against a former Navy commander for his involvement in the abduction and disappearance of 11 boys and men in 2008 and 2009, who was then appointed as the Governor of the North Western Province, again signals an unwillingness to address grave abuses. Failure to investigate more fully the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, including the role of security forces, is another concern.<\/p> <p>The report explains that the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights has been recruiting specialist staff and compiling information on alleged abuses by both the state and other groups (the UN has consistently condemned the Tigers too for violating human rights).<\/p> <p>Facing the challenge<\/p> <p>One paragraph that has been the focus of wide attention raises the issue of what can be done by the international community to acknowledge and respond to the suffering of those harmed by the regime\u2019s failures. It states, \u201cThe High Commissioner\u2019s previous report recommended that, among a range of measures, Member States explore possible targeted sanctions against credibly alleged perpetrators of grave human rights violations and abuses. On 10 December 2021, the United States Government announced that two Sri Lankan military officers implicated in grave violations would be designated under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation Act, 2021 and ineligible for entry to that country.\u201d Not surprisingly, talk of sanctions has been met with strong reactions.<\/p> <p>The report points out that this is a major piece of work and the extent of what can be achieved will largely depend on the support of members states and level of funding.<\/p> <p>The conclusions underline the fact that human rights abuses and threats to democracy are not only historical: \u201cIn the last two years, the independence of the judiciary, the Human Rights Commission and other key institutions have been eroded, and democratic space, including for human rights advocacy constricted. There has been a further drift towards militarisation and an emphasis of Sinhala nationalism and Buddhism in State institutions has become more visible, increasing the marginalisation and uncertainty of minority communities, and undermining reconciliation. The forthcoming Constitution drafting process will be of critical importance for the independence of key institutions and issues of devolution and human rights should be monitored closely.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ms. Bachelet recognises signs of renewed openness of the government in engaging with her office and initial steps towards reform, including changes to the PTA but urges the government to go further and deeper. Although the government emphasises reparation and development, a broader approach is vital, according to the report.<\/p> <p>There are a range of recommendations for the Sri Lankan authorities to strengthen human rights, as well as some aimed at the international community. These include working with victims to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed by all parties, continuing to explore possible targeted sanctions against those facing credible allegations of grave violations and protecting asylum seekers at risk if sent back.<\/p> <p>The government disputes the accuracy of the report; however the claims made tie in with other findings from organisations gathering and analysing evidence on human rights in Sri Lanka. Foreign Minister G.L. Peiris is due to lead Sri Lanka\u2019s delegation to UNHRC and speak during the interactive dialogue on March 3.<\/p> <p>As yet more information comes to light about the scale and gravity of the wrongs done to ordinary Sri Lankans by people misusing power, it will become increasingly hard to ignore the calls for truth and justice as a foundation for healing and rebuilding.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3VLL1PIENS3E0QLGOV2OHROJ0WMZOM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":674,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["killing"],"year":"2000","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jafna","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mylvaganam Nimalrajan","victim_keywords":"Tamil, journalist, murder","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil society organisations, human rights, journalists, activists, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["killing"],"year":"2000","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jafna","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mylvaganam Nimalrajan","victim_keywords":"Tamil, journalist, murder","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil society organisations, human rights, journalists, activists, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":944913281,"Input.title":"Abducted Jewish Businessman Rescued from Captivity by Kyiv Police","Input.publish_date":"2020-09-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Photo Credit: Wikimedia \/ Thez<\/p> <p>A Jewish businessman who was abducted outside the Brodsky synagogue in Kyiv and held a week for ransom, was rescued by Ukraine Police, the United Jewish Community of Ukraine announced Tuesday on the organization\u2019s website.<\/p> <p>The victim, whose name was not released, was kidnapped on August 21 by a gang of criminals allegedly led by his former business partner, according to Kyiv Chief of Police Andriy Krishchenko, who discussed the details of the case with the Obozrevatel website in an interview.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>An acquaintance who was among the group of kidnappers lured him into a car outside his synagogue, according to Kirshchenko.

It declined to extend its order to federal courts in the two other southern border states \u2014 New Mexico and Texas.<\/p> <p>Judges William Fletcher and Richard Paez, both appointed by President Bill Clinton, said they acknowledged that nationwide orders applied to places outside a court's jurisdiction are \u201ca matter of intense and active controversy.\u201d<\/p> <p>They reaffirmed their view that the policy, known officially as \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols,\u201d is illegal under U.S. law to prevent sending people to countries where their lives or freedom would be threatened because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a particular social group.<\/p> <p>There is no question about \u201cthe extreme danger to asylum seekers who are returned to Mexico,\" they wrote.<\/p> <p>Ad<\/p> <p>Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, disagreed with blocking the policy at all.<\/p> <p>Judy Rabinovitz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to end the policy, emphasized the majority's opinion that it's illegal.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf the administration had any respect for the law or any sense of decency, it would end this program immediately,\u201d she said. \"We will continue working to permanently end this illegal and inhumane policy.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Justice Department declined to comment. In a court filing Tuesday, it warned of \u201cmassive disruption to the government\u2019s immigration operations and sudden confusion for thousands of migrants about their ability to enter the United States. \u201d<\/p> <p>About 60,000 asylum-seekers have been returned to Mexico to wait for their cases to wind through clogged U.S. immigration courts since the policy was introduced in January 2019 in San Diego and later expanded across the border.<\/p> <p>Ad<\/p> <p>Human Rights First, an advocacy group that opposes the policy, said it found more than 1,000 public reports of kidnappings, torture, rape and assaults of asylum-seekers returned to Mexico.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"39RRBHZ0AWG9QAUDP7O2CJIRWPJZVO"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":289,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["kidnapping","other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mexico","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"asylum-seekers, immigrants, Mexican-American border","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["kidnapping","other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mexico","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"asylum-seekers, immigrants, Mexican-American border","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":997486090,"Input.title":"RAP AGAINST THE JUNTA \u2013 \u201cYou Will Be Held Accountable\u2026\u201d","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-01 07:35:26","Input.article_interface":"<p>By Conor Phelan*<\/p> <p>The government has restricted access to social media and the internet.

In 2018, He Qian alleged that Deng Fei groped her while she was a 21-year-old intern and he was chief reporter for Phoenix Weekly. Deng then sued He for defamation. A Hangzhou court concurred with Deng, ordering He Qian and Zou Sicong, who published her accusations on his website, to pay Deng $1,813 in damages. Her case bears obvious similarities to that of prominent #MeToo activist Xianzi, who last month appeared in court to press sexual harassment charges against CCTV anchor Zhu Jun. Public awareness surrounding gender violence rose sharply in 2020, especially after pop star Tan Weiwei released her single \u201cXiao Juan (Pseudonym),\u201d which documented a litany of violent (and often unprosecuted) crimes perpetrated against women. For The Associated Press, Huizhong Wu reported on He Qian\u2019s plight, and the difficulty victims of sexual assault have proving their case in court:<\/p> <p>A court in the eastern city of Hangzhou ruled Tuesday that the evidence provided by Zou Sicong and He Qian against prominent journalist Deng Fei was \u201cnot enough to allow someone to firmly believe without any hesitation that what was described truly happened.\u201d [\u2026] Throughout the process, Zou and He said they faced a higher burden of proof under Chinese law. Although China allowed sexual misconduct as a ground for lawsuits in 2019, the definition of such harassment remains murky and very few cases are filed. Many have been prosecuted in courts as labor disputes or under laws to protect public reputations. [\u2026] \u201cThis is equal to telling someone who was humiliated, who was hurt, that if you don\u2019t have audio recordings or videos of the event, then you better hurry up and shut your mouth,\u201d Zou\u2019s and He\u2019s lawyer, Xu Kai, said in a statement. \u201cThe court had imposed the entire burden of proof on Zou Sicong and He Qian.\u201d [\u2026] Zhou Xiaoxuan [also known as Xianzi], the face of one of China\u2019s most high-profile #MeToo cases, said she did not see the ruling as a defeat. \u201cIt was very brave then for He Qian to speak out about this with her real name. She did this for the rights of other women.\u201d [Source]<\/p> <p>At The New York Times, Javier C. Hern\u00e1ndez interviewed He Qian and Zou Sicong, the two defendants:<\/p> <p>\u201cChinese law needs to do more to respond to #MeToo,\u201d Ms. He, who also uses the first name Belinda, said in an interview. \u201cThis is only the beginning and far from enough.\u201d [\u2026] Mr. Zou said Chinese law should be more responsive to women who bring forward allegations of assault and harassment. \u201cHoping a topic will just disappear and return to the old world is ignorant and peremptory,\u201d he wrote on WeChat, a popular social media app. \u201cI will take responsibility until the end for publishing the article about He Qian.\u201d [\u2026] Feng Yuan, a co-founder of a women\u2019s rights nonprofit group in Beijing, said the court had \u201ccompletely denied the existence of sexual harassment.\u201d \u201cMany people will feel even more powerless in the face of sexual harassment,\u201d Ms. Feng said.

The World Economic Forum places China above South Korea and Japan in its ranking of countries by gender equality. But since Xi Jinping became China\u2019s leader in 2012 his country has fallen from 69th to 106th on that list, below Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Despite this, more women than ever in China are gaining degrees. In 2009, for the first time, the number of female undergraduates surpassed those who were male. Since then women have retained this majority. Young highly educated women have been at the forefront of China\u2019s #MeToo movement. Their demands for rights as women are \u201cvery difficult to suppress\u201d, says Wang Zheng of the University of Michigan. The Communist Party accuses \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d of stoking such advocacy. In 2015 police arrested a group of women merely for planning to hand out stickers about sexual harassment on public transport. The \u201cfeminist five\u201d, as they became known, were released only after weeks in prison, and after news of their plight had sparked outrage in China and abroad. When visiting the state-backed All-China Women\u2019s Federation in 2018, President Xi said the organisation \u201cabsolutely must not become one of those organisations like they have in other countries for feminists or posh women\u201d. Though stifled by the government, campaigning has made some impact. \u201cPrior to #MeToo, discussions about women and gender in mainstream media and on social media were quite limited,\u201d says Zhang Zhiqi, the host of a podcast popular among feminists in China. \u201cThere\u2019s now a lot more awareness about gender equality and I think that\u2019s due to #MeToo.\u201d [Source]<\/p> <p>At ChinaFile, Shen Lu investigated the glaring gender disparities in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ranks, which belie the Party\u2019s own claims to upholding gender equality:<\/p> <p>According to the state-sponsored All-China Women\u2019s Federation, women comprise 37.5 percent of the 4 million members of the Party\u2019s neighborhood and village committees, which enforce Party mandates and maintain social order. But, the higher women move up the rungs of government hierarchy, the fewer their female peers. Less than 9 percent of Party secretaries and heads of local governments at the provincial, municipal, and county levels are women. At the county level, women make up 9.33 percent of leadership, 5.29 percent at the city-level, and 3.23 percent at the provincial level. [\u2026] This data was last updated in 2017. [\u2026] Women don\u2019t enjoy equal representation in the Party\u2019s rank and file, either. As of 2018, they made up 27 percent of China\u2019s 90 million Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. [\u2026] But while Chinese women\u2019s overall political representation has improved over the years, women still barely appear in positions of government and Party leadership, and seldom rise above the rank of deputy, according to data from the All-China Women\u2019s Federation and National Bureau of Statistics. Currently, out of China\u2019s 31 provincial governors, only two are women. In November, Shen Yiqin was promoted to Party secretary of Guizhou province, becoming China\u2019s sole female provincial Party secretary, a position that is \u201cthe most important stepping stone to a Politburo seat,\u201d according to Cheng Li, director of The Brookings Institution\u2019s China Center. The two female provincial governors and one Party secretary make 4.84 percent of all governors and secretaries, an improvement from just the two governors, or 3.23 percent, in 2017. [\u2026] Indeed, data compiled by the international affairs scholars David Bulman and Kyle Jaros on the tenures and backgrounds of Provincial Party Standing Committee (PPSC) members between 1996 and 2017 show that female cadres disproportionately headed entities such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (41 percent) and United Front Work Department (26 percent). \u201cThese assignments imply that the Party perceives female cadre comparative advantage through traditionally gendered lenses: Female cadres are effective communicators and dialogue facilitators rather than leaders in their own right,\u201d Bulman says. By contrast, women are underrepresented in functional departments where ultimate power resides. While 7.5 percent of all PPSC members were female, only 0.7 percent of Party secretaries and 6.2 percent of deputy Party secretaries were women, during those 21 years.

Chizi, a popular male contestant on \u201cRock and Roast\u201d with a penchant for boorish jokes about women, sniffed that Ms Yang was \u201cnot performing comedy\u201d. Guo Degang, a master of xiangsheng, a witty and often bawdy form of traditional comedy involving banter between two people, recently said he would not recruit women for his troupe (\u201cout of respect\u201d, he said). Very few women perform xiangsheng. [\u2026] The show, which began in 2017, has been a boost for Chinese stand-up and female participation in it. Evangeline Z says the form of comedy is \u201chuge\u201d in Shanghai. And she reckons up to half of the city\u2019s 50-odd weekly performances are by women. But male and female comics alike warn spectators that what they are about to say could be offensive and they should not take offence. Xiao Ju, a 22-year-old part-time comedian, also in Shanghai, says that showgoers expect to come in for \u201ca bit of easy laughter\u201d, so are ruffled when the ribbing reveals something about themselves. Female comedians elicit stronger reactions from the audience than male ones, says Xiao Ju. Many people are still shocked when women swear on stage. A gag about a prostitute told by a male comic draws tuts if delivered by a woman. \u201cSex is a perilous topic,\u201d says Xiao Ju. \u201cSo are shit, piss and farts. If a man jokes about these, everyone laughs. If a woman does, she is disgusting.\u201d For fear of offending, many stick to crowd-pleasing themes like families and jobs. [Source]<\/p> <p>Star comedian Yang Li was trending again for her new performance in which she wrapped up how roasting men had got her fame as well as hate in 2020.

But after the pilot announced the plane had been diverted to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, one passenger \u2014 Roman Protasevich, a prominent Belarusian opposition journalist who had been living in exile since 2019 \u2014 grew terrified, certain that he faced arrest.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe panicked because we were about to land in Minsk,\u201d Marius Rutkauskas, who was sitting one row ahead of Protasevich, told the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT upon arrival in Vilnius.<\/p> <p>Sunday\u2019s ordeal \u2014 described by many European officials as an extraordinary, state-sponsored hijacking by Belarus to seize Protasevich \u2014 quickly led to one of the most severe East-West flare-ups in recent years.<\/p> <p>Meeting Monday evening in Brussels, European Union leaders called on all EU-based airlines to stop flying over Belarus and began the process of banning Belarusian airlines from flying over the bloc\u2019s airspace or landing in its airports \u2014 effectively severing the country\u2019s direct air connections to Western Europe.<\/p> <p>The measures represented a harsh Western broadside against Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus\u2019 authoritarian president, who is already under EU sanctions for rights violations over his brutal repression of protests last year. There was no indication, however, that the intensified squeeze would alter Lukashenko\u2019s resolve \u2014 especially with President Vladimir Putin of Russia steadfast in his support.<\/p> <p>On the contrary, Lukashenko on Monday tightened restrictions on dissent even further, signing new laws that banned things like online livestreams from unauthorised protests.<\/p> <p>\u201cLukashenko does not see it necessary to bow to the West\u2019s demands \u2014 he has Russia, which he relies on,\u201d said Artyom Shraibman, a Minsk-based nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cHe has not been cornered.\u201d<\/p> <p>The moves came as new details trickled out suggesting that the landing of the Ryanair Boeing 737-800 in Minsk on Sunday was an elaborately staged operation, with a bomb hoax and a fighter jet scrambled by Lukashenko to escort the airliner. The Lithuanian police said that of the 126 passengers who took off from Athens, five stayed behind in Minsk \u2014 Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who were both detained, plus three unidentified individuals.<\/p> <p>One Lithuanian official said the three included two Belarusian citizens and one Greek. But uncertainty about their identities raised questions over whether they had any role in the operation.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well,\u201d Michael O\u2019Leary, the CEO of Ireland-based Ryanair, told Irish radio Monday. \u201cThis was a case of state-sponsored hijacking.\u201d<\/p> <p>Belarusian state television broadcast a report rejecting the idea there were KGB agents on the plane, instead showing three people who said on camera that they had decided to stay in Minsk by their own choosing. They included a Greek man who said he had been traveling to Vilnius on his way to visit his wife in Minsk.<\/p> <p>In Lithuania, the police launched an investigation on suspicion of hijacking and kidnapping, and interviewed passengers and crew. They were told that the fighter jet dispatched by Lukashenko to escort the flight had not forced the Ryanair plane to land, according to people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorised to speak publicly.<\/p> <p>Instead, these people said, the pilot had decided to land the plane in Minsk after Belarusian air traffic control had requested that he do so because of a bomb threat on board.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe decision was made by the captain of the liner after consulting with Ryanair management,\u201d Rolandas Kiskis, head of the Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau, told reporters in Vilnius.<\/p> <p>But no bomb was discovered, contributing to accusations that it was all a ruse to get the plane to land.<\/p> <p>The arrested journalist, Protasevich, who co-founded an account on the social media app Telegram that helped galvanise and coordinate the mass protests against Lukashenko last year, had been placed on a list of terrorists by the KGB, Belarus\u2019 intelligence service, still known by its Soviet-era initials.<\/p> <p>A pro-Lukashenko Telegram account posted a 29-second video of Protasevich late Monday evening. It showed him sitting with arms folded at a wooden desk, telling the camera that he is in Minsk\u2019s central Detention Center No. 1 and is being treated \u201cwith maximum correctness.\u201d It was reminiscent of other confessional videos that critics of Lukashenko have been forced to record while in jail.<\/p> <p>\u201cI continue to cooperate with the investigation and am giving confessional testimony on charges of organising mass unrest in the city of Minsk,\u201d Protasevich said.<\/p> <p>The video was the latest sign that Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, did not intend to shirk from confrontation with the West. An official in the Belarus Transportation Ministry, Artyom Sikorsky, on Monday doubled down on Minsk\u2019s official version of events: that the plane had been diverted because of a bomb threat. He read out an email that he said had been sent to the Minsk airport from someone who claimed to be representing Hamas \u2014 the Palestinian militant group \u2014 threatening to punish the European Union for supporting Israel in the recent war. (Hamas denied any connection to the incident, Reuters reported.)<\/p> <p>By the end of the day, Lukashenko had plunged headfirst into yet another diplomatic showdown. He expelled the ambassador and the entire diplomatic staff of neighbouring Latvia from Minsk in response to the mayor of Riga, Latvia, hoisting the white-red-white flag of the Belarusian opposition.<\/p> <p>A prime reason for Lukashenko\u2019s apparent confidence was seen in Moscow, where Russian officials and pro-Kremlin commentators lined up to voice their support.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe consider this issue to be a domestic affair of Belarus,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokesperson, said, according to Interfax. \u201cThe actions of the Belarusian aviation authorities were in line with international standards.\u201d<\/p> <p>The International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, has said the Belarus action may have violated a long-standing treaty that has governed commercial airlines for decades. The organisation called an urgent meeting for Thursday to discuss it.<\/p> <p>In recent years, Lukashenko had profited by playing the interests of Russia and the West off against one another. But amid last summer\u2019s popular uprising against him over his disputed reelection, Lukashenko threw in his lot with Putin \u2014 and has relied on his support ever since.<\/p> <p>Last year, the European Union sanctioned Belarus officials \u2014 including Lukashenko \u2014 over human rights abuses, to little apparent effect. The flight bans could have a greater impact, at least on regular people; the summer 2021 timetable of Belavia, Belarus\u2019 national carrier, includes flights to 20 EU cities.<\/p> <p>And some analysts said the restrictions could require costly rerouting for European airlines, which are already avoiding parts of Ukraine, Belarus\u2019 southern neighbour, because of conflict with Russia.<\/p> <p>The flight bans could cause new problems for Lukashenko inside his country, where the ease of travel to the neighbouring European Union had long softened the strictures of living inside an authoritarian state. Ukraine, which is not a member of the EU, also said it would ban flights to and from Belarus. The growing isolation means that Belarusians will increasingly need to travel east to Russia in order to get out of the country.<\/p> <p>Yevgeny Lipkovich, a popular Minsk-based blogger and commentator critical of Lukashenko, said that his own travels abroad had allowed him to \u201cremain an optimist, despite the regime\u2019s best efforts to force me into depression.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cIf they close down the air loophole, there\u2019s no question that the pressure inside the country will increase,\u201d Lipkovich said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s disgusting to live in a pariah state.\u201d<\/p> <p> 2021 The New York Times Company<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3T2HW4QDUXMYLA60USZY93S9WFF9CK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":587,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"05","date":"23.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roman Protasevich","victim_keywords":"blogger, anti-Lushenko, activist, Belarus, Ryanair, diverted flight","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"05","date":"23.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roman Protasevich","victim_keywords":"blogger, anti-Lushenko, activist, Belarus, Ryanair, diverted flight","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":980413594,"Input.title":"Fighting the drug menace through advocacy","Input.publish_date":"2021-04-18 07:25:49+01:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By Nicholas Kalu, Abuja<\/p> <p>Since Brig Gen Buba Marwa assumed office as the new chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), about three months ago, it is starkly clear there is something different about the agency.<\/p> <p>From headlines across various news outlets on a string of major drug busts and arrests to a surge in activities at their Gimbiya Street Headquarters in Abuja, it is easy to tell there is more verve.<\/p> <p>Activities seemed to have picked up with a frenzy that sharply contrasted with a lethargy that seemed to have enveloped the essence of the anti-drug agency before now. Things are not as they used to be at the NDLEA.<\/p> <p>On his first day in office on January 18, 2021, Marwa had already started wielding the big stick. It would no longer be business as usual he had warned everyone involved in the illicit drug business.<\/p> <p>He had said the agency would be overhauled and expanded, in line with the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Drug Abuse (PACEDA).<\/p> <p>The new chairman, who had served as chairman of PACEDA, said it will also be within existing financial constraints, and the authorization of the appropriate superior authorities.<\/p> <p>Marwa had said the number of drug users in Nigeria today is over 15 million people, across all ages, adding that the problem has eaten very deeply into the social fabric as every community in Nigeria is affected.<\/p> <p>He said as a lead agency in the drug war in Nigeria, they were familiar with the extent of the devastation that drug use has caused the nation, and vowed to resuscitate and reposition NDLEA to full active life, to be effective, respected and feared by concerned criminals.<\/p> <p>Read Also: Minister assures on creation of 100m jobs<\/p> <p>Many stakeholders had upon Marwa\u2019s assumption of office stakeholders had welcomed the development, describing him as a square peg in a square hole.<\/p> <p>For instance, the African Council on Narcotics has lauded the appointment, describing it as \u201cone of the best national appointments that has been made by the present administration.\u201d<\/p> <p>President of the Council, Rekpene Bassey, in a statement in Abuja said it was an appointment well deserved given Marwa\u2019s known track record of excellent performance in previous national appointments.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhile we feel certain that your present position will not be an exception, we note here the assurances of our prayers, trusting God will help you succeed in the massive task ahead considering the frightening increase in the illicit drug problem in our country. Needless to say, we will be more than delighted to work with your good self on this onerous task in the hope that you will leave the NDLEA better than you met it,\u201d Bassey had said.<\/p> <p>Marwa, it appeared, hit the ground running by summoning Commanders of the agency in all the states of the federation and special commands with marching orders to mop up illicit drugs across the country.<\/p> <p>He went ahead to distribute operational vehicles that had been lying fallow at the agency\u2019s headquarters for a long time, to some states that needed them.<\/p> <p>A flurry of drug busts and arrests on a scale hitherto absent had followed in the first month of his assumption of office.<\/p> <p>Seeming to want to identify with a more proactive spirit, various international organizations had already pledged their cooperation to the agency to achieve its mandate. Various alliances \u2013 national and international -have also been pursued by the Agency towards fighting the battle against drugs.<\/p> <p>Still in the spirit of building alliances towards the ultimate aim of ridding the country of the menace of drug abuse, Marwa recently visited the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Abuja, to explore areas of collaboration.<\/p> <p>In the meeting, the NDLEA Boss pointed out that as much as the agency\u2019s efforts were disrupting the drug supply chain through law enforcement, they also needed to be more proactive and work hard on drug demand reduction through advocacy programmes, which are mostly publicity driven.<\/p> <p>The visit, he said, was to leverage on the Minister\u2019s position to drive their advocacy programmes at little or no cost because it is well known that the NDLEA has over the years been left behind in terms of funding among other law enforcement agencies including those established years after them.<\/p> <p>Marwa however noted that despite their constraints, the Agency has in less than three months with him on the saddle, been able to seize drugs and cash worth over N75 billion.<\/p> <p>Within the period 2,175 drug traffickers had been arrested while 2,050,766.33 kilogrammes of assorted illicit drugs had been seized. Also 2,000 drug cases had been filed in court with 329 convictions and 1,549 pending cases, he revealed.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese figures are less than what could have been on the streets destroying the lives of innocent youths, our women and men. With the support of your office and those of your agencies, we\u2019ll be able to save millions of Nigerians from being afflicted with the menace of drug abuse,\u201d Marwa said.<\/p> <p>The NDLEA boss acknowledged the efforts of the Minister and leading agencies under him, in promoting the good work of the federal government and the country as a whole.<\/p> <p>\u201cNo doubt, the Minister\u2019s current role is central to all key activities of government and the agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration, especially with key information dissemination media outlets like the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), the Voice of Nigeria (VON) and more under the supervision of the Honourable Minister,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>He acknowledged that even without any prompting from the Minister, these agencies have been of tremendous support since he came on board.<\/p> <p>He said Nigeria is faced with a major drug crisis that is in no small way fueling most of the security challenges being faced in the North East, North West, North Central and indeed across the country.<\/p> <p>He noted that recently, through intelligence based operations, they were able to arrest some drug traffickers \u2013 one a Nigerien and another a Chadian in Niger state and Taraba state respectively \u2013 who supplied illicit drugs to insurgents and bandits.<\/p> <p>He again stressed the need to proactively combat the problem not just through enforcement but through advocacy.<\/p> <p>\u201cFor instance, we need to run a weekly 30mins network programme on NTA and Radio Nigeria to reach Nigerians on the dangers of drug abuse; we need to reach those at the grassroots with our messages in various Nigerian languages packaged in jingles; we need coverage of our programmes to promote the coming World Drug Day on June 26 and others.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to pay for all of these and this is why we need partnership with the Ministry of Information and its Agencies to be able to reach millions of Nigerians and save them from the drug scourge,\u201d Marwa appealed.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who assured the agency of support, commended Marwa for his impressive string of achievements, in less than three months of assuming office.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese achievements, I am reliably informed, include restoring the visibility of the NDLEA for local and international partnership; boosting the morale and confidence of staffers; attracting international support and \u2018offensive action\u2019 against drug cartels<\/p> <p>that has led to the arrest of 2,175 drug traffickers, seizure of 2,050,765.33 kilogrammes of illicit drugs as well as cash and drug seizures worth N75 billion,\u201d Mohammed said.<\/p> <p>Mohammed said the war against illicit drugs and tackling drug trafficking is one of the most important tasks in the country.<\/p> <p>This he said is because drug trafficking, money laundering by traffickers and the use of illicit drugs are closely linked to the nation\u2019s security, well being of the citizens, the moral fabric of our society and even governance.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is common knowledge that drug money can be used to finance insurgency and terrorism. A successful fight against drug trafficking will therefore help to deny or reduce funding for insurgency.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe kind of vicious banditry and kidnapping for ransom that our country has witnessed in recent times cannot be totally separated from illicit drug use and their effects on users who take to crime<\/p> <p>\u201cDrug trafficking proceeds are sometimes invested into legitimate businesses, making hard working and honest people look indolent.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat about the effect of drug trafficking on the moral fabric of the society. This society rarely questions the source or sources of people\u2019s wealth. That\u2019s why drug traffickers end up becoming role models in the society, with devastating consequences for our young ones.<\/p> <p>\u201cEven governance is not spared. Drug traffickers and money launderers contest and win elections into high offices, where they help shape policy. Just imagine the damage this can do to governance and indeed to any nation.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is why I want to once again commend Gen. Marwa for raising the bar in the fight against drug cartels and the use of illicit drugs with the new maxim, \u2018offensive action\u2019.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Information and Culture will work with you to give maximum publicity to your activities, especially in the area of advocacy. To date, we have launched a number of national campaigns. It will not be a bad idea for the Ministry, working with the NDLEA, to launch a national campaign against drug trafficking and use of illicit drugs.<\/p> <p>\u201cI will also encourage the NDLEA to work with the National Orientation Agency (NOA), which has set up Integrity Clubs in Secondary Schools nationwide, to reach the young ones with its campaign against drug use,\u201d he said.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"34KYK9TV2TNXGKATPY3UFERH6I3SB6"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":321,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2021","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"drug abuse, trafficker, Nigeria","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2021","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"drug abuse, trafficker, Nigeria","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1022423841,"Input.title":"Emma Watson is right","Input.publish_date":"2022-01-09 03:30:27","Input.article_interface":"<p>Emma Watson is right<\/p> <p>Read on for article<\/p> <p>\u201cFree Palestine!\u201d says actress Emma Watson.

Hamas recently arrested seven citizens for \u201cparticipating in a video chat where they answered questions from Israeli civilians about life in Gaza.\u201d And other Gazans were jailed for \u201cweakening the revolutionary spirit.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hamas also frequently executes citizens after \u201ctrials\u201d that are \u201cmarred with due process violations,\u201d reports Human Rights Watch.<\/p> <p>How do the P.A. and Hamas regimes treat those whom it arrests? \u201cPalestinian security forces in the West Bank and Gaza routinely used torture and other ill-treatment with impunity. \u2026 Security forces in both areas used unnecessary and\/or excessive force during law enforcement activities.\u201d<\/p> <p>What about women\u2019s rights in Occupied Palestine? Amnesty: \u201cWomen and girls faced discrimination in law and practice and were inadequately protected against sexual and other gender-based violence, including so-called honour killings.\u201d Last year alone, \u201cnineteen women died in the West Bank and 18 in Gaza as a result of gender-based violence.\u201d<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch points out that the P.A. \u201chas no comprehensive domestic violence law.\u201d Keep in mind that the P.A. has been ruling for 27 years. Nearly three decades in power and still no comprehensive domestic violence law.<\/p> <p>With regard to gay rights, Amnesty reports: \u201cLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people continued to face discrimination and lacked protection\u201d at the hands of Hamas and the P.A. In Gaza, section 152 of the penal code \u201ccriminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity and makes it punishable by up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d<\/p> <p>Citing local Palestinian Arab human-rights activists, Amnesty says that in the past year, there were numerous \u201cviolations of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press,\u201d as well as \u201c158 cases in the West Bank and 118 in Gaza of the arbitrary arrests of opponents and critics.\u201d<\/p> <p>Amnesty says that last year, the Palestinian Centre for Development and Media Freedoms \u201crecorded 97 incidents of attacks against journalists, including arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment during interrogation, confiscation of equipment, physical assaults and bans on reporting: 36 in the West Bank and 61 in Gaza.\u201d<\/p> <p>As for elections, the P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas is now in the 17th year of his four year-term and has repeatedly postponed parliamentary elections. In Gaza, too, democracy is a dirty word.<\/p> <p>I realize that Emma Watson is an actress, not an expert on Middle East affairs. And in posting about \u201cPalestine,\u201d she might have just been going along with what she thinks all the cool young celebrities are doing.<\/p> <p>But perhaps the international uproar that she has provoked will inspire her to take a closer look at the implications of what she posted on Instagram.

In the United States, they paid homage to her legacy with a place in the Hispanic Journalism Hall of Fame.<\/p> <p>By Ivette Munguia (Confidencial)<\/p> <p>HAVANA TIMES \u2013 Nicaraguan Ana Real paid for three dinners in Manhattan in order to obtain the interview that television anchor Dan Rather held with then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Although she\u2019d been promised an interview while in Cuba, that promise wasn\u2019t enough to convince this television producer, who would have to transfer the crew and equipment from the United States to Iraq. In the end, though, despite the fact that television channels all over the world were fighting to get an interview, she was the only one to achieve this for CBS.<\/p> <p>Ana was 60 years old when she died last March 27. She had been with CBS since 2001, most currently as the foreign news producer for CBS News. She was always true to her convictions and, as her husband Miguel Real recalls: \u201cShe did things because she wanted to do them; she didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval.\u201d He adds that things in the US culture don\u2019t usually work like that, but \u201cit worked for her\u201d.<\/p> <p>Interviewing Hussein was a main aspiration for all of the most powerful television channels in the world during 2003. Ana glimpsed the possibility of landing such an interview when she travelled to Cuba with her CBS News team to interview Fidel Castro. On that occasion, the Cuban regime disappointed her seconds before the interview, after having promised them an exclusive. She was furious, and yelled at them \u2013 \u201cHypocrites! You\u2019re all full of crap.\u201d Everyone there was horrified, until Castro\u2019s lawyer approached her.<\/p> <p>\u201cAna, take it easy. If I could give you something, what would you ask for?\u201d he asked her.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf I could ask you for anything, I\u2019d like an interview with Saddam Hussein,\u201d she responded.<\/p> <p>When Ana returned from Cuba, she pitched the idea of the interview with Hussein to CBS News, but no one believed it would be possible. There was about a one percent chance of obtaining what many considered impossible, but she was convinced that they had nothing to lose, and if they did get the interview, they had a lot to gain.<\/p> <p>Ana had a broad network of contacts around the world, which she had gathered through the work she did. Those contacts and her skill at \u201casking and landing things\u201d were the levers she used in a Manhattan restaurant to \u201cobtain\u2026the interview with Saddam Hussein, at a time when there were thousands of international media outlets seeking such an interview,\u201d explains Miguel.<\/p> <p>He also attributes to her the incomparable coverage CBS provided on the arrest of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, head of the Mexican cartel. She also produced in-depth stories about the survivors of the earthquake in Haiti, and about the questionable practices of the international adoption agencies, reports that won her two Emmy\u2019s.<\/p> <p>Her first steps<\/p> <p>Before her successful career as a television producer in the U.S., Ana and her husband Miguel spent time in a number of countries in Latin America, covering stories and reporting on major events for international agencies. They informed about wars, natural disasters, and on two occasions they had to flee authoritarian regimes who were unhappy with the investigative work that Miguel did.<\/p> <p>Ana began in the world pf journalism without having planned to do so. In 1984, as a recent graduate in Hotel Administration her vision was aimed more at working in tourism and the service industry.<\/p> <p>She returned to Nicaragua after studying in the United States and found work at the Intercontinental Hotel, the largest and most prestigious of the era. However, the war brought the arrival of dozens of journalists and international agencies, who installed themselves in the Managua hotel. This tied her to the call to tell the stories, and she never looked back.<\/p> <p>\u201cI helped them with contacts and logistics. Suddenly, I found myself involved more with journalism than with the hotel business, and I began as a \u201cfreelance producer\u201d, Ana recalled during a 2015 interview with Confidencial.<\/p> <p>Among the reporters that were covering the war in Nicaragua was Mexican Miguel Real. He and Ana met in a bar that was right next door to the hotel where she was working. They became good friends, and he invited her to Guatemala. She had been planning to get married, but Miguel persuaded her to accompany him for a week. While they were in Guatemala, Miguel was dispatched to Mexico to cover the 1985 earthquake there. Ana went with him. \u201cThat\u2019s when she really began her career, when she discovered a taste for journalism,\u201d Miguel recalls.<\/p> <p>Ana\u2019s wedding was cancelled, and she began her relationship with Miguel. \u201cWe went to live in El Salvador,\u201d recounts her widower. At the end of the decade of the 80s, Ana was working as a freelancer for the international news channels that came to cover the war in El Salvador.<\/p> <p>She later traveled to Venezuela, Columbia, all over Central America, and the Caribbean, among other countries. During the nineties, the family settled in Peru, but they were later expelled by the regime of Alberto Fujimori due to Miguel\u2019s investigative work.<\/p> <p>After their abrupt departure from Peru, Ana, together with her spouse and children, moved to the United States. There she worked first for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Later, in 2001, she joined CBS, the Columbia Broadcasting System.<\/p> <p>She was passionate about her work. She would answer the telephone 24 hours a day, even though this habit caused some marital discussions. For her, the production was \u201cthe heart of the story,\u201d as she told Confidencial magazine in 2015.<\/p> <p>She touched the life of many people<\/p> <p>Ana\u2019s passion for journalism went beyond her work. She became a mentor for many people; she led teams of reporters all over the world; and she was president of the local chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in New York City, advising young journalism students.<\/p> <p>\u201cShe helped them present themselves, not to diminish themselves in front of the US industry people. She\u2019d tell them that they had to be themselves, that we have worth as Latinos,\u201d Miguel remembers.<\/p> <p>In a posthumous homage held at the beginning of September, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists hung the name of Ana Real in the Hispanic Journalists\u2019 Hall of Fame, a distinction that has also been received by journalists such as Rosental Alves, founder and director of the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, and Maria Elena Salinas.<\/p> <p>In the same event, Ingrid Ciprian-Mathews, executive vice president of professional strategic development for CBS News, emphasized: \u201cUndoubtedly, Ana was special. She had distinctive qualities that made her unforgettable to her many friends, colleagues, apprentices, and acquaintances all over the world.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThrough her charm, curiosity and ingenuity, she always got the story. And through her disarming sense of identification with other people, she faced up to all the challenges, because her objective was the story. This scholarship will continue her legacy and inspire the next generation of journalists,\u201d Ciprian-Matthews continued.<\/p> <p>Alberto B. Mendoza, executive director of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists emphasized: \u201cAna was an incredibly talented journalist who always saw the best in the students and really believed in them and in their success within the field. Those who had the opportunity to know her were anxious to learn from her, and the students who receive this scholarship will have the honor of following in the steps of one of the most influential leaders of journalism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Another way of honoring Ana Real\u2019s legacy was by creating a scholarship fund for journalism students in the United States. The first two scholarships will be awarded starting in 2020, and the winners will receive $5,000 to be used for tuition, lodging, food and books.<\/p> <p>Nicaraguan journalist Tifani Roberts feels that Ana \u201creached the top\u201d. She never went on the air herself, but, as Roberts noted: \u201cshe had a lot of influence behind the scenes: What would be covered? How would it be covered?\u201d<\/p> <p>During the outbreak of the civic rebellion in Nicaragua, \u201cAna Clemencia pushed and pushed. CBS became the only one of the US broadcast networks to send their foreign news teams to Nicaragua to cover the crisis. That was thanks to her,\u201d Roberts states.<\/p> <p>She adds that the last time she saw Ana, she was there with her team from CBS News conducting interviews outside of El Chipote, an infamous jail in Nicaragua, where many of the protesters were held and tortured.<\/p> <p>Her husband, Miguel Real, also believes that \u201cAna\u2019s frustrated dream\u201d was to see the fall of Daniel Ortega\u2019s regime, but she didn\u2019t live long enough.<\/p> <p>Unique, determined, proactive, generous<\/p> <p>Long before becoming a successful news producer, traveling the world and molding dozens of journalists, Ana Clemencia Padilla (her maiden name) was a young girl from the middle classes who enjoyed interacting with the tourists that passed through the port town of Corinito, the most important port in Nicaragua during the era of cotton growing. That\u2019s where she spent her early years, due to the work of her father, Jose Padilla Ramirez, who was at that time a well-known physician.<\/p> <p>Born in Managua on September 24, 1958, she was the youngest of four children from the marriage of Dr. Jose Padilla and Rafaela Lopez de Padilla. Sometime later, the family moved to Corinto. She had a happy childhood, and \u201cwas a generous person,\u201d recalls her sister Patricia Padilla.<\/p> <p>Ana Patricia\u2019s voice breaks when she remembers Ana. She pauses and later says: \u201c[She was] my soul sister. We were best friends, we loved each other so much, we were close.\u201d<\/p> <p>When Ana and her brothers and sisters were teenagers, the family returned to Managua. She was about to graduate from high school when her school collapsed during the earthquake that destroyed Managua in 1972. She finished high school in an improvised classroom.<\/p> <p>In the mid-seventies, the revolutionary movement against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza gained strength, and Ana\u2019s parents decided to send her to the United States to avoid her getting involved. In that country she lived with different families, learned English, and later was able to study tourism.<\/p> <p>While Ana and Miguel were traveling the world and reporting on the most important events, they also had two children, Ana Carolina and Miguel. \u201cWe were a different kind of parents,\u201d Miguel recalls, explaining that his children grew up amid wars and natural disasters, until the family finally decided to put down roots in the United States.<\/p> <p>Optimistic until the end<\/p> <p>On March 27, 2019, five months after she was diagnosed with leukemia, Ana Real passed away. She was 60. The illness surprised her during a vacation trip to Mexico, but she was convinced that she\u2019d beat the cancer. However, her body couldn\u2019t resist the bone marrow transplant, and she died from multiple organ failure.<\/p> <p>Ana\u2019s leukemia was \u201ca scientific case study,\u201d Miguel explains. Her type of leukemia is little known since her bone marrow was apparently clear of cancerous cells, but in some way or another they were producing the disease. That\u2019s why she decided to submit to a bone marrow transplant that her body in the end couldn\u2019t hold up under.<\/p> <p>\u201cReally, until minutes before her death, we were certain that everything was going to come out well,\u201d recounts Miguel. The strength that Ana transmitted to her loved ones made them think that everything would be alright.<\/p> <p>Her sister Patricia says: \u201cAna was so generous that she never told us the seriousness of her illness, although she knew it.

More than 35,000 people have been arrested, thousands have been tortured or abused, and 400 political prisoners are currently behind bars. Earlier this week a 50-year-old opposition activist, Vitold Ashurok, died in a penal colony. The official cause of death was \u201cheart attack\u201d. His widow believes he was murdered.<\/p> <p>It is against this dark and repressive backdrop that the extraordinary events of Sunday took place. According to state media, Lukashenko personally authorised the forced downing of a Ryanair plane as it flew over Belarusian airspace between Greece and Lithuania \u2013 a real-time hijacking. He even dispatched a MIG-29 fighter jet to ensure the pilot complied after being informed of a fake bomb threat.<\/p> <p>The target of Lukashenko\u2019s fury was a 26-year-old passenger and opposition blogger, Roman Protasevich. Protasevich is the co-founder of Nexta, a Telegram channel. Since last August\u2019s presidential election, widely seen as rigged, it has reported on, and coordinated demonstrations against, the Belarus regime. These continue. Like other critics he had left Belarus for exile. And what he must have thought was the safety of the EU.<\/p> <p>Protasevich was arrested when his plane landed in Minsk. His Russian girlfriend who was with him, Sofia Sapega, was detained too. Their whereabouts are unknown. The shocking incident has provoked widespread international condemnation and horror. On Monday Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, called it \u201cair piracy\u201d. Foreign ministers have dubbed it in-flight kidnapping, blatant \u201cstate terrorism\u201d and sheer thuggery.<\/p> <p>The dilemma for western governments is how to respond. According to Andrei Sannikov, a former Belarus presidential candidate imprisoned in 2010, the regime is not merely enacting the worst domestic crackdown in Belarus since its independence from the Soviet Union \u2013 beating up its own, as he put it. It poses a grave threat to other countries, he said. Most of the passengers on board \u2013 171 of them \u2013 were EU citizens.<\/p> <p>Sannikov described Lukashenko\u2019s embattled Moscow-backed government as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d. \u201cYes, Lukashenko is a psychopath, a dangerous one,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThis is a test for the international community in general. The west has yet to find instruments and tools to deal with him. Maybe the hijacking will trigger something. These are not empty threats. Not even North Korea would do something like this.\u201d<\/p> <p>The hijacking raises the nightmarish prospect that Lukashenko may now carry out other special operations against critics living abroad. The head of Belarus\u2019s KGB, Ivan Tsertsel, has promised to eliminate all \u201ctraitors to the motherland\u201d. In April his colleague Gen Nikolai Karpenkov, head of internal forces, said participants in peaceful rallies would face \u201cinevitable retribution\u201d and be \u201ctreated as terrorists\u201d. State TV has talked of Stalin-style killings.<\/p> <p>Just a few hours before his plane was forcibly landed, Protasevich reported he was under surveillance at Athens airport. A Russian-speaking man dressed in a T-shirt and chinos stood behind him during boarding and tried to take photos of his ID, he said. At Minsk four passengers slipped off the plane and disappeared. They appear to be intelligence officers working for Belarus\u2019s KGB. At least two reportedly had Russian passports.<\/p> <p>02:00 Belarus seizes blogger after 'hijacking' Ryanair flight \u2013 video report<\/p> <p>If Russia had a role in the hijacking is unclear. Its FSB spy agency recently helped to arrest an opposition activist in Moscow accused of plotting a \u201ccoup\u201d against Lukashenko and Russian state media has praised Belarus\u2019s president for his \u201cbeautiful\u201d and uncompromising move. The incident, some believe, will further estrange Belarus from Europe, to the Kremlin\u2019s advantage.<\/p> <p>Already it has having a chilling effect on other dissidents. Natalia Kaliada, co-founder of the Belarus Free Theatre, was due to meet Protasevich this week. She told the Guardian she spoke with the pilot and airline on Sunday after boarding a flight from London to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. \u201cThe plane was put on alert. It avoided Belarus airspace. I\u2019ve had multiple death threats since November and December,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>In recent months the mass protests against Lukashenko have diminished. According to Sannikov, however, the regime is weaker than it seems, with Lukashenko reliant on his security forces. Behind the scenes there are defections and suicides, he said. \u201cLukashenko doesn\u2019t control the state anymore or the economy or government. He\u2019s only meeting with the men in uniform,\u201d he added. \u201cThe protests may be less. But hatred of Lukashenko personally is growing. It\u2019s leading to an explosion.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to Nigel Gould-Davies, Britain\u2019s former ambassador in Minsk, the EU and UK should consult with the Belarus opposition co-ordinating committee before deciding on possible sanctions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t only about Belarus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Belarus gets away with it other countries will likely be emboldened to have a malign interest in getting hold of people who have fled abroad.\u201d Sunday\u2019s events showed Lukashenko\u2019s weakness, he pointed out, noting: \u201cHe can\u2019t regain legitimacy.\u201d<\/p> <p>For Belarus\u2019s embattled journalistic community, meanwhile, it has been a disastrous period. The country\u2019s biggest non-state media outlet \u2013 the website tut.by \u2013 was shut down last week, with many of its staff rounded up and arrested. Currently 30 journalists are in prison. They now include Protasevich, who faces charges of organising mass riots and organising group activities which \u201cviolate public order\u201d. It is enough to see him jailed for years.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3EAWOID6MVCCOPONLDBA6KF5EI0V0S"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":519,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","kidnapping","killing"],"year":"2021","month":"May","date":null,"city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vitold Ashurok","victim_keywords":"Belarus, political prisoner, penal colony, heart attack","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roman Protasevich","victim_keywords":"blogger, activist, Ryanair, diverted flight","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sofia Sapega","victim_keywords":"Roman Protasevich girlfriend, detained","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","kidnapping","killing"],"year":"2021","month":"May","date":null,"city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vitold Ashurok","victim_keywords":"Belarus, political prisoner, penal colony, heart attack","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Roman Protasevich","victim_keywords":"blogger, activist, Ryanair, diverted flight","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sofia Sapega","victim_keywords":"Roman Protasevich girlfriend, detained","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":970184434,"Input.title":"Gunmen kidnap dozens from school in central Nigeria","Input.publish_date":"2021-02-17 14:43:02","Input.article_interface":"<p>Gunmen from a suspected criminal gang stormed a school in central Nigeria on Wednesday, killing one student and kidnapping dozens of other pupils, teachers and relatives, the local government said, in the country\u2019s latest mass abduction.<\/p> <p>President Muhammadu Buhari ordered security forces to coordinate a rescue operation, his office said, after gunmen in military uniforms raided the Government Science College in the town of Kagara in Niger state.<\/p> <p>Details about the kidnapping were still emerging and a new tally came after initial reports from a government official and a security source that hundreds of students were snatched from the school, where they were staying in dormitories.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey kidnapped 42 people from the school.

to make a EU-Vietnam trade deal work","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-07 11:12:01","Input.article_interface":"<p>The jury is out on whether a new EU-Vietnam trade pact will do anything to improve people\u2019s livelihoods and arrest a deteriorating human rights record, writes Jude Kirton-Darling.<\/p> <p>Jude Kirton-Darling is a British MEP in the Socialists and Democrats group (S&D).<\/p> <p>Last week we learned that all the 39 people tragically found dead in a lorry in Essex were Vietnamese. The news reached me in Hanoi, where I was taking part in a European Parliament trade delegation. While MEPs are currently considering whether or not to support new comprehensive trade and investment deals with Vietnam, this horrendous story has shone a sombre light on the complex reality of our relationship with the world\u2019s 15th biggest country. A complexity based on increasing flows of investment, goods and services taking place above the table, a deteriorating human rights environment according to Amnesty and others, and human trafficking hidden within plain sight.<\/p> <p>The question before us, as MEPs set to vote on this deal in January next year, must therefore be: will this trade deal help improve people\u2019s livelihoods and rights, and offer a brighter future for Vietnamese at home? Or will it make matters worse?<\/p> <p>After an intensive and high-level trade delegation, including meetings with government, civil society, business and international organisations, I don\u2019t have a definite answer yet. Ultimately, much depends on how the Vietnamese authorities respond in action to our concerns. In the months leading up to the ratification vote in the European Parliament, they can commit Vietnam to a path of progress, which the EU will support through renewed economic and diplomatic relations. But if they choose to ignore our concerns on fundamental freedoms, human rights and sustainable development, then I struggle to see how MEPs could endorse the deals.<\/p> <p>Central to this progressive agenda are labour rights in the country. Vietnam is producing more and more for the EU market \u2013 primarily telephone sets, electronic products, footwear, textiles and clothing \u2013 with imports from the country having nearly quadrupled over the past ten years. This makes labour rights in the country all the more important for EU consumers. While it is clearly not satisfactory today, the situation in this respect could soon change for the better with the right political leadership in Vietnam.<\/p> <p>There are currently no independent trade unions in this one-party state, but a revision of the Labour Code currently being debated by the National Assembly could grant workers the right to form their own grassroots organisations, hence enacting in Vietnamese law at least in the principle of ILO convention 87. The vote on the reform by the Vietnamese National Assembly, expected later this month, could also give workers new protections such as rules to prevent companies from abusing temporary contracts. Vietnam has already given us some tangible signs of its willingness to improve the situation in this respect. ILO Convention 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining was ratified by Vietnam in July this year and will enter into force in July 2020. Whether the Labour Code reform is adopted, and crucially whether subsequent implementing legislation confirms this progressive workers\u2019 rights agenda will be key for EU parliamentarians in assessing the trade deal this winter. We will also be looking closely at whether Vietnam produces a credible roadmap towards the full ratification of ILO Convention 105 on the abolition of forced labour and ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association by 2020 and 2023, respectively.<\/p> <p>But as many organisations such as Human Rights Watch have pointed out, labour rights are not the whole story: human rights more broadly are at stake in these trade negotiations, and a positive vote from the EP should only come as a result of progress for fundamental freedoms overall. In this respect the situation is very concerning. According to several sources, there are currently over a hundred political prisoners in the country, and the number is rising. While the European Parliament delegation was in Hanoi, two online activists were sentenced to prison terms for sharing content on social media, or according to Vietnam\u2019s penal code \u201cconducting anti-state propaganda\u201d and \u201cabusing democratic freedom\u201d. The rights to free expression, association and assembly are severely curtailed. The judiciary, the press and civil society are under tight government control. Over recent years, the European Parliament has adopted several resolutions condemning Vietnam for its human rights record, and demanded concrete changes. The response from Vietnamese authorities have been unsatisfactory thus far. The most recent European Parliament resolution, in November 2018, notably called for the release of all political prisoners. Since then, only one of them was freed \u2013 but only because he had completed his prison term. The resolution also called for putting an end to the harassment of human rights defenders, lifting restrictions on religious freedom, ensuring the humane treatment for all detainees, ensuring fair trials, adopting a revision of the Penal Code and enacting a moratorium on the death penalty.<\/p> <p>One recent piece of legislation has attracted specific criticism: a new cyber security law that entered into force at the start of 2019. Actors on the ground have documented an intensified crackdown on human rights activism in the country, linked to the provisions of the new law that give the authorities licence to censor content, control information and silence online dissidents. The legislation also raises concerns for EU economic interests, including forced data localisation provisions which are at odds with the EU\u2019s liberalisation agenda in this respect. This law must be revised to be brought in line with international standards.<\/p> <p>Greater trade between the EU and Vietnam could be beneficial to people on both sides, creating jobs and lowering costs, but only if it underpins fundamental rights and better working conditions. Before we vote in the European Parliament, we need a strong signal from Vietnam that this trade deal will deliver on its sustainable development promises. This implies concrete action on labour rights, human rights and the cyber-security law. This was the message that was audible and I hope was heard in Hanoi during our visit.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3DQYSJDTYNQ3J48CTZB7FUEUOUIXEJ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"cfe772f1-9e88-4332-850f-791cd09c3fd2","work_time_in_seconds":837,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2019","month":"11","date":"7.0","city":"None","region":"Essex","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Vietnamese, 39 people, lorry, dead","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2019","month":"11","date":"7.0","city":"None","region":"Essex","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Vietnamese, 39 people, lorry, dead","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":971781093,"Input.title":"From Chibok To Jangebe: A Timeline Of School Kidnappings In Nigeria \u2013 Channels Television","Input.publish_date":"2021-02-26 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Suspected gunmen on Friday morning attacked a school in Zamfara State, abducting scores of students in the third mass abduction in the past three months in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.<\/p> <p>The attackers stormed the Government Girls Secondary School in Jangebe in the wee hours of the day.<\/p> <p>Hours later, the police authorities in the northwestern state confirmed that three hundred and seventeen students (317) were abducted in the latest kidnapping, a development which Amnesty International described as an \u201cattack on education in Northern Nigeria.\u201d<\/p> <p>Friday\u2019s attack by assailants is not an isolated case.

Dissident journalists, including Blumenthal, stationed themselves in the embassy in opposition to the illegal eviction and to document the behavior of the evictors. Blumenthal calls the assault charge \u201ca 100 percent false, fabricated, bogus, untrue, and malicious lie.\u201d<\/p> <p>I watched the news of the embassy standoff with much interest, largely because the obnoxious, oafish behavior of the anti-Maduro counter-protesters on the scene were a perfect reflection of the obnoxious, oafish behavior I\u2019d experienced from anti-Maduro accounts online. I\u2019ve argued with every major political faction in America at one point or another, and some of them can be downright vile, but I\u2019ve never run into such an intellectually dishonest, crude, nasty group of people in my three years on this job as those who\u2019ve been cheering on the Trump administration\u2019s regime change agenda in Venezuela. There\u2019s not a doubt in my mind that someone from this unscrupulous, shady group would be capable of making false allegations against a dissident journalist who disagreed with them.<\/p> <p>\u201cAccording to an individual familiar with the case, the warrant for Blumenthal\u2019s arrest was initially rejected,\u201d Grayzone reports. \u201cStrangely, this false charge was revived months later without the defendant\u2019s knowledge.\u201d<\/p> <p>Strangely indeed.<\/p> <p>I was arrested on Friday on a COMPLETELY FALSE charge manufactured by the Venezuelan opposition related to their siege of the embassy in DC. I spent 2 days in jail, was shackled for extended periods & was denied my right to call a lawyer. Here\u2019s the facts: https:\/\/t.co\/2Nco0OzQ7P<\/p> <p>\u2014 Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) October 28, 2019<\/p> <p>Strange as it is, alternative media figures are the only people talking about an opposition journalist being arrested on highly suspicious grounds in a highly suspicious way. Mainstream media reporters have been completely ignoring this story.<\/p> <p>\u201cArrest and caging of opposition US journalist Max Blumenthal reminds me (and others I know) of the worst of Russia,\u201d tweeted journalist Mark Ames. \u201cExcept there, when oppo journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested, most big-name Russian journalists\u2014including Putin-friendly\u2014publicly supported Golunov. Here\u2014silence.\u201d<\/p> <p>This silence is unsurprising at this point, because this same media class has for years been either mute or vocally favorable on the persecution of another dissident journalist, Julian Assange. Ambitious young journalists are made well aware that the very easiest way to demonstrate your loyalty to the media-owning plutocratic establishment is to participate in the relentless smear campaign against the WikiLeaks founder which has worked its way into virtually all political sectors of the western world, and the very easiest way to lose standing within the plutocratic media is to defend him.<\/p> <p>There\u2019s a popular quote that a German pastor wrote after the second World War that goes,<\/p> <p>\u201cFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was not a socialist.<\/p> <p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was not a trade unionist.<\/p> <p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was not a Jew.<\/p> <p>Then they came for me\u2014<\/p> <p>and there was no one left to speak for me.\u201d<\/p> <p>It\u2019s a good quote, and, understandably, people have been invoking it for the steadily escalating war on oppositional journalism we\u2019ve been witnessing throughout the western empire. Cries of \u201cFirst they came for Assange\u201d and \u201cFirst they came for the journalists\u201d are common in circles which value the existence of a free press which is capable of holding power to account, the argument being that if you let them come for journalists like Assange and Blumenthal, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they come for you, too.<\/p> <p>Only one problem: it isn\u2019t true.<\/p> <p>Arrest & caging of opposition US journalist @MaxBlumenthal reminds me (and others I know) of the worst of Russia. Except there, when oppo journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested, most big-name Russian journalists\u2014including Putin-friendly\u2014publicly supported Golunov.<\/p> <p>Here\u2014silence.<\/p> <p>\u2014 Mark Ames (@MarkAmesExiled) October 29, 2019<\/p> <p>It isn\u2019t true that if you allow authority to come after dissident journalists they\u2019ll necessarily end up coming after you. That\u2019s only true if you intend at some point to publish something that those in power don\u2019t want you to publish. If you\u2019ve closed the door to the possibility of your ever doing that, then you know that there is no risk to you, so there\u2019s no need to defend dissident journalists when their reporting sees them targeted for legal persecution by the powerful. Which is exactly what mainstream reporters who fail to defend Assange and Blumenthal are telling us about themselves: they\u2019ve closed that door and chosen the side of power, come what may.<\/p> <p>This is where the silence comes from. It isn\u2019t that those who work in mainstream news media lack an understanding that at some point power structures may shift and you\u2019ll want to report facts that are inconvenient for the powerful without fear of imprisonment; these people all watched Donald Trump get elected. They already know that things can take a very dark turn in the future for where power is located, and they\u2019ve already decided they don\u2019t care and will always side with the powerful going forward. If the election of Donald Trump wasn\u2019t enough to show these people that it\u2019s a good idea to make sure the press can continue to hold power to account in the future, then nothing will. They\u2019re not ignorant, they\u2019re subservient. They\u2019ve made a lifelong commitment to continue to worship at the altar of power.<\/p> <p>If we were to re-write the \u201cFirst they came\u201d poem to describe the current war on dissident journalism we\u2019re seeing in 2019, it would go more like this:<\/p> <p>First they came for Assange, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was a mainstream western journalist with no intention of ever usetting the powerful.<\/p> <p>Then they came for Blumental, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was a mainstream western journalist with no intention of ever usetting the powerful.<\/p> <p>Then they came for all the other dissident journalists, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I will never be a dissident journalist.<\/p> <p>They never came for me\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I have chosen to serve power.<\/p> <p>______________________________<\/p> <p>Thanks for reading!

Still, we embrace this job with great good humor or, when required, grim resolve.<\/p> <p>For the complete listing, see our frequently updated archives.<\/p> <p>Rabab Abdulhadi (left) praised Palestinian hijacker Leila Khaled as \"somebody who actually stands up for herself, speaks for herself, actually goes to a plane and hijacks it.\"<\/p> <p>The selections below were chosen on their individual merits, so to speak. Some are blatantly vile, others unintentionally comical, but all illustrate the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of Middle East studies in North America. Each speaker should recoil in shame when confronted with his own words, but we aren't so na\u00efve as to expect it.<\/p> <p>Wading through the archives was rather like reading Dante's Inferno or C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters, but with an obvious difference of authorial intent. Whereas the poet and the apologist seek to persuade their readers to pursue virtue by illustrating vice, our professors spew vice while masquerading as purveyors of virtue.<\/p> <p>Below we expose some of their most infamous statements \u2013 and have a little fun while we're at it. The winners follow, with brief commentary, in chronological order:<\/p> <p>1. \"We really idolize somebody like Leila Khaled, somebody who actually stands up for herself, speaks for herself, actually goes to a plane and hijacks it.\" Rabab Abdulhadi, professor in Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas\/Race and Resistance Studies at San Francisco State University. Goldengate Express, September 22, 2020.<\/p> <p>Who doesn't get misty-eyed recalling the grand old days of Palestinian airline hijackings? What better way to preserve that glorious legacy than teaching students to idolize the Queen of Terror at 30,000 Feet, Leila Khaled? Back in 1970, Khaled helped hijack an El Al flight but failed to blow it up when her grenade didn't explode. A role model for the ages.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Brown: \"I don't think it's morally evil to own somebody.\"<\/p> <p>2. \"I don't think you can talk about slavery in Islam until you realize that there is no such thing as slavery. . . . Slavery cannot just be treated as a moral evil in and of itself. I don't think it's morally evil to own somebody because we own lots of people all around us. And we're owned by people.\" Jonathan Brown, Alwaleed bin Talal Chair of Islamic Civilization at Georgetown University. From a lecture at the Islamist-run International Institute of Islamic Thought, in IPT News, February 13, 2017.<\/p> <p>Most of us yokels, when asked our opinion on slavery, would condemn it in the strongest possible terms. But most of us don't shoulder the heavy burdens of Jonathan Brown, who lives the double life of university professor and Islamist. How to speak publicly on slavery in Islam, then, while fulfilling dueling identities? Try to muddy the waters so that decent people aren't appalled, but slavery-supporting Islamists won't think you're a sell-out. But Brown blew it by failing to grasp that contemporary slavery isn't a terribly ambiguous issue for normal people. This episode tells us all we need to know about both Brown's common decency and his common sense.<\/p> <p>3. \"Compared to the scale of death and destruction that the U.S. has unleashed on major cities in Afghanistan and Iraq, and later Bashar al-Assad and his nemesis have visited upon Syria, the destruction of those two [World Trade Center] towers now appears as entirely negligible, even remembering them perhaps an insult to the memories of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings maimed and murdered and turned into hopeless refugees in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya or Syria.\" Hamid Dabashi, Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. Published in Al-Jazeera on the fifteenth anniversary of 9\/11, September 11, 2016.<\/p> <p>Hamid Dabashi would be cringe-worthy as a second-rate literary villain. As a chaired professor, he's testimony to academe's moral and intellectual depravity. Unabashedly anti-Semitic, spiteful toward his adopted country, less a revolutionary than shallow narcissist, Dabashi's writings insult the memories of those slaughtered on 9\/11.<\/p> <p>4. \"Israeli complaints that Gaza is controlled by the party-militia, Hamas, freely elected in 2006, and that Hamas fires (mostly small, home-made and ineffectual) rockets into Israel, are irrelevant to the requirement that civilian noncombatants in Gaza be provided with basic staples by the occupying authority.\" Juan Cole, Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan, in the Nation, February 3, 2016.<\/p> <p>You have to have a soft spot in your heart for those upstanding Hamas terrorists. Here they are minding their own business, just trying to kill and terrorize as many Jews as possible by raining thousands of rockets down on civilian populations. But those damned little rockets! Why, they're hardly bigger than roman candles, and it seems no matter how many they launch, they never kill all the Israelis! Thank goodness for truthtellers like Juan Cole!<\/p> <p>Joseph Massad makes the list with a 114-word sentence inscrutable to any sane homo sapien.<\/p> <p>5. \"The imperial complicity of the Gay International, including its Arab members, lies in their calling upon all Arabs who refuse the imperial hegemony of the hetero-homo binary to unlearn and unthink the way they desire, and that they learn and think their desires along the lines of the hetero-homo binary, indeed that the way they exist and the way they are, their very ontology, is a form of false consciousness, which they must shed, as the truth of who they are, according to this logic, lies in their adoption of the imperial hetero-homo binary through which they must apprehend themselves and their desires, which will lead, according to the Gay International, to their emancipation.\" Joseph Massad, associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University. From an interview in Jadaliyya, March 5, 2013.<\/p> <p>We don't know what the hell this means, but Massad seems to decry \"the hetero-homo binary\" as hegemonic, especially in its imperial form, and believes that emancipation requires this very ontology. Or something.<\/p> <p>Juan Cole's fecund imagination runs from \"giant James Bond villains\" to Newt Gingrich with whips and chains.<\/p> <p>6. \"It wasn't the 21-year-old Michael Enright who drunkenly slashed his New York city cab driver after asking 'Are you Muslim?' It was the Republican National Committee. . . . Newt Gingrich and Rick Lazio may as well have kept Enright in their basements in chains and whipped him into a frenzy as to spew their hatred on the airwaves.\" Juan Cole, Richard P. Mitchell Professor of History at the University of Michigan. At his blog Informed Comment, August 25, 2010.<\/p> <p>Most folks would settle for alien abductions, but back in 2010 Cole couldn't shake imagining violent kidnappings. We're not a shrink, so we won't speculate why, but that March he wrote that being a Middle East expert who is ignored in the public arena is like being an MLB player ready for the World Series who's \"kidnapped,\" taken to a \"secret fight club,\" and made to face a \"giant James Bond villain.\" By August, he was fantasizing that Newt and Lazio were into whips and chains. Projection or the heat of summer? You judge.<\/p> <p>7. \"If Jews can get reparations from Germany, then Palestinians should get reparations from Israel. After all, what the Germans supposedly did to the Jews is what Israel is doing to the people of Palestine.\" Susan Slyomovics, professor of anthropology and former director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies (CNES) at UCLA. Spoken during a break at a UCLA conference, via FrontPage Magazine, April 16, 2010.<\/p> <p>Such a sly Susan! We don't mean her pedestrian analogy that Israelis = Nazis, Palestinians = Holocaust victims. Yawn. Every self-respecting Israel hater knows that. But see how she surreptitiously sneaks in \"supposedly\" just when you didn't expect it? It's a two-fer: casting doubt on the veracity of the Holocaust while smearing Jews as the new Nazis. It's a calculated convolution!<\/p> <p>Ebrahim Moosa: \"Wahabism is like the Baptists.\"<\/p> <p>8. \"Wahabism is like the Baptists; it's kind of a denomination of sorts that started out in Saudi Arabia.\" Ebrahim Moosa, then at Duke University, now Mirza Family Professor of Islamic Thought & Muslim Societies at the University of Note Dame. As reported in the Charlotte Observer, February 25, 2010.<\/p> <p>The rank disingenuousness of Moosa's claim is seen in a quote from the great historian Bernard Lewis. In illustrating the power that Wahhabi Islam gained during the twentieth century, Lewis said: \"Imagine that the Ku Klux Klan gets total control of the state of Texas. And the Ku Klux Klan has at its disposal all the oil rigs in Texas. And they use this money to set up a well-endowed network of colleges and schools throughout Christendom, peddling their peculiar brand of Christianity. You would then have an approximate equivalent of what has happened in the modern Muslim world.\"<\/p> <p>9. \"I do not find any evidence that makes me agree that Osama bin Laden was behind the attack on the twin trade towers. All we have heard from him was simply a praise and commendation of those who had carried out the operation.\" Natana DeLong-Bas, then a lecturer at Boston College and Brandeis University, now associate professor of theology at BC. From a December 21 2006 interview in Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, translated by MEMRI, January 2, 2007.<\/p> <p>Careful scholars are hesitant to pass judgment on people or events before they've sifted all the evidence, and by late 2006 our intrepid professor hadn't finished her primary source research on the events of over half a decade before. We would love to know what other hypotheses she's studied: was it the Bilderbergers, the Masons, or the Mossad? Hopefully, the long wait for an answer from DeLong-Bas will end soon. Enlighten us, professor!<\/p> <p>Former PLO spokesman Rashid Khalidi: \"For American Likudniks and their Israeli counterparts ... September 11 was a godsend.\"<\/p> <p>10. \"[The neoconservatives] are convinced that the Middle East is irremediably hostile to both the United States and Israel; and they firmly hold the racist view that Middle Easterners understand only force. For these American Likudniks and their Israeli counterparts, sad to say, the tragedy of September 11 was a godsend: It enabled them to draft the United States to help fight Israel's enemies.\" Rashid Khalidi, Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies and then-director of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University. From In These Times, January 27, 2003.<\/p> <p>Listen, as a former PLO spokesman in the 1980s, Khalidi's job was to be on top of all the intel, so when he says that Likudniks were happy about 9\/11, we take him at his word.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"36QZ6V158BSCCJJZPPKPK4J5V48SUN"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":201,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":926797406,"Input.title":"British photographer arrested and charged in US for covering protests","Input.publish_date":"2020-06-01 14:46:27+01:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>A BRITISH photographer has been arrested and charged by cops in New York while covering police brutality protests in the US.<\/p> <p>Adam Gray, chief photographer for British news agency SWNS, was held in prison, in close proximity to 70 others with his PPE mask confiscated, for more than 10-and-a-half hours.<\/p> <p>The 33-year-old was on assignment for The Sun US in New York when he was apprehended by several officers, forced to the ground, and his equipment damaged.<\/p> <p>The incident, which is reported to have taken place near Union Square amid widespread protests across the country, came despite the photographer holding full press credentials.<\/p> <p>Mr Gray said he has now been \u201ccharged with unlawful assembly for taking pictures of protesters and police,\u201d and will appear in court later this year.<\/p> <p>He added: \u201cNo social distancing was possible and many prisoners had their masks taken off them for a photo and not returned or provided with new ones.

Other laws that unduly restrict freedom of expression should also be repealed or substantially amended, including the vaguely worded and excessively punitive Law on Cybersecurity.<\/p> <p>In its most recent review of Viet Nam in 2019, the UN Human Rights Committee, the body tasked with monitoring the implementation of the ICCPR, stated that Viet Nam\u2019s \u201cdomestic legal framework remains incompatible with the Covenant\u201d and highlighted Articles 117 and 331 of the Criminal Code in addition to the Law on Cybersecurity for their non-compliance with the requirements of the Covenant.<\/p> <p>Big Tech must end complicity in Viet Nam\u2019s censorship regime<\/p> <p>Viet Nam has long maintained strict censorship of the press, yet the expansion of social media in recent years has significantly opened up the space for public debate and the exchange of ideas and opinions among the general public.<\/p> <p>As documented in Amnesty International\u2019s December 2020 report, \u2018Let Us Breathe!\u2019: Censorship and criminalization of online expression in Viet Nam, this technological revolution has led Viet Nam\u2019s censors and security forces to unleash a major crackdown on online expression.<\/p> <p>A large and growing proportion of prisoners of conscience in Viet Nam are imprisoned based on their expression online, with 41% of those recognized by Amnesty International behind bars because of peaceful online speech.<\/p> <p>In addition to imprisoning people based on their social media posts, Vietnamese authorities have increasingly enlisted tech giants Facebook and YouTube to implement censorship on their behalf.<\/p> <p>\u201cWith these impending changes in national leadership, both the Vietnamese authorities and big tech have a chance to reset their approach. They must protect online expression in line with international human rights law and standards,\u201d said Yamini Mishra.<\/p> <p>Longstanding human rights concerns must be addressed<\/p> <p>Viet Nam has a long and pressing list of human rights concerns which require urgent remedial action by the incoming party and government leadership.<\/p> <p>The country still imposes the death penalty and undertakes executions in violation of the right to life. Amnesty International reiterates the organization\u2019s longstanding call for this ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishmentto be abolished in Viet Nam and everywhere.<\/p> <p>Ethnic and religious minorities also continue to face serious discrimination on the basis of their ethnic and religious identities and perceived political beliefs. Violence against women and girls, and in particular intimate partner violence, remains a serious and widespread concern.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn setting policy for the coming five years, the CPV must set its sights on meeting international human rights standards.

Human Rights Watch welcomes the submission of this state report and in conformity with Rules 74 and 75 of the Rules of Procedure of the ACHPR, Human Rights Watch (Observer Status number 17) submits this shadow report. This report includes findings from Human Rights Watch research into the human rights situation of Cameroon. The report covers violations of the right to life (article 4); the right to equal protection under the law (article 3); arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and other ill treatments (article 5 and 6); and violations of freedom of speech and assembly (article 9, 10 & 11).<\/p> <p>Background: Crisis in the Anglophone Regions<\/p> <p>The Anglophone North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon have been embroiled in a deepening human rights and humanitarian crisis since late October 2016, when teachers, lawyers, students, and activists, who had long complained of what they perceive to be marginalization of the two regions by the central government, took to the streets to demand more recognition of their political, social, and cultural rights. Government forces have responded by violently cracking down on peaceful protests, arbitrarily arresting local activists and peaceful protesters, curtailing the activities of civil society, and blocking access to the internet. Armed separatists have also killed, tortured, and kidnapped dozens of civilians, including teachers, students, and government officials.The crisis has led to the displacement of over 679,000 people, deprived more than 600,000 children from schooling in the two Anglophone regions, and claimed more than 3,000 lives.<\/p> <p>On September 10, amid increasing violence and following sustained international pressure, President Biya called for a \u201cnational dialogue,\u201d a series of nationwide discussions aimed at addressing the crisis. The dialogue ended with the adoption of a special status for the two Anglophone regions and the release of hundreds of political prisoners, including Maurice Kamto, leader of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) opposition party, and other persons arrested in connection with the unrest in the North-West and South-West regions.<\/p> <p>Abuses by armed separatists<\/p> <p>Armed separatists demanding the secession of the North-West and South-West regions from the Cameroonian state have killed, tortured, and kidnapped hundreds of civilians, including teachers, students, clergy, members and supporters of political parties, and government officials. Human Rights Watch has documented hundreds of cases of kidnapping of civilians by armed separatists. Most of the abductees were released after a ransom was paid.<\/p> <p>Since early 2017, separatists have consistently targeted school buildings and threatened education officials and students with violence if they did not comply with separatist demands to boycott schools. They have also used schools as bases, deploying fighters and weapons in and near them, including in Koppin village (Mezam division), Tenkha village (Ngoketunjia division), and Mbuluf (Bui division), Bali (Mezam division).<\/p> <p>In one case, on February 16, a group of armed separatists abducted 170 students, mostly girls under 18, a teacher, and two guards from a boarding school in Kumbo, North-West region. They were all released the following day amid rumors of ransoms being paid..<\/p> <p>On June 18, separatists kidnapped at least 40 people, including women and children, beat and robbed them in Bafut, North-West region. They were released the following day.<\/p> <p>On June 28, armed separatists beat and kidnapped John Fru Ndi, a well-known Cameroonian politician, from his home in Bamenda, North-West region. Three days before, armed separatists abducted and released another high-profile figure, Cornelius Fontem Esua, the archbishop of Bamenda.<\/p> <p>In November, members of the Restoration Forces armed separatist group kidnapped 20 candidates for the February 9, 2020 municipal elections in the town of Jakiri, North-West region. The officials were held in a small house near a separatist camp in Vekovi village. They were released on December 8, after ransom payments believed to range between the amounts of 250,000 and 500,000 CFA ($419-$838) were paid for each abductee.<\/p> <p>On January 5, 2020, armed separatists from the Restoration Forces group led by a commander known as \u201cGeneral Man Pass Man\u201d kidnapped the mayor of Babessi, North-West region, along with four council members in Babessi. The Restoration Forces released them on January 22, following a ransom payment of 1,000,000 CFA (US$1,678). The separatists had also kidnapped and tortured the Babessi mayor in June 2019.<\/p> <p>Violations of Freedom of Assembly and Arbitrary Arrest and Detention of Opposition Members and Supporters (Articles 9, 10 &11)<\/p> <p>Throughout 2019 Cameroonian authorities and security forces arrested hundreds of members and supporters of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) opposition party and violently dispersed peaceful protests.<\/p> <p>In late January 2019, CRM leader Maurice Kamto was arbitrarily arrested along with over 200 members and supporters of his party, including his closest advisors. Security forces fired teargas into the crowd and rubber bullets from close range to disperse protesters.<\/p> <p>Kamto and other CRM leaders were unable to meet their lawyers for several days and were later charged before a military court with a number of offenses including hostility against the homeland, threats to public order and rebellion. Those charges appeared to be politically motivated.<\/p> <p>In June 2019, at least 350 CRM members and supporters were arbitrarily arrested after they attempted to hold demonstrations across the country.<\/p> <p>Almost all CRM members and supporters, including Kamto, were released on October 5, following a Presidential decree. Sixteen of them, however, including Mamadou Yacouba, CRM Vice President, remain in detention as of February 2020.<\/p> <p>Issues not addressed in the 6th Periodic Report:<\/p> <p>Cameroon\u2019s 6th Periodic Report (the Report) does not mention the arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition members or of the violent dispersal of demonstrators by members of the security forces. It also does not describe any measures taken by the Government of Cameroon to mitigate violations of freedom of assembly and public demonstration. The Report states instead that \u201cfreedom of assembly and public demonstration is guaranteed by Law No. 90\/55.\u201d However, the government of Cameroon failed to uphold those freedoms for opposition members arrested during and following peaceful demonstrations, as documented by Human Rights Watch.<\/p> <p>The arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds of opposition members and supporters and the subsequent impediment of their access to legal assistance is contrary to Cameroon\u2019s own laws pertaining to freedom of assembly and its obligations as a state party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. It also reflects a climate of rapidly shrinking political and civic space.<\/p> <p>Suggested questions for the ACHPR to pose to the delegation from the government of Cameroon:<\/p> <p>Could you please provide a response to allegations of torture documented in an August 2019 report by Human Rights Watch including the incommunicado detention and torture in detention of more than 100 detainees in the State Defense Secretariat (SED) between July 23 -August 4, 2019 in Yaound\u00e9? Has the government initiated any investigations into allegations of abuse and torture in detention by security forces, including the following: The enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention of 26 individuals between January 2018 and January 2019 in the SED detention site The torture of 14 individuals between January 2018 and January 2019 in the SED detention site. The alleged systematic use of torture to extract confessions from detainees in the SED detention site. Has the government initiated any investigations into allegations of abuses by security forces in the context of counter-insurgency operations in the North-West and South-West regions, including: The destruction of property in the North-West and South-West regions between November 2018 and January 2020, including the burning of more than 60 homes in Abuh village in November 2018. Alleged unlawful killings of civilians by security forces in the North-West and South-West regions since November 2018. Have there been any prosecutions, convictions or disciplinary actions taken against officials or security force members involved in the human rights violations described in the August 2019 Human Rights Watch report? If so, could you provide detailed information about the number of cases, the nature of the crimes, the actions taken, and the status of the cases? Has the government taken any concrete measures to mitigate further abuses by security forces? If so, could you please provide any details and documentation of these measures?<\/p> <p>Recommendations:<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:<\/p> <p>Immediately end the practice of arbitrary arrests and detention of civilians, including opposition members and supporters, for exercising their freedom of expression and assembly.<\/p> <p>Immediately put an end to the use of military courts to try civilians.<\/p> <p>Ensure that security forces deployed to protests with the purpose of protecting public order are trained to respect human rights during their operations and refrain from using excessive force.<\/p> <p>Monitor failures to implement domestic laws and policies related to freedom of expression and assembly.<\/p> <p>Thoroughly investigate all allegations of excessive use of force by members of the security forces during protests, regardless of victims\u2019 political affiliation, and ensure that those implicated in abuses are adequately disciplined.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Violations by Government Forces<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch\u2019s research shows how human rights violations by government forces have been rife since the crisis in the Anglophone regions began in late 2016. Security forces have killed civilians, burned dozens of villages, and arbitrarily arrested and tortured hundreds of alleged armed separatists.<\/p> <p>Destruction of property (article 14)<\/p> <p>In one case, security forces burned down more than 60 homes in Abuh village, North-West region, in a three-day security operation carried out in November 2018. Human Rights Watch has confirmed the burning through satellite imagery.<\/p> <p>On November 22, 2018 gendarmes burned at least 13 houses in Bali village, North-West region.<\/p> <p>Between December 3 and 6, 2018, following clashes between the military and armed separatists, security forces burned over 55 houses in areas of Kumbo known as SAC Junction and Romajay, as well as in Meluf, Kikaikom, and Nyaro, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning of houses through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses\u2019 accounts.<\/p> <p>On May 15, 2019, following the killing of two Air Force soldiers by suspected armed separatists, security forces burned over 70 homes in Mankon, Bamenda, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses\u2019 accounts.<\/p> <p>Between January 17 and 20, 2020, security forces searching for armed separatists burned down over 50 homes in Bali, North-West region. Human Rights Watch confirmed the burning through satellite imagery consistent with witnesses\u2019 accounts.<\/p> <p>Unlawful killings (articles 4 & 5)<\/p> <p>On October 21, 2018 soldiers and gendarmes attacked Rom and Nsah villages and unlawfully killed at least four civilians, including a young man with a physical disability.<\/p> <p>On December 5, 2018 the army unlawfully killed seven people in Meluf village, North-West region, including a 70-year-old man with a hearing impairment who was burned inside his neighbor\u2019s home.<\/p> <p>On January 18, 2019 soldiers unlawfully killed a 28-year-old nurse who was seven months pregnant, while she was on her way to work in Kumbo, North-West region.<\/p> <p>On February 6, 2019 soldiers from the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) stormed the market of Bole Bakundu village, South-West region, and unlawfully killed up to 10 men. Community members said they believed that security forces were retaliating against civilians accused of collaborating with the separatists.<\/p> <p>On April 4, 2019, Cameroonian soldiers, gendarmes, and members of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) carried out a deadly attack on the North-West region village of Meluf. They unlawfully killed five civilian men, including one with a mental disability. Three of the bodies were later found mutilated, including one that had been decapitated.<\/p> <p>On May 15, 2019, following the killing of two Air Force soldiers by suspected armed separatists, security forces unlawfully killed a 41-year-old man in Alachu, Bamenda, North-West region.<\/p> <p>On July 10, 2019, soldiers from the Cameroonian Air Force, unlawfully killed a 20-year-old man with a mental disability, and another civilian, during security operations searching for armed separatists in Alachu neighborhood of the city of Bamenda, north-West region.<\/p> <p>Soldiers, including members of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), and gendarmes unlawfully killed at least 4 civilians, including two men with intellectual disabilities, in a security operation in Bali village between January 17- 20, 2020.<\/p> <p>Torture and incommunicado detention (articles 3, 5, & 6)<\/p> <p>The Government of Cameroon publicly declared in 2017 that torture does not take place in Cameroon, however Human Rights Watch continues to receive reports of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment in detention. Cameroon\u2019s Periodic Report fails to demonstrate any progress on investigating the use of torture in detention and does not provide any evidence of cases brought before courts to hold to account security force members implicated in torture or ill-treatment in detention since 2017.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch documented 26 cases of incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance and 14 cases of torture at the State Defense Secretariat (Secretariat d\u2019Etat a la defense, SED) in Yaound\u00e9 between January 2018 and January 2019. Between July 23 and August 4, 2019 Cameroonian authorities held more than 100 people in incommunicado detention and tortured many of them in the SED prison in Yaound\u00e9. Former detainees described low- to mid-ranking gendarmes using methods of torture, including severe beatings and near drownings, to humiliate, punish, and extract confessions from detainees, most of whom were civilians detained for suspected ties to armed separatist groups.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch also documented that Cameroonian authorities held over 100 detainees in incommunicado detention and tortured many of them in SED, Yaound\u00e9, from July 23 to August 4, 2019. The detainees were transferred to the facility the morning after inmates in Yaound\u00e9\u2019s Central Prison rioted on July 22 in protest against overcrowding, dire living conditions, and delays in their cases getting to trial. The whereabouts of the majority of the detainees was unknown for almost two weeks. On August 3, 2019 the day after official acknowledgement of the whereabouts of the detainees, some lawyers were finally able to meet with some of their clients at the SED. Human Rights Watch interviewed 14 detainees held at the SED, all of whom said they were tortured and held incommunicado during their time there, and heard credible accounts that scores more were also tortured.<\/p> <p>Sexual violence (articles 3 & 4, Maputo Protocol)<\/p> <p>Cameroon\u2019s 6th Periodic Report states that \u201cfrom 2013 to 2017, 313 elements of Defence (sic) Forces were prosecuted before the courts for different offences,\u201d including rape and attempted rape, and notes that 30 of the 313 were convicted and sentenced. The Report however fails to provide evidence of any efforts on the part of the Government of Cameroon to prosecute those implicated in human rights violations, including sexual violence, committed in the Anglophone regions since late 2017, or any details of cases brought against security forces which were tried before courts.<\/p> <p>The Report states that Sections 295 and 296 of the Penal Code introduced new penalties for offences of rape and Sections 346 and 347 include punishments for \u201coffences on minors accompanied by sexual intercourse or rape.\u201d The Report affirms that 264 cases of rape were prosecuted in 2016 and 309 were prosecuted in 2017, however the Report fails to provide evidence of any investigations or prosecutions of cases of sexual violence. Human Rights Watch documented four cases of sexual violence by security force members. Two women and one girl from a locality in the North-West region each said that BIR soldiers raped them in January 2019. In another case in June 2019, a soldier reportedly raped a woman in Kumbo, North-West region. Human Rights Watch spoke to aid workers in the North-West and South-West regions who expressed concerns that there are many more cases of sexual violence by security forces which go unreported due to survivors\u2019 fear of social stigma.<\/p> <p>Recommendations:<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:<\/p> <p>Take steps, in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the Maputo Protocol, to guarantee the life, dignity, integrity and security of civilians, including specific measures to protect women and girls and to mitigate the risk of sexual violence.<\/p> <p>Direct local authorities, including law enforcement officials members of the security forces, to protect civilians, including women, girls, and children, in the Anglophone regions from the threat of kidnapping and hold to account authorities who fail in their duties to uphold the safety and security of all civilians, regardless of gender and ethno-linguistic identity.<\/p> <p>Initiate prompt, independent, and impartial investigations into allegations of rape and sexual and gender-based violence by armed separatists and security forces with the aim of bringing perpetrators to justice.<\/p> <p>Ensure adequate health and psychosocial services, including comprehensive post-rape medical care, are available to survivors of sexual violence by security forces.<\/p> <p>Conclusion<\/p> <p>Cameroon has submitted 6 reports in the last 18 years. Cameroon\u2019s 6th periodic report fails to provide any comprehensive account of efforts to mitigate further abuses by security forces against civilians and to ensure that military operations are conducted with respect for human rights. The Report only claims that the International School for Security Forces (EIFORCES) offers a two-week course on human rights and protection of vulnerable persons. The course, albeit useful, can hardly address the urgent need for the government to effectively enforce respect for human rights by security forces and accountability for those who fail to do so. Human Rights Watch continues to document cases of serious abuses by Cameroonian security forces, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, the burning of hundreds of homes, torture and incommunicado detention.These abuses should be addressed by holding the perpetrators to account.<\/p> <p>Final Recommendations:<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch urges the government of Cameroon to:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3X0EMNLXER4FC6S72YQ0LLGDMRAPVT"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":941,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2013.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cameroon","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maurice Kamto","victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement leader, arrested, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement members, political prisoner, arrested","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"students, kidnapped, hostage, civillian, torture, separatists","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"women, girls, rape, torture, state soldiers","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"killings, Rom and Nsah, Meluf, Kumbo, Bole Bakundu, Alachu, Bali village","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2013.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Cameroon","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maurice Kamto","victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement leader, arrested, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Cameroon Renaissance Movement members, political prisoner, arrested","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"students, kidnapped, hostage, civillian, torture, separatists","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"women, girls, rape, torture, state soldiers","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"killings, Rom and Nsah, Meluf, Kumbo, Bole Bakundu, Alachu, Bali village","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":972349378,"Input.title":"Factbox: The violence and insecurity affecting Nigeria","Input.publish_date":"2021-03-02 10:34:50","Input.article_interface":"<p>(Reuters) - Gunmen have freed all 279 girls who were kidnapped from a boarding school in northwest Nigeria on Friday, officials said on Tuesday.<\/p> <p>Girls who were kidnapped from a boarding school in the northwest Nigerian state of Zamfara, walk in line after their release in Zamfara, Nigeria March 2, 2021.

The former Soviet state has been in turmoil ever since President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who has been in power for the past 27 years, claimed a landslide victory despite widespread evidence that the election was neither free nor fair and that opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was the likely winner.<\/p> <p>Before the election results were even announced, tens of thousands of people spontaneously gathered to peacefully protest the conduct of the election and to oppose the Lukashenko regime. The days that followed (9-11 August) were the most violent period in the country\u2019s recent history: up to 7,000 protesters were arrested, many of them beaten and tortured by security forces, with three people dying at the hands of police. Then, between 17 and 18 August, workers across the country took part in strike action to support the democratic protests. Although protests continued until November, and despite international condemnation, Lukashenko refused to concede instead, more than 35,000 people have been arrested over the past year; opposition politicians, trade unionists, journalists, members of civil society, human rights lawyers and protesters have all been targeted with criminal prosecutions, and strict new laws have been introduced to further impede everything from press freedom to freedom of association. Scores of activists have fled the country, and dissents in exile have been kidnapped or found dead.<\/p> <p>Protests, walk-outs and work stoppages from workers at some of Belarus\u2019s biggest heavy industries \u2013 such as Belaruskali, the world\u2019s largest potash (potato fertiliser) producer, and the Minsk Wheeled Tractor Plant (MZKT), where Lukashenko was famously heckled by factory workers \u2013 played a key role in this moment.<\/p> <p>Workers formed strike committees to prepare for a general strike in support of democratic change. Their demands were simple: fresh elections, the release of all political prisoners, an independent investigation into police violence, a guarantee that protesting employees would not be persecuted by employers and state authorities, and an end to the system of short-term job contracts that dominates Belarus\u2019s economy.<\/p> <p>On the one-year anniversary of the start of the protests, Julia Sliuko, a plasterer at Hrodnaprambud, a state-owned construction company in the western city of Grodno (also known as Hrodna), remembers the week that changed everything. Until last year, she says she was apolitical, focusing her energy on raising her 12-year-old son. But that changed last August when she witnessed police beat an unarmed man shortly after the disputed poll. Over the following days Julia spoke to co-workers, many of whom were also beaten by police, about current events. \u201cAfter witnessing this violence, I understood that nothing would be the same anymore. I felt change in the air.\u201d A few days later she would be elected as chairperson of her company\u2019s strike committee and would later stand on stage in front of thousands of Grodno citizens to speak about how the company management tried to suppress the strike: \u201cThey tried to send us on vacation or even suggest money. But we are not for sale. We are with you,\u201d she told the crowd.<\/p> <p>These spontaneous assemblies took place all over Belarus for several days in August, during which time dozens of enterprises saw workers going on strike. \u201cWe hoped that justice would prevail,\u201d says Julia when asked why she and her colleagues went on strike. \u201cWe hoped that law enforcement would not continue to go against the people.\u201d At Belaruskali, for example, which is one of the most successful state-owned companies in Belarus, almost 6,200 of the company\u2019s 17,000 workers supported the idea of post-election strike action (although after coming under significant pressure, only 140 workers actually went on strike). On 10 September, Belaruskali miner and Belarusian Independent Trade Union (BITU) member Yury Korzun chained himself to a piece of mining equipment 305-metres below ground: \u201cI wanted to inspire my colleagues to join the strike. How could I work, when the money we bring to this company goes to law enforcement, who beat peaceful people? To not take action is to put the life of my family at risk,\u201d Yury tells Equal Times.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a strike, it was a revolt\u201d<\/p> <p>President Lukashenko was elected as Belarus\u2019s first post-Soviet president in 1994 and is currently serving his sixth term. Since he took power there has not been a free or fair election, there is no separation of power between the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature, the media is tightly muzzled, and opposition politicians and journalists are routinely jailed. It has become nearly impossible to publicly express political views which oppose Lukashenko\u2019s: since 2019, protest organisers are obliged to provide local authorities with at least 10 days\u2019 notice for any kind of rally; they also have to pay for utilities, medical assistance and police security, with the latter costing up to \u20ac2,500 for an assembly of more than 1,000 people. In a country where the average monthly salary is \u20ac473, this puts legal protests and rallies out of the reach of most working people.<\/p> <p>Organising an authorised strike is just as difficult. \u201cLegally, there is the right to strike, but in reality, it is not feasible,\u201d says Maxim Pazniakou, chairman of the BITU. Before calling a strike, a trade union must have exhausted all possible solutions, such as negotiations with the employer, which have no time limit according to law. For a strike to be legal, it must be backed by over 50 per cent of workers and organisers must approve the strike with several governmental bodies, giving them a minimum of two weeks\u2019 notice. In addition, a strike can be deemed illegal by authorities at any stage. \u201cIn August last year, no one knew how to organise a strike, says Aliaksandar Yarashuk, president of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP). \u201cThe last one happened back in 1995. As a result, most active strikers were at those enterprises where independent trade unions are present. Because only they knew how to organise a strike,\u201d he explains.<\/p> <p>When in August 2020 workers called for strike action in support of the pro-democracy protests, many employers responded by saying that because the workers\u2019 demands were political and nothing to do with pay or working conditions, employers had no obligation to respond to their demands.<\/p> <p>However, as more than 65 per cent of all industrial products in Belarus are produced by fully or partially state-owned enterprises, the potential that workers have to use democratic organisations (trade unions) to advance democratic reform in the political sphere is significant. \u201cWhat happened in August wasn\u2019t a strike, it was more like a revolt. The state took all possibilities from workers to strike legally, but they still have the civil right to do so,\u201d says Yarashuk. In response, the regime cracked down on striking workers with threats, arrests and sackings. For example, Julia from Hrodnaprambud was fired at the beginning of September. Dozens of her co-workers quit in solidarity.<\/p> <p>Most trade union members in Belarus (four million) belong to the state-aligned Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus (FTUB), a relic of the Soviet system complete with the participation of government ministers in the union\u2019s decision-making bodies. About 10,000 workers are currently represented by the independent BKDP. Paradoxically, while in the aftermath of the pro-democracy uprising more and more workers are joining independent unions, these unions are operating in a shrinking space. As outlined in the 2021 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights Index: \u201cSeveral union offices were raided [following the 9 August election], and the police have been forcing unions to hand over personal information about their members, causing serious concern about action against people who have exercised their right to join a union. Union representatives were abducted on their way to work by security services and subjected to interrogation and arbitrary detention. Workers were sentenced to long prison sentences for supporting strike action and protests.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to new labour law amendments, which were brought into force this summer, strikes with political demands are now illegal. It is also forbidden to organise a strike at enterprises where hazardous manufacturing takes place and workers can now be fired for simply calling a strike. At its annual International Labour Conference in June 2020, the International Labour Organization (ILO) strongly criticised the violation of international labour standards taking place in Belarus, calling on the Belarusian authorities to reinstate workers, drop all charges related to participation in protests and to make new amendments to protect workers and trade union activists against discrimination, but Lukashenko\u2019s government rejected the findings and today remains bullish. \u201cWe are running out of means to defend our members,\u201d says Andrei Hanevich, leader of the independent trade union at GrodnoAzot, a chemical state-owned enterprise. \u201cEmployers can do anything they want.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cA modern form of slavery\u201d<\/p> <p>Under Lukashenko, a raft of neoliberal labour laws have been brought in to create flexibility. For example, since 1999, Belarusian labour law has allowed for a maximum employment contract of just five years. As a result, many employers tend to extend contracts from year to year, which means workers have little to no job security and are constantly afraid of losing their jobs. On the other hand, employees cannot leave a job before the end of their contracted term, if an employer doesn\u2018t agree to it. \u201cThis system is one of the reasons why our labour code is one of the worst in Europe. We call it a modern form of slavery,\u201d says Yarashuk.<\/p> <p>Moreover, according to the new amendments it is now legal to fire an individual if they serve an administrative term [editor\u2019s note: in Belarusian law, offenses can be given criminal or administrative punishments, such as a fine or a short jail term]. For example, thousands of people were punished with up to 15 days imprisonment for taking part in demonstrations; under Belarusian labour law this is now treated as the sackable offense of truancy. \u201cLast autumn many workers were fired due to their administrative term. We are suing many such employers because at that time it was illegal,\u201d says Pazniakou. One such worker who got fired this way is the miner Yury Korzun. The day he chained himself underground was his last working day; he later served two 15-day prison terms in a row and in the winter, he spent a further month in prison.<\/p> <p>The majority of people who went on strike were fired from their jobs and many enterprises like GrodnoAzot have refused to extend the contracts of workers active in the protests. \u201cLast year state enterprises fired people not because they were in breach of contract or for being unprofessional, but because they were politically disloyal,\u201d says Yarashuk. The local branch of the BITU tried to initiate negotiations with factory management and persuade them to reinstate (according to the union) illegally fired employees. In July Belarusian media reported that GrodnoAzot need more than 350 workers. \u201cThere is definitely a big lack of staff. It looks like they have a list of people, with whom they will not extend contracts,\u201d says Hanevich.<\/p> <p>The dissolution of independent trade unions?<\/p> <p>Independent trade unions are in a very precarious position in Belarus. Over the past few months authorities have practically destroyed the free media, arresting almost 30 journalists. More than 50 NGOs have been dissolved, among them not only human rights groups, but also charitable organisations. \u201cWe are expecting the dissolution of independent trade unions any moment now,\u201d says Yarashuk. Last month the offices of the Belarusian Radio and Electronic Industry Workers\u2019 Union were raided by the police and its chairperson was forced to leave the country. In addition, Mikola Sharah, the chairperson of the Free Trade Union of Belarus and human rights activist was arrested and detained for three days as a suspect in a criminal case about \u2018damage of property\u2019, resulting in the confiscation of his computers and mobile phones. \u201cRecently our branches in the towns of Polatsk and Pinsk were refused to get registration. The same could happen in [the town of] Bobruisk,\u201d says Sharah.<\/p> <p>Last autumn, hundreds of new members joined the independent trade unions, with \u2013 according to the BKPD \u2013 state trade unions losing about 20 per cent of their members. Some of those workers, like Siarhei Lapunou, joined independent structures instead. Lapunou worked at the state-owned oil refinery Naftan and used to be an FTUB member, but after the election he no longer wanted to support a pro-Lukashenko organisation: the chairperson of the FTUB, Mikhail Orda, managed Lukashenko\u2019s election campaign and the union forced workers to sign for Lukashenko\u2019s candidacy as presidential candidates need to gather at least 100,000 signatures.<\/p> <p>At Naftan, Lapunou says that many members of the independent trade union are discriminated against: they are threatened with dismissal and the deprivation of bonuses if they stay in the \u2018wrong\u2019 trade union.<\/p> <p>\u201cIndependent trade unions are great things, but only when they function in a state of law. In our country, the law doesn\u2018t work any more,\u201d Lapunou laments.<\/p> <p>After protests broke out at state factories Lukashenko visited some of them himself and personally tried to calm down workers. He addressed workers on stage at MZKT, only to be told to \u201cgo away!\u201d by some of the crowd. Of the incident, Yarashuk says: \u201cLukashenko understood that workers are the only force, thanks to which state power can be transferred peacefully. It was big psychological trauma for him at MZKT and we are still experiencing the consequences of this,\u201d he says, citing labour law amendments and the repression faced by independent trade unions, union activists and workers as examples.<\/p> <p>So, with Lukashenko still in power one year later, did the strikes change anything? For Yarashuk, the strikes were successful in weakening Lukashenko\u2019s political position. \u201cHe now knows that almost 70 per cent of the workers don\u2019t trust the authorities.\u201d There are other bright spots, too: some of the workers fired from Belaruskali have been reinstated showing that even in a repressive environment, gains can be achieved through collective action; and fledgling independent trade unions have been formed in the healthcare and education sectors.<\/p> <p>But overall, those who rose up against Lukashenko have paid a heavy price. Many new members of independent unions are under pressure from employers to leave, which keeps member numbers low, and the labour movement has lost many unions at many factories (such as the Minsk Automobile Plant and MZKT) because activists and members were fired since August 2020. Yarashuk is positive that now that the seed of independent trade unions has been planted, at some point they will flourish: \u201cThey can dissolve the unions, but they can\u2019t destroy the idea.\u201d<\/p> <p>In the meantime, many of the strikers have been forced to leave the country. Julia Sliuko went to Poland with her son in October last year to avoid a jail term. She now works as a manicurist and organises protests in the Polish capital of Warsaw. Siarhei Lapunou from Naftan left for Poland two months ago, and together with other strikers, he survives by doing odd jobs. One of his friends, Valery, who also took part in the 2020 strikes, is a father of three children, one of whom has a disability. Although things aren\u2019t easy in Poland, he plans to remain in exile until Lukashenko is gone: \u201cI know we will return to Belarus some day, but I understand that victory may not come soon.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3YCT0L9OMOOZHTZQSO8369RBN8FSNV"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":638,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"August","date":"9.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Belarus, protests, arrests, killing, Lukashenko opposition, union members, human rights, lawyers, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"August","date":"9.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Belarus, protests, arrests, killing, Lukashenko opposition, union members, human rights, lawyers, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":904302123,"Input.title":"Death scene at John Vorster Square was neglectfully pro...","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Neil Aggett was a white South African doctor and trade union organiser who died while in detention after being arrested by the South African Security Police in 1982. (Photo: Chris Collingridge)<\/p> <p>Neil Aggett was alive at the moment he was strung up against the bars in the John Vorster Square (now Johannesburg Central Police Station) prison cell where he was found hanged.<\/p> <p>He may not have been conscious, but he was certainly \u201cvital\u201d. This is the conclusion of pathologist Dr Steve Naidoo who presented his testimony yesterday, Thursday 6 February, at the reopened inquest into the death of the trade unionist and doctor who was found dead in detention in 1982.<\/p> <p>Naidoo said Aggett\u2019s body showed injuries consistent with \u201cvital reactions\u201d \u2013 the live body\u2019s reaction to the impact of being hanged. There were two distinct haemorrhages that Naidoo pointed out could not have occurred after death.<\/p> <p>Naidoo also said that death occurred in one of two possible ways. The first \u201cmechanism of death\u201d would have involved the closing and compression around the carotid arteries that are on each side of the neck that would have caused unconsciousness in seconds and then death within a minute or two.<\/p> <p>The other possibility he outlined would have been as a result of the neck being constricted and the sudden gravitational traction from being hanged that would have caused a rapid drop of blood pressure, and in turn a slowing of the heart and then death minutes later.<\/p> <p>He said in his affidavit: \u201cThe only reasonable conclusion in this case is that the death was caused by the state of suspensory hanging of the body by constrictive ligature around the neck.\u201d<\/p> <p>Naidoo, who was the independent pathologist commissioned by the pro bono attorneys working on behalf of the Aggett family, spent most of his time on the stand showing up the \u201ctroubling shortcomings\u201d and inconsistencies, the lack of supervisory oversight and outright professional neglect in how the death scene was processed and how the post mortem processes were carried out.<\/p> <p>Key among the failings that Naidoo pointed out were the absence of photographs of the body at the death scene. There were also no autopsy photographs taken under correct lighting and guidance of a pathologist with labels, measurements and scales. There are only two grainy black and white photos of Aggett\u2019s body when it was hanging from the prison cell bars.<\/p> <p>In political cases, the State\u2019s chief pathologist was also responsible for overseeing an autopsy, not a district surgeon as was the case with Aggett.<\/p> <p>\u201cA death of a political detainee from hanging would always have come with a query and a challenge. A chief pathologist present at the death scene and conducting the autopsy would have been able to narrow the window of possibility from the precise nature of the ligature (a kikoi is the item that appears around Aggett\u2019s neck at the death scene), how this ligature lay, how it was tied and importantly the possibility of someone securing the ligature to themselves,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Naidoo said the autopsy was rushed and was completed just seven hours after the recorded discovery of the body at 1.30am on 5 February 1982.<\/p> <p>He added: \u201cThe family was not given the time and pre-counselling in order to digest and prepare and to bring in a private pathologist from the beginning. So the family\u2019s rights were disregarded.\u201d<\/p> <p>Naidoo also said the post mortem didn\u2019t include processes to reveal subcutaneous bruising that doesn\u2019t appear on the skin, even though the technique was already in use at the time.<\/p> <p>Naidoo continues his testimony on Friday. The precise and graphic details of what happened to Aggett\u2019s body in the moments leading to his death are what Aggett\u2019s family and friends have had to hear in the South Gauteng High Court.<\/p> <p>These details have given the likes of Liz Floyd answers. Floyd was Aggett\u2019s partner. She\u2019s also a medical doctor and recently retired from her position at the Gauteng Department of Health.<\/p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to look at the photos, not till this time last year, and the more I looked the more I could see that there was something wrong. I also volunteered to translate the jargon in the medical reports for the legal team and when I started comparing what the doctors had written in their reports and what I remembered I saw the contradictions,\u201d Floyd said outside the court on Thursday.<\/p> <p>Floyd had till then accepted that Aggett had been driven to suicide. She herself was severely tortured and suffered post-traumatic stress after Aggett\u2019s death and her own detention.<\/p> <p>Floyd\u2019s medical background, as well as her personal connection to Aggett, makes for a unique lens through which she can communicate about the medical and forensic findings.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also that it\u2019s 38 years later,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe are going through an inquest this time where there isn\u2019t extreme intimidation, hostility and threat to our personal safety. We also have the support of our loved ones and the support of other detainees \u2013 it\u2019s like a family reunion and we\u2019re catching up on all the gossip,\u201d she says with a giggle.<\/p> <p>It makes hearing graphic details about Aggett\u2019s dying just that tiny bit more bearable.

Politically savvy Caesar used his military triumphs as a general and his political alliances to advance his career, serving first as the governor of Spain\u2014at the time, a province of Rome\u2014and then as the governor of Gaul, the region of Europe that today includes France and Belgium. As the governor of Gaul, he enriched himself, using his wealth to support his army when he crossed the Rubicon River, initiating a civil war with the Roman general Pompey, whom Caesar defeated. Caesar\u2019s triumph was followed by his proclamation that he was now the dictator of Rome.<\/p> <p>Caesar was also a man of letters whose oratorical mastery led the famous teacher and rhetorician Quintilian to hold him in high regard. As The Conquest of Gaul points out, Caesar\u2019s \u201celegance of language\u201d put him nearly on par with Rome\u2019s greatest orator, Cicero. Caesar\u2019s Commentaries on the Gallic War and the Civil War, although non-fiction, are described as \u201cso elegantly and lucidly written that they compel\u2026admiration even without the addition of further ornament.\u201d<\/p> <p>Gifted both in public speaking and writing, Caesar brought his immense writing talent to bear on poetry as well, writing The Journey, allegedly while traveling to Spain.

Garibaldi obeyed the king\u2019s decree, surrendered his dictatorial powers, and returned to Caprera, slighted and humiliated by the king, who arrived with his army just in time to end the war that Garibaldi and his loyal men had waged for months.<\/p> <p>As Jesse White Mario observes in his 1889 supplement to the autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the dictator wrote several novels, including Clelia, Il Volontario (The Volunteer), and I Mille (The Thousand), hoping to earn enough money from their sales to support himself and his family. But the books were \u201cfailures from a literary or even a historical point of view.\u201d Indeed, Garibaldi himself replied to critics of his efforts that he himself was aware as much as anyone else of how worthless they were.<\/p> <p>Citing the hostility of Garibaldi\u2019s critics, Lucy Riall, author of Garibaldi: Invention of a Hero, agrees that the dictator\u2019s novels were not especially successful, noting that only Clelia \u201cwas published widely in translation.\u201d He struggled to find an Italian publisher for I Mille; his fourth novel, Manlio, was not published until 1982, long after the author\u2019s death.[2]<\/p> <p>8 Ludwik Mieroslawski<\/p> <p>January uprising of 1863 an armed struggle that shaped several generations of Poles (4)<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>According to Ohio University, Ludwik Mieroslawski (1814\u20131878) was twice a failure. Described as a \u201cPolish general, revolutionary activist, commander of revolutionary movements, and political writer,\u201d he left Poland for France after participating in the November Uprising of 1830\u20131831. There, his attempt to organize a Young France failed. He next tried his hand at writing, publishing \u201cseveral poems, historical dramas, and a novel,\u201d but these literary efforts proved unsuccessful.<\/p> <p>Returning to both Poland and politics, he supported a revolution in his homeland but was arrested by Prussian authorities, tried, and sentenced to death. He was released, however, when the Berlin revolution began. An additional arrest and release occurred, as did more failures to win against his military adversaries. Mieroslawski finally became a dictator during the 1863 January Uprising in Poland. He left Europe to go abroad, reestablishing the Polish Democratic Society and serving as its president until his \u201cdictatorial\u201d ways and the scandals he evoked led to his removal from office. Also, he was later ousted from the organization altogether. He died in \u201cpoverty and isolation.\u201d<\/p> <p>George J. Lerski\u2019s Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945, is kinder in its assessment of Mieroslawski\u2019s literary work than his critics\u2019 appraisals. The dictator\u2019s 1822 debut collection of poems, Ballads and Romances, \u201cconstituted a literary breakthrough [opening] the era of Romanticism in Poland,\u201d Lerski says, adding that Mieroslawski\u2019s literary interests encompassed a variety of themes and genres. These included, among others, \u201cForefathers\u2019 Eve\u201d (Dziady), \u201ca drama in verse\u201d based on Lithuanian folklore; his mystical Books of the Polish Nation and of the Polish Pilgrims, which constitutes \u201ca moral interpretation of the Polish history written in biblical prose\u201d; and his supreme accomplishment, Master Thaddeus (Pan Tadeusz), a sentimental \u201cnovel in verse\u201d completed in mid-1834.[3]<\/p> <p>7 Emperor Meiji<\/p> <p>History Summarized: The Meiji Restoration<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Emperor Meiji (1814\u20131878) became the King of Japan at age sixteen. Through astute political, diplomatic, and cultural actions, he ushered in \u201cthe most glorious and prosperous period of Japan\u2019s history\u201d to date. A child prodigy when it came to poetry, he penned his first verse at age eight. Over his lifetime, he wrote between 90,000 and 100,000 thirty-one-syllable waka poems, which alternate lines of five and seven morae (short syllables) and contain a final line of seven morae known as the poem\u2019s tanka.<\/p> <p>The topics of the emperor\u2019s poems are often conveyed by their titles; many celebrate nature. \u201cPine\u201d reads, \u201cIn a world of storms\/ Let there be no wavering\/ Of our human hearts;\/ Remain as the pine tree\/ With root sunk deep in ston[e].\u201d \u201cUniversal Brotherhood\u201d ends with a question: \u201cIt is our hope\/ That all the world\u2019s oceans\/ Be joined in peace,\/ So why do the winds and waves\/ Now rise up in angry rage?\u201d[4]<\/p> <p>6 Joseph Stalin<\/p> <p>The Private Life of Joseph Stalin (full documentary)<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>The name of Joseph Stalin (1878\u20131953) is not one that many would associate with the writing of poetry. Still, the Russian dictator was a poet during his days as a student at the Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis, Georgia. For a time, he even aspired to become a professional poet. Then, as Robert Service recounts in Stalin: A Biography, after becoming \u201calienated from the authorities,\u201d he seemed to lose interest in poetry, as he had in his academic studies. He chose not to join the Georgian cultural elite, preferring, instead, to pursue \u201chis studies of socialism, politics, and economics.\u201d His participation in the Tbilisi literary scene in 1895-6 was fleeting, and he no longer contributed his works, despite his \u201cpleasing style.\u201d<\/p> <p>His interest in poetry is all the more surprising, considering how he treated a celebrated Russian poet after coming to power. Unable to stomach the abuses of Stalinist oppression, Osip Emilievich Mandelstam penned but did not publish \u201ca derogatory poem about Stalin in 1933.\u201d It quickly spread through \u201cword of mouth,\u201d writes Helen Rappaport in Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion. A couple of lines made it clear how the poet felt about the dictator: Stalin, \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s mountaineer,\u201d hammered out laws that were \u201cflung\/ Like horseshoes at the head, the eye, or the groin.\u201d<\/p> <p>When Stalin learned of the unflattering poem, he had Mandelstam arrested; soon, the poet was exiled for three years. He was fortunate, Rappaport suggests: Stalin had not ordered him executed, perhaps because the dictator suspected that having the poet shot might be seen as \u201can act of petulant retaliation for a mere poem.\u201d Although Mandelstam later wrote an ode in praise of Stalin, \u201cperhaps not so much to save himself as to protect his wife,\u201d it seems that the poet had not learned his lesson, as he was arrested again after his exile ended. He returned to Moscow, where he commenced his anti-Soviet activities again. This time, he was sentenced to \u201cone of the harshest camps of the Gulag,\u201d where, in poor mental and physical health, he died within two months of his arrival.[5]<\/p> <p>5 Benito Mussolini<\/p> <p>Mussolini \u2013 Father of Fascism Documentary<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>An ally of Adolph Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (1883\u20131945) is most remembered as Italy\u2019s feared and hated fascist leader during World War II. The stony-faced, square-jawed tyrant, whose features, in some official portraits, seem carved of concrete, looks cold and unfeeling. At the time of his death by firing squad, Mussolini was so detested, even by his fellow Italians, that, after his execution, his body was hung upside down on a hook, alongside that of his slain mistress Clara Petacci. While El Duce (The Leader) hung by his heels, his remains were spat upon as the dictator was cursed, and an armed woman stepped forward from the crowd, firing five bullets into Mussolini\u2019s corpse, announcing that her deed was an act of vengeance \u201cfor my five dead sons.\u201d The New York Times expressed the judgment shared by millions throughout the world: the dictator\u2019s death was \u201ca fitting end to a wretched life.\u201d<\/p> <p>It is surprising, if not incredible, that a man such as Mussolini wrote a novel, an act usually considered to require not only some literary talent but also a measure of humanity and sensitivity. Of course, his 1910 Claudia Particella, l\u2019amante del Cardinale (The Cardinal\u2019s Mistress), was a far cry from most fictional narratives. As Mussolini 1883\u20131915: Triumph and Transformation of a Revolutionary Socialist, edited by Spencer M. Di Scalia and Emilito Gentile, observes, the dictator\u2019s volume was, by its author\u2019s own admission, a nasty book that he judged to be \u201cfit for seamstresses and scandal.\u201d Serialized before its publication in book form, the novel tells the story of two lovers in a \u201cstory of violence and shameful acts.\u201d Described as written in the \u201cstyle of [Alexander] Dumas,\u201d it was a huge success, not only in Italy but also throughout much of the world, \u201cbeing translated into at least ten languages.\u201d<\/p> <p>Although Mussolini served as Italy\u2019s prime minister from 1922\u20131943 and would not become El Duce until 1943, it may have been that, when he wrote his novel, he had not yet fully developed into the hated monster he would become as his nation\u2019s dictator. Perhaps he yet retained at least a modicum of the humanity and sensitivity needed to write a tawdry novel that would beguile people by delivering scandal, despite the growing inhumanity and brutality of the fascist wartime dictator.[6]<\/p> <p>4 Francisco Franco<\/p> <p>Franco \u2013 Spain\u2019s Nationalist Dictator Documentary<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Jaime de Andrade\u2019s 1942 novel Raz (Spirit of a Race) glorified \u201cthe principles of the Franco regime,\u201d writes Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow in their La Historia del Espa\u00f1ol (The History of Spanish). At the same time, the book depicted its opponents as losers. Despite the heavy-handed censorship of literary works in Franco\u2019s Spain, the book encountered no obstacles to its publication and easily obtained funds for a film adaptation. However, this turn of events is not as surprising as it might seem: Jaime de Andrade was the pen name of brutal Spanish dictator Francisco Franco (1892\u20131975), the true author of Raz.<\/p> <p>As Paul Preston points out in The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, as of 2012, \u201cGeneral Franco and his regime [continued] to enjoy a relatively good press [due to]\u2026persistent myths about the benefits of his rule.\u201d In reality, the author declares, both as a general and as Spain\u2019s dictator, Franco was a cruel leader who, in his war diary of 1922, lovingly described \u201cMoroccan villages destroyed and defenders decapitated.\u201d Extreme violence was used repeatedly to suppress free thought, freedom of speech, and armed resistance before, during, and long after the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939).<\/p> <p>According to Preston, Franco\u2019s tactics included carrying bloody heads as trophies, fixing decapitated heads to bayonets, leaving a \u201cColumn of Death\u201d from Seville to Madrid, implementing mass murder, using kangaroo courts; and conducting \u201ccleansing and punishment operations.\u201d Although deaths were often unregistered, it is estimated that Franco\u2019s campaign of terror resulted in between 130,199 and 150,000 fatalities. This was the true state of affairs in Franco\u2019s Spain, a truth never mentioned in the dictator\u2019s novel.[7]<\/p> <p>3 Mao Zedong<\/p> <p>Mao Zedong in 10 MINUTES<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Chinese dictator Mao Zedong (1883\u20131976) did not write novels. He wrote poetry. In most of his poems, the verses feature images from the natural world or allusions to autobiographical and historical events, which are often military in nature. \u201cYellow Crane Tower\u201d (1927) exemplifies the general technique of Zedong\u2019s poems. According to Jeremy Ingalls\u2019s Dragon in Ambush: The Art of War in the Poems of Mao Zedong, Zedong\u2019s poem employs \u201cwordplay associated with the theme of imperial rule.\u201d<\/p> <p>The poem reads, \u201cThrough far and wide the nine streams branch across the Middle Kingdom,\/ Far deeper now one track that runs from south to north is threading.\/ But under gray-green murk of rain-damp grime,\/ Tortoise and Snake still trap the major stream.\/ The Yellow Crane perhaps still knows the route?\/ Here still survives a traveler\u2019s resting site.\/ The wine I seize to pledge the torrent\u2019s roaring,\/ In my heart\u2019s tide that mounts, its own waves soaring.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to Dragon in Ambush\u2019s interpretation of Zedong\u2019s poem, the nine streams created by the emperor Yu are contrasted with the even deeper track to the north that Zedong intends to cut as he and his army travel toward the Yangtze River, \u201cthe major stream\u201d that must be \u201ccrossed\u201d so that his forces can gain control of China.<\/p> <p>The question that the speaker of the poem (Zedong himself) asks about the Yellow Crane expresses his confidence that he will not only cross the river and conquer China but that he shall also enjoy immortality as a conquering godlike figure, thanks to \u201cthe leverage provided by the crane, the supernatural bird commemorated at the site of the Yellow Crane Tower.\u201d To many, this vision may seem odd. Still, it accords with Zedong\u2019s own world view that the successful \u201cdominant world-commander\u2026who [can]\u2026manipulate the\u2026processes of nature and human nature\u201d achieves an apotheosis of sorts, becoming \u201chimself the \u2018Heaven\u2019 to which all human beings\u2026are regarded as inevitable subjects.\u201d[8]<\/p> <p>2 Mohammad Raza Pahlavi<\/p> <p>Last Persian Shah \u2013 Full Movie<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Mohammad Raza Pahlavi (1919-1980) was the Shah of Iran from 1941 to 1979, when the monarchy was abolished, and Ayatollah Khomeini (1900-1989) became the supreme leader for the next decade. As Abbas Milani points out in The Shah, his biography of Pahlavi, the future head of state was introduced to poetry by his constant companion, Ernest Perron, whom Pahlavi met as a student at Institut Le Rosey, a Swiss boarding school. Although Pahlavi never published any poetry, author Jon Ingvar Kjaran states that the young shah wrote some verses of his own while visiting with Perron, with whom Pahlavi also discussed poetry.<\/p> <p>As an article in The Guardian points out, despite Pahlavi\u2019s early fondness for poetry, the future Shah of Iran became a dictator who ran a brutally repressive regime, \u201cenforced by the notorious Savak secret police.\u201d His brutality and the corruption of his autocratic rule did not sit well with the Iranian people. When Pahlavi came into political conflict with his nation\u2019s prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq, and \u201cwas forced to flee the country,\u201d Pahlavi relocated several times, moving to Mexico, the United States, Panama, and Egypt, where he died in July 1980.[9]<\/p> <p>1 Saddam Hussein<\/p> <p>CIA Interrogator: At Time of U.S. Invasion, Saddam Hussein Was Focused on Writing Novel, Not WMDs<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>As the president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein (1937\u20132006) was a brutal dictator. His cruelty is evident in the sites of mass graves across the country that he ruled with an iron fist. The Iraqi people themselves testified to the atrocities to which their relatives were subjected. According to The White House website, Iraqi citizens were beaten, tortured, executed by dynamite, gassed, raped, shocked, attacked by dogs and lions, and subjected to medical experiments. In one case, an infant\u2019s eye was gouged out before her skull was crushed by her being thrown against a wall. At Hussein\u2019s son Uday\u2019s direction, Olympic athletes were humiliated by being \u201csmeared with feces and jailed or placed inside [sarcophagi] with nails pointed inward so they would be punctured and suffocated.\u201d<\/p> <p>The same barbaric dictator wrote both poetry and four novels, including Zabibah and the King, an allegorical love story. In fact, a U.S. government translator not only read but also studied Hussein\u2019s book. As a result, the CIA concluded that, although Hussein himself probably didn\u2019t actually pen the novel\u2019s words, he had \u201ccarefully supervised its production and suffused it with his own words and ideas.\u201d The U.S. government\u2019s summary of the novel states that \u201cSaddam\u2019s style, sentence structure, and expressions are clearly present in the novel.\u201d In other words, it seems that, although Zabibah and the King was largely ghost-written, it contains a good deal of Hussein\u2019s own personal input. Writing for The New York Times, Elaine Sciolino states that, amid the volume\u2019s \u201crambling, overheated prose,\u201d U.S. officials found \u201can intriguing window into Mr. Hussein\u2019s thinking.\u201d<\/p> <p>Set in the ancient world, the narrative is a love story featuring a powerful king (a stand-in for Hussein himself) and Zabibah, a beautiful villager who represents the people of Iraq. The king tells his beloved that he is a great leader who must be both obeyed and loved. In the process of the lengthy exchanges of dialogue between the lovers, the king shares his views on \u201cGod, politics, love, family, loyalty, betrayal and the will of the people\u201d as well as his own \u201cinsecurities.\u201d<\/p> <p>The otherwise tender romance also includes a scene in which Zabibah is raped, \u201can obvious reference to the United States invasion of Iraq at the end of the Persian Gulf war,\u201d Sciolino remarks, although U.S. officials interpreted the scene as Hussein\u2019s take on what he saw as \u201cIsrael\u2019s treatment of Palestinians.\u201d The novel ends with the deaths of both Zabibah and the king on January 17th, the same day that the United States-led coalition began bombing Baghdad as part of the war to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. The lovers\u2019 bodies are buried side by side \u201cso that the people can throw stones on his grave to desecrate it on the anniversary of his death.\u201d<\/p> <p>In addition to Zabibah and the King, Hussein wrote The Fortified Castle (2001), Men and the City (2002), and Bygone Demons (2006).[10]<\/p> <p>fact checked by Darci Heikkinen<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3AJA9FLWSEDYZNJDPOVCU2CFCJRIFM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":654,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1933.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Soviet Union","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Osip Emilievich Mandelstam","victim_keywords":"Russian poet, Stalin, exiled","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Moroccan citizens, killed, decapitation, burned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Iraqi citizens, toture, muder, rape, experimentation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1933.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Soviet Union","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Osip Emilievich Mandelstam","victim_keywords":"Russian poet, Stalin, exiled","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Moroccan citizens, killed, decapitation, burned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Iraqi citizens, toture, muder, rape, experimentation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":899260374,"Input.title":"MEPs: Don't waste your chance to change Vietnam","Input.publish_date":"2020-01-15 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>EU Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom, front left, and Vietnamese Trade Minister Tran Tuan Anh, front right, stand together as they exchange documents aftering signing a free trade agreement in Hanoi, June 30, 2019.<\/p> <p>In coming weeks, the European Parliament is expected to take a binding decision on whether to approve, postpone or reject the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Investment Protection Agreement (IPA).<\/p> <p>The votes come after a long, troubled path, whose end might not be in sight.<\/p> <p>Negotiations between the Commission and the Vietnamese government went from 2012 to June 2019.<\/p> <p>During this time, Vietnam has been engaged in a brutal crackdown on dissent and organised labour, especially since 2016.

When Sunitha Krishnan, co-founder of Prajwala, went to meet a child featured in it, she expected a scared, silent, suspicious person. Instead, she found a cherubic 12-year-old girl, bursting with enthusiasm. Praniti (name changed) was no problem child. She attended school, was polite and never begged for chips or soda. She would chat with a close friend online, someone her parents assumed was from school. Nothing prepared them for the discovery that the person was a stranger and that sexually explicit photographs of their daughter were all over the internet. Praniti's reaction was different. There was only denial. \"She was adamant this person was her friend, that she had done nothing wrong,\" says Krishnan. The biggest threat in children being 'groomed' through the internet is the complete transfer of trust from the prey to the predator. It destroys the construct of victimhood in a child's mind. \"The child doesn't know he or she is being exploited. Imagine a childhood spent grappling with the notion of betrayal and abuse,\" says Krishnan.<\/p> <p>Cyber grooming of the very young, like Praniti, is the newest threat in a booming online child pornography market that has reached alarming proportions in India (see Perverse Patterns). According to the US-based National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), India now accounts for the maximum number of online child sexual abuse imagery in the world, followed by Thailand. NCMEC estimates that Indian users have uploaded 25,000 images or videos in just the past five months. Delhi tops the list for the maximum uploads of child porn, followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. \"Innovation and the internet come with their own set of challenges, some of which are alarming as in child pornography,\" says Dr Gulshan Rai, chief information security officer in the prime minister's office. \"The IT Act bans the viewing, creation and distribution of child pornography in the country, but it still happens. Moreover, intermediaries like social networks are not removing such content fast enough. They are not owning up to their responsibility towards society, focusing instead on revenue and maximum visibility.\"<\/p> <p>Indian users have uploaded 25,000 images or videos in just the past five months. Delhi tops the list.<\/p> <p>Anyonea family member, criminal racket or cyber strangercan create child porn. They need not be paedophiles. \"We are seeing an increase in self-generated child porn,\" says Sidd-harth Pillai, co-founder of Aarambh, which runs a helpline for reporting child porn. Government figures also show that circulation of child porn is on the rise. Last year, 377 websites were blocked in India for posting child porn content. According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, 781 cases of creating or storing child porn were recorded in 2018. In 2017, it had been 331 cases. Odisha had the maximum number of such cases (333) in 2018, as opposed to only eight in 2017. \"Much of child abuse footage is filmed inside homes by known relatives or family friends. This could happen anywhereurban, rural, poor, rich. There would also be an offline apparatus where victims of sex trafficking could be filmed,\" says Pillai.<\/p> <p>Source: The latest transparency reports of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram<\/p> <p>Reports show that approximately 100 people have been arrested or summoned for viewing and distributing child porn across the country since November 2019. Additionally, Gujarat's Crime Investigation Department received names of 62 paedophiles in the same month. In October 2019, the CBI filed cases against seven Indians involved in an international child sex racket. What is not mentioned is whether these same people also create content. According to the NCRB, one child is sexually abused every 15 minutes in India. While there is no single figure for how much of this happens within homes, those working with victims and several independent studies estimate that 70-90 per cent of all child abuse is perpetrated by people known to the child. \"Often couples or child abusers film their acts, and this content gets leaked. There is also grave concern over children being groomed to participate in sexual activities through social media friends,\" says Pillai. Child sex abuse is not just traumatic in a person's formative years, it creates a cycle of abuse. According to a 2008 study in the International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 'pathological family atmosphere with precocious exposures to sexual behaviours and sexual acts, traumatic sexual experiences in childhood, sexual interests and exploration, deprivation and failure in romantic relationships, and young boys who have been coerced into homosexual acts, are at increased risk of becoming young sexual offenders.'<\/p> <p>There are also reports of an offline, unorganised child porn industry, perhaps a subset of the larger organised porn industry in India. \"Sexual abuse also exists where trafficking does,\" says Krishnan. One can assume child sexual imagery could be beginning in areas that are hubs of trafficking-West Bengal, Rajasthan, Maharasthra being the top three, shows NCRB data.<\/p> <p>Alarmed by the reports, Rajya Sabha chairman and vice-president Venkaiah Naidu set up a committee under the leadership of the Congress's Jairam Ramesh in December 2019. The 14-member committee met with social media firms and representatives from the women and child development, electronics & IT and home affairs ministries to discuss two key issues: children accessing pornographic material and the circulation of child porn. Around 40 recommendations were submitted in the final report last month. At present, instances of child porn are not reported to a governing body or recorded and made public by social media companies, a practice the same firms follow in the US. The US also has cyber crime teams that monitor and track down child porn creators based on these reports. The Rajya Sabha report has recommended that a central body be set up to whom online platforms can report IP addresses of those searching for child porn. While the panel did consider several legislative, technological and institutional measures for those viewing and promoting child porn, it did not include how content creators or those advocating sexual activities to children online will be tracked. The menace is largely to be dealt with on visible circulation channels. And while digital safety education was recommended, nothing was mentioned on sex education for children to be more aware of their bodies and rights. The report's impact on lawmakers and subsequent implementation of the recommendations remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>While the electronics & IT ministry had earlier recommended that automated tools weed out terrorism and child porn, it is likely that the final draft of the guidelines for IT intermediaries will mandate only child porn be monitored and removed. The final call on revised guidelines is expected in the next few weeks.<\/p> <p>Among the people the committee consulted and who also helped draft the final report was Amol Deshmukh of research outfit Herd Foundation. \"Online exploitation of children is a major concern,\" he says. \"We have recommended that cyber grooming, advocating or counselling sexual activities with a person under 18, be made an offence under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. We also discussed setting up a cyber-crime investigative agency in India, especially to monitor the dark web, where a major chunk of child porn is viewed.\" However, monitoring of online criminal marketplaces, like the dark web, did not make it to the final Rajya Sabha report.<\/p> <p>The dark web<\/p> <p>Social media giants are beginning to act against child pornography in India. In February 2019, the company website stated that 'over the last three months, WhatsApp has banned approximately 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery'. YouTube removed 851,441 videos citing child safety concerns between July and September 2019. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, too, removed millions of such images and videos last year. However, this is just the trackable surface web. What is available on the dark web can never be fully documented. Playpen, a dark website the FBI shut down in 2015, had 215,000 users and 23,000 sexually explicit images of children, even toddlers.<\/p> <p>India is currently among the top 10 countries logging on to the dark web, according to metrics released by the TOR Project, an open-source software for enabling anonymous communication (50,000 Indians logged on daily as of January 2020). Figures can fluctuate depending on how people access the network, and how they cover their tracks. In 2014, the figure was over 200,000 a day for India. According to Hyderabad-based ethical hacker Bharat Rao, \"It is now very simple for people to hide their location, thanks to online tutorials and virtual private networks. This makes it harder to track actual user numbers. I don't think the figures since 2014 have reduced, people are just accessing the dark web differently and more covertly.\"<\/p> <p>Tracking a single user on the dark web can take 3-4 months. For websites, much more.<\/p> <p>Unlike the surface web, where websites are indexed on search engines, the dark web helps sites achieve total anonymity. Software like TOR directs internet traffic through hundreds of virtual tunnels. These tunnels are created between nodes (or relays). Each time data is transmitted, a random route is picked between these nodes. TOR also goes a step further and deploys the 'onion routing' of data. Imagine driving from Delhi to Jaipur-instead of taking the direct NH-48, you drive through a number of other towns and cities to reach it. None of the cities will know which other city you visited except the one before and after it. And each time you go, you take a different route. This is essentially how a user connects to the deep web; the convoluted, hidden route maintains blanket secrecy.<\/p> <p>A user can access the dark web very simply. All one has to do is download a TOR browser (available as an app on smartphones and downloadable on desktops), and connect. On the deep web, there is no Google. Instead, you have search engines like The Hidden Wiki, Duck Duck Go and TOR Links. These will not show you any results for child porn, which is 'officially' banned just as on the surface web, complying with the guidelines of the offline world. However, logging on to specialised encrypted search engines like Onion Land and Onion Dir takes you to a different world. On Onion Land alone, a search for 'child porn' throws up over 130 website links, and a search for 'child porn India' around 50. There are websites which sell children as slaves, host videos of child torture, images of children with aggressive animals and of children taking nude selfies. A search for 'nude child Indian' on Onion Land reveals 42 links, and one listed images by caste, state, colour, gender and age.<\/p> <p>Rather than names, websites on the dark web are a random alphanumeric sequence strung together with the domain name '.onion'. For example, a link describing 'india child stripping to bra' was 'jnsbixyz32lsex82nm.onion'. Transactions to access such content are made in Bitcoin. On jnsbixyz32lsex82nm.onion, the price to view five images was about Rs 6,000 in Bitcoin. To gauge the popularity and cost-effectiveness of these links, you only have to visit the various crowdfunding platforms for child porn. One website-uh3xkebozq5n6ygv.onion (listed on a Reddit forum)-lets you view images and videos only after 500 users have paid around Rs 800 in Bitcoin.<\/p> <p>The centre has banned child porn, but is yet to set up a dedicated agency to investigate cases.<\/p> <p>Content is also sold on the hundreds of marketplaces of the deep web. Popular ones include Empire, Berlusconi, Cave to R, Black Mart, Dream and Elite. Most of the products on sale here are drugs or weapons. All marketplaces have the disclaimer that selling child porn is banned. And it is indeed not a product for transaction, until you start a chat. Encrypted, chats are where cyber groomers peddle content. On Elite, a buyer for static images quoted the following rates: 'Child Front: Rs 4,000\/ Child Back: Rs 6,000' (rupee equivalents of Bitcoin). More can be offered for videos, children with objects, children with other children, or children with adults. These chat rooms are heavily monitored-even something as inconspicuous as taking a screenshot of a conversation can trigger off an alert, and instant blocking out.<\/p> <p>Currently, India does not have the resources to crack down on such operations. \"The dark web cannot be regulated and it will require a full-fledged investigative agency to even try. At present, we don't even have one for the surface web,\" says Mukesh Choudhary, a cyber crime expert who has trained close to 5,000 armed forces officials and police in India on cyber crime investigations. \"Hunting for users through the dark web is very hard,\" he adds. \"Websites change links, people hide locations, routes of data transfer are hidden and different each time.\" Rai makes a similar point: \"The dark web is extremely time-consuming to regulate. At times, it can be impossible.\" Tracking a single user on the dark web can take 3-4 months; tracking a website even more. A US-South Korea crackdown on a child porn dark website called Welcome to Video took over two years. Transactions in cryptocurrency, onion routing, encrypted chats and Protonmail (which also cannot be tracked) are the biggest hurdles for dark web investigators.<\/p> <p>The road ahead<\/p> <p>Various stakeholders are involved in child protection, each playing a different role. Social media platforms are clear there is zero tolerance for any kind of child abuse. A Twitter India spokesperson says, \"We have been at the forefront of responding to the challenge of preventing the exploitation of children on the internet and will continue to fight online child sexual abuse and invest in essential technology and tools.\" What these tools are, the company is unwilling to divulge.<\/p> <p>ShareChat, however, is open to sharing that they use artificial intelligence (AI) to detect child porn. \"AI tools usually detect skin or movement. Some videos have only audio, or the bottom half will be cut off to trick the AI,\" admits Berges Malu, public policy head at ShareChat. A similar problem with AI has been detected on Facebook too. Krishnan tried to report a group called Kochu Sundarikal (Little Pretty One), an English-Malayalam community of 3,000 paedophiles openly discussing child abuse. The AI could not spot a 'community guideline violation' because it was in a vernacular language. Similarly, Ankit Mitra (name changed), 31, a cyber hacker from Ahmedabad, says he recently helped bust a WhatsApp group called Bhabiji ghar pe hai, where 150 paedophiles shared images and links to child porn on the dark web. Despite consultations with social media companies, the government has not mandated accountability or punitive measures for failure to remove or report content.<\/p> <p>The government has banned child porn but is yet to set up a dedicated agency to investigate cases of those who view, distribute and create it. There is a general consensus on the ineffectiveness of moral bans. \"Generally, harm reduction is a more successful approach because even if pornography is banned, people are likely to continue watching (as they have for centuries). Typically, a ban does not stop use, it just moves use into the shadows and stigmatises the behaviour, which is antithetical to the goal of decreasing negative health effects,\" says Kimberly M. Nelson, professor, Boston University, and co-author of the study, 'Pornography is not a public health crisis'. Public shaming or humiliation is often used as a deterrent for crime in China and some American states. Psychiatrists, behaviouralists and even judges are divided on whether this is an effective form of discipline, though it's viewed as a stronger message than moral policing. The justice system, however, needs to be speedy and robust for such punishments to have an impact.<\/p> <p>Experts recommend sex education, so that children know their bodies-and their rights.<\/p> <p>A blind eye is being turned towards sexual education, even though academics argue for its benefits in deterring child abuse. \"Children need to be educated about sex. If they know about their bodies, they knows about their rights,\" says S.K. Khandelwal, head of psychiatry, AIIMS, Delhi. Chennai-based sexologist Prakash Kothari, who has been practising for 48 years, thinks likewise. \"I have seen the age of puberty speed up from 14 years to 11 now. This is largely because of exposure to sexual content through movies, news, songs, social media, chatrooms etc. However, the mind still matures at age 21. This is why it is imperative for schools to educate children about their bodies, to help them understand exploitation,\" says Kothari.<\/p> <p>Arun Kapur, director of Delhi's Vasant Valley School, says, \"Parents need to be parents, not friends. Discipline and awareness about digital safety begins at home. There is only so much schools can do. Most children today are on phones even before they start school,\" says Kapur. Indeed, parents are the first responders here. In the UK, Papaya Parents, a collective of concerned parents who wish to battle phone, porn and internet addiction among their kids, advises being involved with children, having open discussions and clear guidelines on usage. Many also access their kids' social media accounts, and will monitor it till they turn 18. India has no such support group.<\/p> <p>Despite media scrutiny and suggestions for stricter legal measures, creation of, and access to, child pornography has never been simpler. In 1991, when Freddy Peats was arrested for sexually exploiting children at his Goa orphanage, the police discovered 2,305 porn photographs of minor boys engaged in sexual acts with white men and 135 film negatives of child porn in his possession. What took Peats 20 years to achieve can now be done in a few weeks. A search on a dark website reveals 300,000 images of children being forced to engage in sexual acts with other children, children being tortured by adults, being bitten by animals and nude selfies of young schoolgirls and boys. This is the threat of the internet, where the hunter and the hunted exist on the same platform with nothing to distinguish one from the other. With close to 66 million children from India scouring the web every day (according to a 2019 study by the Internet and Mobile Association of India), each one is at risk of becoming a silent victim in an advancing pornography market.<\/p> <p>Perverse patterns<\/p> <p>Child predators often spend weeks building connections with their victims, normalising the watching of porn before manipulating them into making such material themselves<\/p> <p>The cyber grooming of children by predators-the befriending of children online with the explicit intention of later sexual exploitation-is spreading with alarming rapidity in India. And what often goes largely unreported in India is the evolving modus operandi of such predators.<\/p> <p>\"The victims are those who are 'struggling' in some way,\" says Shelja Sen, child psychologist and family therapist. \"They could be lonely, failing in academics, dealing with parental strife, born with a disability, isolated from others their age... these are the kids who are singled out and approached.\" Through a process that involves stalking their victims on social media and spinning a compelling narrative as bait, cyber groomers appear to rely heavily on gaming forums and chatrooms to develop emotional connections with their victims. \"They don't care if the child is rich or poor, urban or rural, male or female. They will look for signs [of vulnerability], such as posts about loneliness or weight issues or health conditions-anything that suggests the child is alienated and craves social connection,\" explains Sunitha Krishnan, co-founder of Prajwala.<\/p> <p>70 per cent of boys in Grade 9 watched 6 porn videos a week on average, according to one estimate.<\/p> <p>This was clearly visible in the case of 14-year-old Heena (name changed). Heena, a student from Lucknow, had often disclosed to other players on Fortnite (an online video game that has a chat window where players can text each other) how miserable she was because her parents were getting a divorce. It was here that an online predator-'Mudita'-found her.<\/p> <p>Illustration by Nilanjan Das<\/p> <p>Mudita later approached Heena on Facebook, and over the weeks that followed, manipulated her into believing they had a great deal in common. Mudita would post about her own parents getting a divorce, and after she found out that Heena enjoyed street food, also began posting photos of chhole bhature, golgappas and kebabs. She was so successful in the deception that it was Heena who messaged her, offering words of comfort. Later, when Mudita introduced her to pornography, Heena accepted it as normal because 'her friend' had shown it to her-a trust that remained unbroken even when Mudita asked Heena to film herself naked. It was only when Heena's mother chanced upon the messages that the dangerous 'friendship' came to light.<\/p> <p>It was Mudita's Facebook account that gave Manoj Sharma-psychiatrist and founder of NIMHANS's social media de-addiction centre in Bengaluru-a look at how much deliberation predators put into their efforts. \"Of the 8-10 children we see per week, invariably, several have been led to watch porn online,\" says Sharma. \"Typically, they are conditioned to porn from an early age-they find nudity to be no big deal. So it doesn't feel exploitative to them [if they were to be] filmed in the same manner,\" says Sharma. \"Everything is available online and can also easily be hidden.

Get your tickets now!<\/p> <p>Taika Waititi\u2019s films take place in worlds where the heightened and the everyday are one and the same. In What We Do in the Shadows, Vampires (as well as werewolves and other varieties of supernatural folk) exist. They\u2019re as likely to quarrel over whose turn it is to do dishes as they are to brawl over one of their number cluelessly alerting an amateur vampire hunter. In Hunt for the Wilderpeople, a would-be-tough teenager and his surly adoptive uncle flee into the New Zealand bush to escape from the government. The development of their relationship is as important to their survival as is evading their increasingly relentless pursuers. In Thor: Ragnarok, the Norse god of thunder\u2019s long-lost sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) returns from exile, vowing to conquer existence. Thor coming to terms with his late father Odin (Anthony Hopkins)\u2019s failings and his own doubts is vital to stopping her \u2013 even more than learning to wield his powers to their fullest extent. The worlds Waititi spins and the tales he tells are gloriously zonked and frequently hilarious. Simultaneously they\u2019re insightful, thoughtful studies of humanity. Furthermore, Waititi depicts evil as something intensely dweeby. Waititi\u2019s villains, even Blanchett\u2019s fairly stern Hela, are lost in their own worlds. They\u2019re clueless and more than a bit absurd. It\u2019s funny. And, once the laughter subsides, a fairly astute observation on the nature of wickedness.<\/p> <p>What We Do in the Shadows\u2019 vampire flatmates are the picture\u2019s protagonists but, lovable though they are, they\u2019re all at least a little bit evil. They kill casually \u2013 one memorable argument between Waititi\u2019s Viago and Jemaine Clement\u2019s Vladislav turns on the latter ruining the former\u2019s antique couch by getting blood all over it. Viago is far more upset about his furniture than he is some poor schmuck getting gnawed on. Yes, drinking blood comes with the vampire package, but the disregard with which they treat their victims stands out given that they can and do care about people \u2013 charmingly milquetoast software developer Stu (Stu Rutherford) for instance, or Viago\u2019s beloved Katherine (Ethel Robinson). But, when it comes time for a snack someone they don\u2019t care about might as well be a sandwich \u2013 ideally a sandwich that no one has had sex with. Beyond their frequent murders, the flatmates can be impressively oblivious to anyone\u2019s needs other than their own. Case in point, Vladislav describes his infamous history as a torturer as a sign that \u201cI was in a bad place.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hunt for the Wilderpeople\u2019s overzealous child services worker Paula (Rachel House) does not murder people willy-nilly. But her contempt for a boy she\u2019s supposed to be protecting and her obsession with being an action hero reveal her morality to be severely warped all the same. Wilderpeople\u2019s young hero Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) has had a rough go. He\u2019s built up a hard-edged shell to protect himself and done his fair share of acting out. Paula sees Ricky only as \u201ca real bad egg.\u201d She speaks of his assorted misdemeanors as though they were the crimes of a master criminal. And when Ricky takes off into the bush rather than return to the foster system after his adoptive Aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata)\u2019s death, Paula goes to war. She continually escalates her conflict with Ricky until she\u2019s riding an armored personnel carrier and commanding a fleet of police and hunters in pursuit of the boy and his adoptive Uncle Hec (Sam Neill). As Wilderpeople progresses, Paula comes to view her pursuit of Ricky and Hec as a grand battle, one in which she\u2019s the crusading hero:<\/p> <p>Never mind that Paula\u2019s supposed to be the one advocating for Ricky. Never mind that New Zealand child services are in no way equivalent to the movie version of American police. Never mind that the level of force she ultimately brings to bear in her hunt for Ricky is so disproportionate that it crosses into the realm of the absurd. Paula\u2019s the hero. At best, Ricky is an object to be retrieved. At worst, he\u2019s her villain.<\/p> <p>Thor: Ragnarok\u2019s two primary villains \u2013 Blanchett\u2019s Hela and Jeff Goldblum\u2019s Grandmaster, operate at both macro and micro levels of wickedness. Hela\u2019s grand speeches and plots of universal conquest coexist alongside her pettily abusive behavior to her younger brothers Thor and Loki. The Grandmaster\u2019s thinly painted-on affability and oozing sleaze coexist alongside his breathtaking cruelty and masterminding of a culture that has put him on top of everyone else. While their motivations and personalities are starkly different from one another, both Hela and the Grandmaster display an unsettling, almost childish drive to be the most important person in the world. Grandmaster constantly needs to burnish his own self-image \u2013 whether through emphasizing that the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is his gladiatorial champion or trying to claim credit for the revolution that rose up to overthrow him. Hela is less openly needy in her pursuit of power and recognition. But her confrontations with Loki and Thor consistently see her try to belittle and bully them. She conflates their very existence with Odin\u2019s decision to erase her (and Asgard\u2019s time as an actively imperial power) from history \u2013 one of many moral failures on his part, but one his sons are in no way responsible for. It is not enough for Hela to overthrow her brothers and return Asgard to its warmongering days. No, she aims to repay her father\u2019s insult by breaking his other children \u2013 as if by maiming and mocking Thor she will affirm her own might. It\u2019s telling that, during their climactic battle, Hela aims to humiliate Thor first and kill him second \u2013 still trying to make the same point to him she had already made when she shattered Mjolnir.<\/p> <p>Evil, in Taika Waititi\u2019s films, is both fundamentally ridiculous and fundamentally blinkered. His heroes may be eccentric goofballs themselves, but they possess an awareness of the world and an emotional intelligence that enables them to grow and change. Ricky Baker, Hec, Thor and even What We Do in the Shadows\u2019 evil-but-capable-of-empathy vampires are changed by their experiences. Paula, Grandmaster and Hela remain static \u2013 too caught up in their obsessions and foibles to do anything but charge forwards and demand the world change to suit their desires. They pay no mind to other people because other people aren\u2019t a part of their worlds beyond the most superficial level. They\u2019re hilarious. They\u2019re dreadful. They\u2019re malignant dweebs. And, when setting aside the heightened nature of their actions, they\u2019re a sharp study of how pathetic that sort of cruelty and viciousness truly is.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3IKMEYR0LYA54OXP1W1HNZX3VJC2KY"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":667,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Movie, films, review, actors, actress","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Movie, films, review, actors, actress","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1007665834,"Input.title":"Marcos called out by 1Sambayan: \u2018Stop lies, historical distortions\u2019","Input.publish_date":"2021-10-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Opposition coalition 1Sambayan on Tuesday, Oct. 5, called out former Senator Bongbong Marcos, the son of the late President Ferdinand Marcos and who announced his presidential bid, to stop distorting the truth about the dark days of his family\u2019s Martial Law era.<\/p> <p>1Sambayan (Photo courtesy of Neri Colmenares)<\/p> <p>Marcos announced his candidacy for president in the 2022 polls, 35 years after his family left the country in the throes of a people-backed military revolt that ended his father\u2019s almost 21 years in power.<\/p> <p>\u201cStop the lies and stop the historical distortions, Bongbong!

When police arrested the suspects involved in the incident, they discovered that the two were holding fake IDs.<\/p> <p>Although POGOs contribute to the local economy, some legislators are now asking whether the taxes earned are sufficient enough reason to overlook the stories coming out about the industry.<\/p> <p>Senators Richard Gordon and Franklin Drilon questioned members of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) about the benefits of POGO operations. They pointed out that POGOs generate a total net inflow of P7 billion ($140 million) but this revenue translates to a \u201cnegligible\u201d 0.04% of the Philippines\u2019 total domestic economy.<\/p> <p>Drilon was outraged when Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) regulators, the agency responsible for supervising the POGO, claimed that offshore gambling was still beneficial to the country.<\/p> <p>\u201cI am disappointed at the statement of PAGCOR saying [they] are in favor of POGO continuing in our shores because of the income we earn \u2014 such a short-ranged statement,\u201d Sen. Drilon explained during a heated point in the hearing where he called the mentality of PAGCOR representatives \u201cstupid.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThe social problems they have brought in our country are not worth the regulation fees that you earn,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy are we so in love with POGOs?\u201d<\/p> <p>Several senators, including Joel Villanueva and Risa Hontiveros, have demanded a more thorough investigation of the POGO operations, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has suggested he\u2019d be willing to shut down the operations altogether if the industry\u2019s problems continue.

The girls were taken by their captors from the Government Girls Secondary School in the town of Jangebe and marched into the forest at gunpoint. The kidnappers had entered Jangebe with an explosion of gunfire, scaring off residents while conducting the abduction and killing a police officer in the process. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, are increasingly using mass kidnappings in attempts to extort ransom and are the expected culprit. A heavily armed search and rescue operation ensued, with both ground and aerial units deployed, and the kidnapped girls have since been released. This event is the latest in a string of kidnappings of schoolchildren in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Among others, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres denounced the kidnapping. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari also condemned the action, calling it \u201cinhumane,\u201d according to the BBC. Buhari has gone on record stating that his administration will not give in to blackmail by groups that target innocent school children. Despite his repeated condemnations, however, many have criticized his government\u2019s continued inability to prevent these incidents. Although authorities deny any negotiation with militants, a variety of armed groups have been conducting more and more mass kidnappings for ransom. That the mass abduction of children is seen as a way to secure payment is evidenced by the increased targeting of schoolchildren.<\/p> <p>The kidnapping in Zamfara state was Nigeria\u2019s second mass abduction of schoolchildren in under two weeks. Nine days prior, 42 people, including 27 students, were kidnapped in Niger state in north-central Nigeria and one student was killed in the process. Only a few months ago, in December 2020, more than 300 schoolboys were kidnapped by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the northern state of Katsina. The boys were rescued by security forces and the 27 recently kidnapped students were released a day after the Zamfara abduction.<\/p> <p>Overall, security in northern Nigeria has been worsened by the heightened activity of armed groups, including the increased frequency of mass abductions. Kidnappings such as these have become especially common in the region, making families extremely fearful for the safety of their children in schools. Boko Haram has been widely acknowledged to carry out school kidnappings, including the example of the 276 girls abducted from Chibok in 2014, which captured worldwide attention. However, the practice has been increasingly adopted by other militant groups, conveying a worrying trend. According to Al Jazeera, in Zamfara state, abductions for ransom and village raids by gunmen are a regular occurrence.<\/p> <p>Not only do these attacks risk the lives of children but, even if returned, their quality of life may be forever affected. Kidnappings put children at risk of never returning to school out of fear that school is too dangerous. The three mass abductions since December are a worrying sign for the safety of schoolchildren and for the region\u2019s security, leading to many calls on the state and federal governments to make repressing armed groups and ensuring the safety of children in schools a top priority.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3GVPRXWRPJ9LKU4775X06AZYEV97I8"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1037,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":"26.0","city":"None","region":"Zamfara","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"girls, kidnappings, police officer, school","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":"26.0","city":"None","region":"Zamfara","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"girls, kidnappings, police officer, school","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":987125429,"Input.title":"Hyundai and Renault-Nissan forced to shut Indian plants due to worker unrest over lack of COVID-19 protections","Input.publish_date":"2021-05-27 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>After rank-and-file workers staged a sit-down strike Monday to protest the lack of COVID-19 protections, management at a Hyundai Motors plant in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu announced a five-day suspension of operations, starting Tuesday. The autoworkers were protesting the dangerous working conditions at the plant, where 150 are currently being treated for COVID-19 symptoms, according to a union official. Ten Hyundai Motors India workers have already perished from the virus.<\/p> <p>Five thousand workers at Renault-Nissan\u2019s car plant, also located in the Sriperumbudur-Oragaram industrial belt, were set to follow the example of their Hyundai colleagues by walking off the job Wednesday. At least five Renault-Nissan workers have lost their lives to the virus. Well aware that social tensions are at the boiling point and that the protest movement could spread like wildfire, Renault-Nissan management subverted the job action by announcing a five-day suspension of plant operations until May 30.<\/p> <p>Renault Nissan Automotive India workers (Credit: global.nissannews.com)<\/p> <p>The Renault-Nissan workers said that their demands for COVID-19 protections had been ignored. CNBC TV18 reported that the workers\u2019 main complaints are a lack of medical insurance, management\u2019s insistence on running the plant at full capacity\u2014making social distancing impossible\u2014and cramped canteens.<\/p> <p>Prior to the shutdown, Renault-Nissan had demanded that workers maintain a backbreaking pace of 27 jobs per hour on line 1 and 40 jobs per hour on line 2. With 95 percent of the workers 40 and younger yet to be vaccinated, management\u2019s decision to keep the factory operating at full tilt has allowed the virus to run rampant through the plant.<\/p> <p>The Tamil Nadu autoworkers\u2019 job action underscores that it is the global working class that is the main source of opposition to the ruling elite\u2019s criminal \u201copen economy\u201d policy, which prioritizes capitalist profit over saving workers\u2019 lives. In spring 2020, autoworkers in Canada and the United States, and other industrial workers in Italy and Spain, carried out work stoppages in open rebellion against the corporatist trade unions, which, like the employers, were desperate to keep production running. These job actions saved countless thousands of lives, forcing the ruling elites in North America and Europe to impose temporary shutdowns that they otherwise had no intention of ever implementing.<\/p> <p>Likewise, the eruption of working-class anger over the callous indifference displayed by the Indian ruling elite towards workers\u2019 lives testifies to the deep and widespread opposition to the \u201cprofits before lives\u201d response to COVID-19 pursued by the Indian government at all levels. India is currently the world epicentre of the pandemic, with well over 4,000 official daily deaths now being recorded. The true depth of the crisis is far worse, with credible estimates suggesting that tens of thousands are dying every day.<\/p> <p>Narendra Modi\u2019s far-right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central government bears chief responsibility for this catastrophe. It has insisted on keeping the economy open at all costs and is refusing to provide social support to the hundreds of millions thrust into destitution by the limited lockdown measures imposed by some state governments. Last month, as daily infections approached 300,000 and official daily deaths climbed past 3,000, Modi declared it was necessary to \u201csave India from lockdown,\u201d not to save the Indian people from the deadly virus.<\/p> <p>However, the opposition parties defend the interests of corporate India no less ruthlessly. In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was recently elected to the state government as the lead party of an electoral alliance including the Congress Party, till recently the ruling class\u2019s preferred party of national government, and the twin Stalinist parties, the Communist Party of India\u2013Marxist (CPM) and Communist Party of India (CPI).<\/p> <p>The DMK regime, like its AIADMK predecessor, which was a close ally of Modi and his BJP, has maintained a policy of allowing factories and other industrial worksites to continue operating as if there were no pandemic. Although the DMK government officially unveiled a statewide lockdown after coming to power, it granted massive exemptions for industrial worksites and factories. Speaking much like Modi, DMK chairman and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin remarked, \u201cLockdowns cannot be the solution, as we also realize that it impacts economic growth.\u201d<\/p> <p>In the face of this brutal class-war agenda, the job actions by the Hyundai and Renault Nissan workers are only the most prominent examples of mounting working-class anger. At MRF Tyres Ltd., in Puducherry, a Union Territory adjacent to Tamil Nadu, workers mounted strikes last week to demand justice and compensation for two workers who had died from COVID-19, and for the immediate shutdown of the company\u2019s plants. More than 300 workers at Caparo India, an auto parts company, took strike action against unsafe working conditions and the death of an unknown number of workers at its plants. The strike, which began on May 15, was sabotaged by the Stalinist-led Centre of Indian Trade Unions federation on May 21.<\/p> <p>In the absence of any official records of worker deaths, and with regional and national newspapers consciously covering up the extent of the slaughter, workers have begun sharing information on workplace deaths via social media. According to these sources, more than 25 workers have died in recent weeks at various globally connected companies just in Tamil Nadu. The death toll is especially high in the Sriperumbudur-Oragaram industrial area, which is located on the outskirts of Chennai, India\u2019s fourth-largest urban agglomeration and Tamil Nadu\u2019s capital. The entire region has been dubbed the \u201cDetroit of Asia\u201d because millions of autoworkers are employed there in sweatshop conditions.<\/p> <p>In the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt in the northern state of Haryana, Rajesh, one of the current leaders of the Maruti Suzuki Employees Union, and various workers forums and blogs, such as the Hindi-language Mehnatkash and Workers Unity, report that more than 20 workers have died during the recent surge in COVID-19 infections. These include five workers at Maruti Suzuki\u2019s plant in Gurgaon, two workers at a Honda plant and one worker at the Tata Motors facility.<\/p> <p>The conditions of brutal exploitation that prevail in the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt were exemplified by the monstrous 2012 company-government frame-up of Maruti Suzuki workers. In 2017, 13 militant workers at Maruti Suzuki\u2019s Manesar car assembly plant were sent to jail for life. Their sole \u201ccrime\u201d was to have led a year-long struggle, including sit-down strikes and occupations, against a brutal work regime and precarious contract-labour jobs and to build an independent union in opposition to a company-backed, state-sponsored union.<\/p> <p>As the anger among workers has grown over the past year over speedup, poverty wages and the lack of COVID-19 protections, the trade unions have worked systematically to isolate and suppress their struggles. The Stalinist-led CITU, Maoist-led AICCTU, and the LTUC in Tamil Nadu have consistently isolated workers\u2019 struggles from one another and from the wider urban and rural workforce. Each group of workers has been left to fight their government-backed transnational employer alone.<\/p> <p>At Renault-Nissan, the Renault-Nissan India Thozhillalar Sangam (RNITS) trade union, which is currently under the control of the Maoist People\u2019s Power group, urged workers last week to focus their efforts on a lawsuit aimed at getting the courts to intervene and order improvements in their working conditions. Providing yet another cynical twist to the ruling elite\u2019s \u201copen economy\u201d policy, the two-judge bench at the Madras High Court promptly responded, \u201c[W]hile the health of workers is paramount, if industries go down there will be no place for them to work.\u201d<\/p> <p>The growing number of unnecessary worker deaths underscores the urgency of an immediate shutdown of nonessential production, including the auto industry, in Tamil Nadu and across India to combat the spread of the disease and save hundreds of thousands of lives. This must be accompanied with full compensation for all workers affected and their families until the pandemic is brought under control.<\/p> <p>The billions made by the automakers and other major companies, and the hundreds of billions India\u2019s billionaires \u201cearned\u201d this year from the monies the world\u2019s central banks poured into the financial markets, must be confiscated to pay for a massive public health program, including free and universal vaccinations and social support for workers, their families, and India\u2019s impoverished masses.<\/p> <p>To fight for this programme, we urge autoworkers to establish rank-and-file action committees in every plant and at every workplace. These committees must become the political leadership and organisational framework through which workers can unify their struggles in a joint counteroffensive to place the protection of the health and very lives of the population ahead of corporate profits.<\/p> <p>The struggle against the pandemic, which is a global phenomenon that knows no boundaries, must be waged on an international basis and as a working-class political struggle. We urge Indian autoworkers and all other workers to lend their support to the construction of the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees, which is spearheading a global mobilisation of the working class, the only social force capable of combatting the pandemic and saving lives. What this requires above all is the fight for the socialist transformation of society, which is the only way to prevent globally organized corporations like Renault-Nissan, Hyundai, and Suzuki from pitting workers against each other along national lines to cut labour costs and making massive profits while their workers get sick and die.<\/p> <p>We urge all workers across India who agree with this perspective to make plans to attend this Sunday\u2019s online meeting \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic in India and the need for a socialist strategy.\u201d It begins at 6 p.m. Indian Standard Time.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3VCK0Q0PO7TZGKFEJMPJW3LSSGWN03"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":969,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Workers, Covid, unsafe","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Workers, Covid, unsafe","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":999590522,"Input.title":"Man Receives 40 Year Prison Sentence","Input.publish_date":"2021-08-17 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The office of District Attorney Micheal Murray issued the following press release Monday afternoon:<\/p> <p>On Monday, August 16, 2021 Joseph Hardman, 61, was convicted in Brown County of Aggravated Robbery and Aggravated Kidnapping, and sentenced to serve 40 years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.<\/p> <p>Hardman was convicted of robbing a convenience store in Brownwood and taking an employee hostage as he fled the scene.

They can, assistant professor \u00adChristian Baden explains, make us distrust one another and prevent any middle ground being found between believers and non-believers.<\/p> <p>Bader, along with his colleague at the Hebrew \u00adUniversity of Jerusalem Tzlil Sharon, published a 2020 paper entitled Blinded By The Lies which looked at moving towards a unified definition of a conspiracy theory.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is not what people believe,\u201d Baden says, \u201cbut how exactly they believe it.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to their paper, it\u2019s not all about New World Orders and 9\/11 inside jobs. Anything can be a conspiracy if it ticks three boxes.<\/p> <p>The first of these is the idea of \u201cpervasive \u00adpotency\u201d. This says that the things are as they are because \u00adsomeone has willed it to be that way, and their \u00adagenda has agents everywhere.<\/p> <p>The second is the \u201cManichean binary\u201d. Everything can be ordered into true and false, good and evil. There is no space for grey shade, and no space for discussion between the two sides.<\/p> <p>And the third \u2013 Baden calls it \u201cthe famous one\u201d \u2013 is that \u201cpeople believe things because they \u00adbelieve things\u201d. What someone thinks is set in stone. \u00adEvidence is discounted if it disagrees with their prior conclusion and accepted if it matches it.<\/p> <p>While one US study found nine in 10 people rate themselves as \u201cabove average\u201d in their ability to spot such disinformation and conspiratorial thinking, it also found those more confident in their abilities were more likely to be duped.<\/p> <p>And given a chance, disinformation has legs, sometimes such fast ones that falsehoods can make it all the way to the very top.<\/p> <p>In one example, the Tory leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, repeated claims of a \u201cmissing\u201d \u00a3600,000 from SNP accounts. Despite the party clarifying that the funds were \u201caccounted for minutely\u201d, the cat had been let out of the bag.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat a massive coup to get your conspiracy \u00adtheory read out by a member of the \u00adBritish \u00adCabinet of the British \u00adParliament,\u201d \u00adMcDonald says.<\/p> <p>The SNP MP has looked in depth at the issue on an international scale, including defence strategies from Finland and \u00adSweden, and disinformation emanating from China, Iran and Russia. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who started it,\u201d he says, \u201cthe fact it has got to the despatch box, what a coup!\u201d<\/p> <p>Whether or not there is any truth to the allegations is of little consequence to Rees-Mogg. Protected by parliamentary privilege he can say anything without \u00adrepercussions, and it serves to damage his political opponents.<\/p> <p>Once it has been said in parliament, it can be reported widely \u2013 and who is to say that \u201cconcerns\u201d aren\u2019t legitimate? This was, as Jared Stacy says, all about plausibility.<\/p> <p>Stacy, an American who moved to Scotland after his community became overrun with QAnon believers, is now conducting a phd in evangelicalism and conspiracies at Aberdeen University. Such conspiracies aren\u2019t \u201cjust some national news story\u201d, for him and his community, the impacts were felt \u201cvery, very personally\u201d.<\/p> <p>Stacy says that sometimes \u00adconspiracies can spread because people legitimise the possibility of falsehoods being true. He talks of people who would \u201csignal a sympathy for conspiratorial beliefs\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople who just say \u2018we don\u2019t really know\u2019, \u2018this is probably plausible\u2019, they do create a sense of respectability to these claims. They are responsible [to an extent].\u201d<\/p> <p>And while those who entertain such \u00addisinformation may bear some responsibility, more falls on the \u00adshoulders of those who create it, using it to their own political ends. Such disinformation might take the form of attacks on \u00adminorities, on politicians, or on the judiciary.<\/p> <p>These may be open, like the Daily Mail\u2019s now infamous \u201cenemies of the people\u201d front page claiming high court judges were deliberately blocking Brexit, or they may be a more subtle undermining of the rule of law.<\/p> <p>In one example, former diplomat Craig Murray was jailed for contempt of court after a judge ruled his reporting on Alex Salmond\u2019s trial \u2013 which saw the former first minister fully acquitted \u2013 could have led to the identification of the \u00adcomplainants.<\/p> <p>Murray\u2019s case shows it is not only the Unionist side which can become transfixed on ideas of conspiracy. The blogger was jailed for contempt of court in a case within the independent legal system. Yet, rumours on social media spread that he was a political prisoner, jailed for \u00addaring to report what the Government had \u00adwanted hidden.<\/p> <p>Both cannot have been true. He \u00adcannot have reported what the law said must \u00adremain secret, and at the same time not have been in contempt of court. The \u00adelusive nature of the claims that he did manage both at once are echoed in the third aspect of Baden and Sharon\u2019s \u00addefinition of a conspiracy.<\/p> <p>Other examples of disinformation don\u2019t require the luxury of being afforded legitimacy by prominent figures or \u00adpapers. A falsehood planted in fertile ground, where the people are willing to believe anything that seems to confirm what they hold to be true, can flourish unaided.<\/p> <p>Take one social media rumour which spread like wildfire over the festive \u00adperiod. Without basis, people have claimed that the First Minister went to Portugal on holiday.<\/p> <p>Screenshots were shared of flights from Glasgow to the Algarve, people claimed the \u201cmainstream media\u201d was sitting on the story and even, incredibly, that there could be a super-injunction preventing \u00adreporting of the holiday.<\/p> <p>One news site put out a call for \u00adinformation, and when the Scottish Government denied it all, suggested that the statement\u2019s purpose had been to \u00admislead.<\/p> <p>Labour peer George Foulkes tweeted: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t object if @NicolaSturgeon has taken a few days off. But we might wonder why it is apparently so secret.\u201d<\/p> <p>George Foulkes<\/p> <p>It got to the point that when putting \u201cNicola Sturgeon\u201d into Twitter\u2019s search bar, the words \u201choliday\u201d and \u201cPortugal\u201d were the top suggestions.<\/p> <p>Elsewhere, Scottish Conservative chief whip Stephen Kerr was forced into an \u00adembarrassing climbdown after he \u00adtweeted unsourced claims which had been circling on social media that the Scottish Government had set aside \u00a3350 million for indyref2.<\/p> <p>In another example, ahead of the first Covid lockdown in March 2020, Richard Lyle, the now retired SNP MSP, raised unsubstantiated online rumours of secret army bases being built around Glasgow to put the city into lockdown with the First Minister.<\/p> <p>He asked Nicola Sturgeon about \u00ad\u201cunconfirmed reports that army units are setting up in Strathclyde park\u201d on March 19, 2020 \u2013 the same day the UK Defence Journal published its first fact check \u00adrubbishing the claims.<\/p> <p>Rumours such as these which start on social media often find fertile ground easily thanks to algorithms designed to increase engagement. \u201cLiking\u201d a post \u00adencourages platforms to show us more of the same. Ignoring one may lead to the algorithm keeping similar ones off our screens altogether.<\/p> <p>This is how echo chambers grow on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, despite having billions of diverse users across the globe. And these echo chambers can be \u00admanufactured.<\/p> <p>After Twitter banned Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 riots, the \u00addisgraced president declared he would sue them, and Facebook and Google for good measure, alleging a culture of \u00ad\u201cshadow banning\u201d and anti-Conservative bias.<\/p> <p>Donald Trump<\/p> <p>His tactics clearly mirror Baden and Sharon\u2019s three facets of conspiracy. The enemy is pervasive, having infiltrated all of the biggest of the big tech firms. It is firmly evil, positioned against \u201cAmerican freedom and at the same time, freedom of speech\u201d. And it is elusive. It ignores the fact that, as a \u201cmassive-scale\u201d study involving Twitter\u2019s own team established late last year, right-wing voices \u00adactually enjoy greater amplification on the \u00adplatform than their opponents.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, Trump is using the \u00adlanguage of conspiracy to push \u00adtowards his own ends, causing an exodus of \u00adcertain people from Twitter on to platforms such as Gettr, which was founded by his \u00adformer aide Jason Miller.<\/p> <p>Often people may find themselves pushed on to such platforms by a single issue, such as fear of \u201ccensorship\u201d, and once there find themselves exposed to ever more extreme ideologies.<\/p> <p>Other times, certain social media \u00adbubbles may have been created for the explicit purpose of radicalisation.<\/p> <p>\u201cMost people\u2019s connection to \u00adreality is mediated through our devices, our algorithmic choices, and choices that are made for us,\u201d says Stacy.<\/p> <p>In an example McDonald highlights, the biggest BLM Facebook page in the US at one point was run by the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, the \u201cTrolls from Olgino\u201d.<\/p> <p>Stewart McDonald<\/p> <p>Slowly, the page began to distribute content which had nothing to do with BLM at all, but had the aim of discrediting Trump\u2019s opponents and spreading hate.<\/p> <p>\u201cDisinformation has always been a gateway to radicalisation,\u201d McDonald says.<\/p> <p>However, Baden argues that it is not \u00adsocial media to blame. \u201cIt is a facilitation, not a cause,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat works on a global platform also works in the pub on the corner.\u201d<\/p> <p>People will always find others who share their viewpoint, \u201cit is just a lot easier to find them thanks to these \u00adalgorithms, and it is a lot easier to delude yourself that this is all there is\u201d.<\/p> <p>And when rumours spread through such communities, it can be near impossible to shut them down. This is especially true in the case of the \u201cmissing \u00a3600k\u201d, Twitter\u2019s anti-Conservative bias, or Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s holiday, because the very people who have the authority and knowledge to debunk the claims are, in the eyes of the conspiracy, in on it.<\/p> <p>Conspiracy theorists will find \u00adthemselves paraphrasing Mandy Rice-Davies\u2019s famous comment during the Profumo Affair: \u201cWell, they would say that, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d<\/p> <p>Stacy says that when trying to convince people who have bought in to disinformation it\u2019s key to take account of their \u00addignity, and give them the tools they need to come to their senses.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe stakes are really high but they\u2019re human stakes. You are talking about \u00adtaking someone\u2019s reality apart, and how do you do that?<\/p> <p>\u201cThe first thing is recognising that \u00adbasically what you\u2019re attempting to do is bring someone\u2019s world crashing down.\u201d<\/p> <p>Confidence tricksters have long \u00adrelied on someone not wanting to admit to themselves that they may have been fooled. To have the truth revealed may be a painful and embarrassing experience. A person is unlikely to be converted by a single conversation.<\/p> <p>Stacy says you must look at it as if you\u2019re \u201cputting pebbles in their shoes\u201d. Make walking the path of the conspiracy uncomfortable enough that they research sources outside of that online bubble.<\/p> <p>Talking people out of the \u201crabbit hole\u201d takes time, and, McDonald says, any \u00adeffort to fight disinformation which \u00adinvolves the government alone would be \u201cspectacularly unsuccessful\u201d.<\/p> <p>He says that there needs to be a focus on teaching young people how to spot fake news from an early age, and a programme which brings in \u201cas many parts of society as possible, different languages, different cultures, people using different media across different age groups\u201d.<\/p> <p>Such an effort would go some way to combating the first aspect of a conspiracy, the idea that the malevolent forces are pervasive. While it might seem plausible that the revolving door between government and media has led to a shared agenda, \u00adinvolving faith groups, trade unions, education institutions, charities, to name but a few, would go some way to \u00addebunking that idea.<\/p> <p>But, McDonald says, there is an opportunity for Scotland in all this. Like many other nations, the UK Government\u2019s \u00adapproach to combating disinformation is, he says, \u201ca muddle\u201d.<\/p> <p>Depending on its origins and \u00adcategorisation, a falsehood may fall \u00adunder the remit of the MoD, the \u00adCabinet Office, the DCMS, Mi6, or multiple \u00addepartments at once. McDonald says these \u00addiverse \u00adbodies struggle to communicate \u00adeffectively enough to combat the \u201cscourge of disinformation\u201d.<\/p> <p>The SNP MP suggests that Scotland could host annual, worldwide \u201cclean information\u201d summits to help build a \u00adnation which is well protected against such threats, and well placed to help \u00adothers going forward.<\/p> <p>But there may be a need to repair \u00addiscourse in politics first.<\/p> <p>In the US, Stacy says: \u201cThere\u2019s something about the rhetoric in our politics and our public square that is making us prone to seeing the worst in each other.\u201d<\/p> <p>He adds: \u201cLooking at the independence debate as an outsider it would not be hard to imagine further retrenchment into these ideological ghettos.\u201d<\/p> <p>The polarised nature of the constitutional debate has only gotten more extreme since 2014, and where there is \u00addivision, bad faith actors see opportunity.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t create the division,\u201d \u00adMcDonald explains, \u201cthey work out where it is and exploit it\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo long as we don\u2019t take it seriously, and weaponisers of disinformation do take their role seriously, we will always be the poorer for it.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3ZRKL6Z1EAIT71I45KV8GPIEMWTSGN"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":582,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Scotland","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"average people, civilians, misinformation, disinformation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Scotland","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"average people, civilians, misinformation, disinformation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":929157631,"Input.title":"Cops bust White Wolf's Black Lives Matter rally","Input.publish_date":"2020-06-12 17:07:00+08:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) \u2014 A protest rally led by a former Taiwanese gang leader and pro-China figure on Friday (June 12) to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement was cut short by police, as they said he did not have the proper permits.<\/p> <p>Chinese Unity Promotion Party (CUPP, \u7d71\u4fc3\u9ee8) head Chang An-le (\u5f35\u5b89\u6a02), aka the \"White Wolf,\" on his Facebook page on Monday (June 8) wrote: \"In order to protest against the serious violation of human rights and provoking of ethnic antagonism by the U.S. government, the Chinese Unity Promotion Party will issue a solemn statement.

Just as Chang and his pack members were ready to start their rally at 10 a.m., they found themselves surrounded by 150 police officers.<\/p> <p>At the scene, participants could be heard chanting \"human rights are priceless,\" hoisting banners that showed images of George Floyd and the words \"Black Lives Matter\" and another sign saying, \"Okinawan Lives Matter.\" People dressed in the regalia of Taiwan's indigenous tribes could be seen standing behind posters listing \"political prisoners\" who have been imprisoned in the U.S. since the 1970s.<\/p> <p>Chang appeared at the scene at 10:05 a.m. decked out in an all-black Zhongshan suit.

He pointed out the U.S. has only 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of the world's incarcerated individuals.<\/p> <p>Chang also noted that while African Americans make up 12 percent of the population of the U.S., black American men comprise 45 percent of the prison population. In addition, Chang said the U.S. has \"political prisoners\" such as American indigenous rights activist Leonard Peltier, and former Black Panther Party member Sundiata Acoli, both of whom have been imprisoned for over 40 years.<\/p> <p>The former gangster said the U.S. preaches about human rights but \"only talks about others and forgets itself.\" Citing the Native Americans as an example, Chang said, \"How does the United States reward Indians on Thanksgiving? Massacre and encroachment on the land \u2014 a lot of land in the United States was stolen.\"<\/p> <p>He then called on the U.S. to respect the rights and interests of the people of the Ryukyu Islands. He said the U.S. has set up a base on Ryukyu (Okinawa) to deal with China but that \"If war erupts between China and the U.S., I don't know how many innocent Ryukyu people will be killed in a relentless fiery sea of missiles.\"<\/p> <p>Chang gives speech. (Facebook, Chang An-le photo)<\/p> <p>Police then waved a sign in front of him saying it was his second warning to disperse.

If you are not the Republic of China police, why should I listen?\"<\/p> <p>He then threatened to report the police for treason and admonished them to \"go back and look in the mirror.\" He then growled, \"You don't dare to admit you are a citizen of the Republic of China. What gives you the right to stand here?\"<\/p> <p>Chang then issued one parting shot: \"You didn't swear to uphold the Constitution? Scum,\" before turning tail and beating a hasty retreat. Chang and his troupe dismantled their banners and dispersed at 10:30 a.m.<\/p> <p>The CUPP is a pro-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organization in Taiwan, and its mission is to promote the CCP and Taiwan's unification with China. The party actively promotes the \"one country, two systems\" framework and can often be seen waving the flag of communist China, causing many public disturbances over the years with its aggressive protesting tactics.<\/p> <p>One of the more memorable incidents was when Chang brought a coffin to the Legislative Yuan to protest what he perceived to be Premier Su Tseng-chang's (\u8607\u8c9e\u660c) willingness to fight to the last man in a war with China.

WikiLeaks partnered with a wide range of media organizations worldwide that republished the War Diaries and embassy cables.<\/p> <p>The legal action underway against Mr Assange sets an extremely dangerous precedent for journalists, media organizations and the freedom of the press.<\/p> <p>We, journalists and journalistic organizations around the globe, express our grave concern for Mr Assange\u2019s wellbeing, for his continued detention and for the draconian espionage charges.<\/p> <p>This case stands at the heart of the principle of free speech. If the US government can prosecute Mr Assange for publishing classified documents, it may clear the way for governments to prosecute journalists anywhere, an alarming precedent for freedom of the press worldwide. Also, the use of espionage charges against people publishing materials provided by whistleblowers is a first and should alarm every journalist and publisher.<\/p> <p>In a democracy, journalists can reveal war crimes and cases of torture and abuse without having to go to jail. It is the very role of the press in a democracy. If governments can use espionage laws against journalists and publishers, they are deprived of their most important and traditional defense \u2013 of acting in the public interest \u2013 which does not apply under the Espionage Act.<\/p> <p>Prior to being moved to Belmarsh prison, Mr Assange spent more than a year under house arrest and then seven years inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had been granted political asylum. Throughout this time he was subjected to serious violations of his human rights, including having his legally privileged conversations spied on by organizations taking direct instruction from US agencies. Journalists visiting were subjected to pervasive surveillance. He had restricted access to legal defense and medical care and was deprived of exposure to sunlight and exercise.<\/p> <p>In April 2019, the Moreno government allowed UK law enforcement officers to enter the Ecuador embassy and seize Mr Assange. Since then he has been held in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day and, according to visitors, is \u201cheavily medicated\u201d. His physical and mental health have seriously deteriorated.<\/p> <p>As early as 2015 the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) determinedthat Mr Assange was arbitrarily detained and deprived of his liberty, and called for him to be released and paid compensation. In May 2019, the WGAD reiterated its concerns and request for his personal liberty to be restored.<\/p> <p>We hold the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Ecuador and Sweden accountable for the human rights violations to which Mr Assange has been subjected.<\/p> <p>Julian Assange has made an outstanding contribution to public interest journalism, transparency and government accountability around the world. He is being singled out and prosecuted for publishing information that should never have been withheld from the public. His work has been recognized by the Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in 2011, the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, the Index on Censorship prize, the Economist\u2019s New Media Award, the Amnesty International New Media Award, the 2019 Gavin MacFadyen Award and many others. WikiLeaks has also been nominated for the UN Mandela Prize in 2015 and for the Nobel Peace Prize seven times (2010-2015, 2019).<\/p> <p>Mr Assange\u2019s reporting of abuses and crimes is of historic importance, as have been the contributions by whistleblowers Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner, who are now in exile or incarcerated. They have all faced relentless smear campaigns waged by their opponents, campaigns that have often led to erroneous media reports and a lack of scrutiny and media coverage of their predicaments.<\/p> <p>The systematic abuse of Mr Assange\u2019s rights for the past nine years has been understood and protested by the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists and leading human rights organisations. But in public discussion there has been an insidious normalising of how he has been treated.<\/p> <p>United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer investigated the case and in June 2019 wrote:<\/p> <p>\u201cit finally dawned on me that I had been blinded by propaganda, and that Assange had been systematically slandered to divert attention from the crimes he exposed. Once he had been dehumanized through isolation, ridicule and shame, just like the witches we used to burn at the stake, it was easy to deprive him of his most fundamental rights without provoking public outrage worldwide.

When some of the operators were arrested in late 2019, others stepped up to take their place and new chatrooms cropped up.<\/p> <p>Cho mimicked chatrooms he\u2019d seen on Telegram. But he styled himself as a ruthless purveyor with access to a cache of more extreme videos to attract paying users, he said in court testimony.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy aim was, how can I be even more extreme, and get more attention?\u201d he testified this week at a co-conspirator\u2019s trial, speaking with the composure of an entrepreneur discussing a start-up venture. He has appalled the country as a man who appears as both an average college student and a criminal who intimidated his victims into torture or self-mutilation and urged his cronies to commit rape. At a previous hearing for his sentencing, he tearfully apologized and said he accepted responsibility for his crimes.<\/p> <p>One of the victims wrote an anonymous letter to perpetrators published in the newspaper Hankyoreh, recounting how fearful she felt being threatened by invisible abusers blackmailing her from beyond computer and smartphone screens.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen I saw your faces being unmasked one by one, it truly hit me that my life had been destroyed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBehind your online veil, you seemed like fictional figures. I wished it was all fiction and my reality was a passing dream.\u201d<\/p> <p>The encrypted messaging app Telegram is displayed on a smartphone in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2017. In South Korea, a ring of young men allegedly used the app to blackmail women for sexually explicit material and distributed them for profit. (Associated Press)<\/p> <p>Attorneys for the victims argued in court that the young women live with the anxiety that the videos and images they were coerced into creating would be reproduced and live indefinitely on the web.<\/p> <p>\u201cI hope their punishment is never-ending, the way my pain will never end,\u201d one victim wrote in a letter read out in court by an attorney. \u201cDid they even think there were human beings just like them on the other end of the videos?\u201d wrote another woman, who said she keeps her hair long and wears heavy makeup to shield her face, out of fear that she might get recognized from the images.<\/p> <p>Outrage over the case, which earlier this year eclipsed the COVID-19 pandemic in news cycles and conversations in South Korea, led to the passage of a law increasing punishments for those who possess or view illegally created sexual material.

Some online harassment cases her group was consulted on involved elementary school students, she said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to online sex crimes, both the victims and perpetrators are getting younger and younger,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re well versed in the web platforms, anyone can do it, and there is the solid demand to support it.\u201d<\/p> <p>She said because South Korea is at the technological forefront, the recent scandals were leading the country to wrestle with the right legal protections and prevention measures for the types of new digital sex crimes other countries will inevitably be dealing with as well.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe know it\u2019s unacceptable in the real world, but those universal standards don\u2019t seem to apply in this online space,\u201d she said.

The terms set for Odok\u2019s bail, after spending a few days in prison, included bond valued at N10m with two sureties. Just like Agba Jalingo, Odok was charged with terrorism and cyber-crime for publishing a post on Facebook. Governor Ayade\u2019s spokesperson, Christian Ita, denied the governor\u2019s involvement.<\/p> <p>There are two other pending cases against journalists in Cross River, either instituted by the Nigerian Police or the state government (although denied). Two other journalists, Jonathan Ugbal and Jeremiah, are also standing trial on treason charges after criticising the state governor, Ben Ayade. Both are news editor and managing editor respectively for CrossRiverWatch, the same online newspaper owned by Mr. Jalingo. If found guilty, these journalists could be sentenced to death.<\/p> <p>While the state government charged Jalingo with terrorism and conspiracy to remove an elected governor through nefarious activities, a copy of the police invitation letter subsequently revealed that he was summoned because he was mentioned in an investigation of \u201cConspiracy to cause Unrest and Conduct likely to Cause Breach of Peace, which was reported by the Cross River Microfinance Bank\u201d.<\/p> <p>Before his arrest, Cross RiverWatch had published a story alleging that the governor had diverted N500million from the state funds, a claim refuted by the government. Paul Ifere, another critic of Mr. Ayade\u2019s administration, was similarly arrested and detained last year for criticising Mr. Ayade.<\/p> <p>Nigeria is currently ranked 120th among countries with the highest level of Press Freedom by Reporters Without Borders (RWB), on the list with 180 countries. However, Cape Verde tops the list of African countries with the 25th position, as it is said to have one of the freest media environments in both Africa. Since the 1990s, Cape Verde, with a population of almost 500,000 people, a literacy rate of 71.6 percent, and with 30 percent of its citizens below the poverty line, has been one of the most developed and democratic African countries with a stable representative democracy.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, Nigeria has over 100 independent newspapers, and issues continue to arise when journalists report on politics, terrorism, or financial embezzlement by the powerful. Section 39 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution protects the freedom of expression, but the supposed democratic leaders continue to operate as a military junta, continually devising ways to limit every form of rights as recognised in any democracy.<\/p> <p>Speaking during an interview in January, Governor Ayade explained that the Jalingo, a man standing trial for treason, and could be sent to death for allegedly criticising his government, \u201cacted out of youthful exuberance.\u201d The level of disregard for human life, rights, and justice captured in the statement says a lot about state government led by one of the most educated governors in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Denying that he ordered the journalist\u2019s arrest, the governor said, \u201cIf you ask Agba Jalingo today, I am the one working with his lawyers for his freedom, I am the one sustaining him and sending upkeeps.\u201d But somehow, popular critics of the governor are arrested for treason and kept in detention.<\/p> <p>Although these journalists are currently on bail, these court cases are not over. On 7 February 2019, the state\u2019s Attorney General, Tanko Ashang, confirmed that the state government would take over the prosecution of Jalingo and that a letter to that effect had been filed in the Federal High Court in Calabar. The government could drag these cases as long as it wants, all in the urge to bankrupt, embarrass and punish these journalists, all because they criticised their state government. What else determines a healthy democracy, but by how free citizens can share their opinions without being attacked?<\/p> <p>Governments, either at the federal or state level, have adopted treason charges and its promise of death or life imprisonment as a means to stifle criticism and civic engagement. No voter or any Nigerian can afford to let that happen. Citizens have the right to hold any government accountable, and it is absurd for any leader to assume that it will always be right on every point.<\/p> <p>From the Social Media Bill and the Hate Speech Bill, to rampant killings by security agents, it appears the urge by political leaders to trample on their citizens is never-ending.

According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), security forces may have coordinated with unidentifiable gunmen during an overnight 6 December attack in Baghdad\u2019s al-Khilani Square that left dozens killed and more injured. Witnesses report Iraqi security forces abandoned the area shortly before the attack and returned minutes after it ended, cutting off electricity for at least an hour, immersing demonstrators in darkness during the onslaught.<\/p> <p>\u201cAll we could see was light coming from the bullets,\u201d said one protester describing the 4am attack.<\/p> <p>Palestine: Generational repression of civil rights<\/p> <p>A new report from HRW detailed how for more than 50 years, Israel has employed draconian military orders to suppress Palestinian nonviolent activity and decimate their basic civil rights, including freedom of expression and assembly.<\/p> <p>For instance, the 1967 military order 101 continues to criminalize participation in a gathering of more than ten people without a permit on an issue, which the army considers to be a political gathering punishable of up to ten years. The order also prohibits the publication of political materials or the display of flags or political symbols without army approval. Meanwhile, 2010\u2019s military order 1651 imposes a ten-year sentence on anyone who attempts to \u2013 orally or otherwise \u2013 influence public opinion in the West Bank in a manner that \u201cmay harm public peace or public order\u201d or \u201cpublishes words of praise, sympathy or support for a hostile organization, its actions or objectives,\u201d which the army defines as \u201cincitement.\u201d The vaguely worded order also states that \u201coffenses against authorities\u201d can carry a sentence of life imprisonment.<\/p> <p>The real-life consequences of these orders have been disastrous for civil society and non-violent actions in the West Bank. According to the report, between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2019, a total of 4,590 Palestinians were prosecuted for entering a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d \u2013 a designation the Israeli army imposes on protest sites in real-time \u2013 while 1,704 were prosecuted for \u201cmembership and activity in an unlawful association\u201d, and 358 for \u201cincitement.\u201d<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, in digital rights<\/p> <p>To mark last month\u2019s 16-days of activism against gender-based violence, the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media (7amleh) launched a campaign addressing the phenomenon of violence, harassment and extortion of Palestinian women online. The campaign saw social media influencers in the West Bank push the conversation online through infographics and multimedia, drawing on 7amleh\u2019s research on the issue, which revealed one-third of young, Palestinian women are subjected to violence or sexual harassment online.<\/p> <p>Saudi Arabia: a \u2018mockery of justice\u2019 for Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder<\/p> <p>It has been over a year since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into a Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul, never to be seen again. Late last month, the official investigation into his death came to a predictable end after the kingdom\u2019s public prosecutor office announced it had sentenced five people to death and handed out jail terms for three others allegedly complicit in his murder, calling the crime \u201cspontaneous\u201d and not premeditated.<\/p> <p>The Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) condemned the verdicts, noting the trial lacked the minimum standards of a fair trial and due process. The rights organization also called on international bodies to ensure top Saudi officials involved in the killing do not evade justice \u2013 a call reiterated by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).<\/p> <p>\u201cConducting a sham trial for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and sentencing five people to death shows that the Saudi government under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is committed to an ongoing mockery of justice,\u201d said CPJ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator, Sherif Mansour. \u201cThe international community, including the U.S., must not allow Saudi Arabia to keep evading justice in the Khashoggi case.\u201d<\/p> <p>Dr. Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, who investigated the killing and published her findings back in June 2019, called the verdict \u201cthe antithesis of justice\u201d. Callamard\u2019s UN report highlighted the extensive planning of the murder, and included audio from Turkish authorities in which a team of Saudi agents, while waiting for Khashoggi to arrive at the embassy to pick up necessary papers for his planned nuptials, can be overheard discussing how they would carry the body out of the building.<\/p> <p>Bottom line: the hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death. The masterminds not only walk free. They have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial. That is the antithesis of Justice. It is a mockery. \u2014 Agnes Callamard (@AgnesCallamard) December 23, 2019<\/p> <p>While Callamard\u2019s report concluded that the killing \u201cwas overseen, planned and endorsed by high-level officials,\u201d the recent verdict in Saudi Arabia has provided total immunity for those very officials in the chain of command, while scapegoating those tasked with carrying out the murder.<\/p> <p>The end-result sends a chilling message to dissidents from the region living in exile: that their safety abroad is far from secure.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is not just about the justice Jamal deserves, or even closure for his friends and family. This is also about deterrence; so another critic is not killed in London\u2019s Hyde Park, abducted from a Toronto suburb or assaulted in a D.C. bar,\u201d said Egyptian human rights advocate Mohamed Soltan in a Washington Post Op Ed. \u201cWhen we seek justice and accountability, we are not seeking to avenge Jamal\u2019s murder.

With pistols drawn, the group doused Eid in red paint while warning him to \u201cbehave himself\u201d.<\/p> <p>This is the fourth attack on the prominent activist since October 2019, prompting a call from GCHR on international bodies like the UN to step in and protect Eid.

A high school student subsequently received a three-year sentence for posting lyrics to Gnawi\u2019s viral track on social media.<\/p> <p>Moroccan rapper Gnawi has been charged with \u201coffending\u201d public officials in an Instagram live.

Last month, rights groups issued a joint statement calling on authorities to release the prominent activists, now known as the Douma Four, who were investigating war crimes committed by Syrian authorities at the time of their kidnapping. While rebel group Jaysh Al-Islam is widely believed to be behind their abduction, they remain among some 98,000 Syrians forcibly disappeared since March 2011 whose fate remains unknown.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, digital activists have pushed back on Twitter\u2019s recent announcement that it would be deleting inactive accounts, which would include those of forcibly disappeared activists like Razan Zaitouneh and those killed, such as slain radio host Raed Fares. \u201cDeleting their accounts could deal a significant blow to the Syrian memory as well as deprive us of vital evidence for use in justice and accountability processes,\u201d said Syrian Archive\u2019s co-founder, Hadi Al-Khatib in a recent interview.<\/p> <p>UAE<\/p> <p>The security apparatus has targeted dozens of relatives of Emirati dissidents who are either currently detained or living abroad. According to HRW, relatives of eight dissidents have seen their citizenships revoked, have been arbitrarily denied access to services, and have faced restrictions placed on their ability to access jobs and higher education. Relatives have also been subject to state surveillance, threats, and regular questioning by security officials who are empowered by a 2003 federal law granting the security apparatus a wide mandate to curb political activity, by force if necessary.<\/p> <p>Documenting the region<\/p> <p>Finally, in its annual global survey, CPJ says the number of imprisoned journalists in the region has risen, with Egypt and Saudi Arabia now ranked as the third worst jailers in the world after China.

elections that were held in a largely unfree and unfair environment. President al-Sisi rose to power on the heels of the June 30 mass protests, when he, as the then-defense minister, led the Egyptian military\u2019s move to unseat Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi. He was elected for his first presidential term in the summer of 2014, and since that time his government has dramatically escalated the state\u2019s repression and violence against his fellow citizens to stifle all forms of dissent.<\/p> <p>The human rights situation in Egypt has collapsed since Egypt\u2019s last Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2014. Instead of implementing even small steps towards justice for the most serious crimes, authorities have relied on a state of emergency and repressive counterterrorism laws to suppress freedoms of expression and association and to largely silence peaceful dissent, including by prosecuting journalists and human rights activists. Abusive state agencies, particularly the Interior Ministry\u2019s National Security Agency and the police, have tortured, abused, and disappeared opponents with near-total impunity. The government has further restricted basic freedoms, including through new legislation passed by parliament, which has largely become a rubber stamp for Al-Sisi\u2019s policy decisions. The March 2018 presidential vote was held in an unfree, unfair environment. Under such severe repression, authorities have been moving to pass constitutional amendments that would end any judiciary independence and invite army intervention in politics.<\/p> <p>Legislative and Constitutional Human Rights Framework<\/p> <p>Though it contained important human rights guarantees, Egypt\u2019s 2014 constitution fails to address many of the pressing rights issues in the country. In practice, authorities have shown little respect for constitutional guarantees of rights and have even passed laws that contradict them despite its acceptance of the 2014 recommendation to \u201ccontinue efforts to harmonize national legislation with international norms.\u201d<\/p> <p>Contrary to the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to \u201cstrengthen measures, including the adoption of necessary legislation, to give effect to the rights enshrined in ICCPR,\u201d authorities have been using counterterrorism and state-of-emergency laws and courts to subvert rights protections and unjustly prosecute bloggers, activists, and ordinary citizens for their peaceful criticism.<\/p> <p>President al-Sisi declared a nation-wide state of emergency in April 2017, following Islamic State-claimed church bombings that killed 45 people. The state of emergency has been uninterruptedly renewed since then. The 1958 Emergency Law gives unchecked powers to security forces to arrest people and allows the government to impose media censorship and order forced evictions. A constitutional court ruling annulling some of these powers was quickly circumvented by new amendments the parliament passed that granted al-Sisi the power to re-apply these abusive practices.<\/p> <p>Examples of abusive new laws that severely undermine citizens\u2019 rights include:<\/p> <p>Law 70 of 2017 known as the new NGO law. It effectively attempts to eliminate independent human rights work, places all NGOs under the effective veto power of a council dominated by representatives of the security agencies, and allows the government to dissolve NGOs based on broadly-worded infractions.<\/p> <p>Law 180 of 2018 for regulating media. It ushered in increased levels of government censorship of the media, including news websites and social media. Around 600 websites, including those of human rights and media organizations, have been blocked without a court order in 2017 and 2018.<\/p> <p>Law 95 of 2015 for counterterrorism. The law erodes basic rights and espouses an overly broad definition of terrorism that includes civil disobedience and free expression. It also prevents police officers from questioning for any use of force during counterterrorism operations.<\/p> <p>Law 8 of 2015 on \u201cTerrorist Entities.\u201d The government used the law to list hundreds of individuals and entities on the country\u2019s \u201cterrorism list\u201d without any hearings or trials, and instead mainly based on unchallenged memos submitted by prosecutors.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Repeal or drastically revise all abusive laws, including those listed above, and ensure that all laws comply with Egypt\u2019s international obligations;<\/p> <p>Withdraw new constitutional amendments that would further undermine judiciary independence and provide for military intervention in politics.<\/p> <p>Impunity and Security Forces\u2019 Serious Abuses<\/p> <p>Excessive Use of Force and Extrajudicial Executions.<\/p> <p>Egypt failed to implement the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to \u201cinvestigate excessive use of force by security forces\u201d and to \u201cprosecute those identified as being responsible.\u201d<\/p> <p>More than five years after the systematic mass killing of protesters in Rab\u2019a Square in Cairo, in August 2013, the authorities did not question or investigate a single member of the security forces responsible for the killing of at least 817 people that day during their violent dispersal of the largely-peaceful sit-in supporting former President Mohamed Morsy.<\/p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch\u2019s review of official Interior Ministry\u2019s statements, the ministry\u2019s security forces have killed at least 270 persons between 2015 and 2018 in more than 80 incidents which the ministry claimed the people were killed in shootouts but provided limited or no evidence to justify the deadly use of force. No transparent investigations were allowed into such incidents. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented how several of those incidents, two of which were video-recorded, appeared to be extrajudicial killings including the killing of previously detained persons in likely staged \u201cshoot-outs.\u201d<\/p> <p>Enforced Disappearance and ill-treatment and Torture.<\/p> <p>Egypt failed to implement the 2014 UPR recommendations to prosecute and punish \u201cpossible crimes committed by security officers\u201d and to ensure \u201call detained persons are protected by law and physically against torture and all other ill-treatment.\u201d A 2017 Human Rights Watch investigation discovered that torture is being used systematically and on a widespread scale in Egypt. Interior Ministry police and National Security Forces have disappeared hundreds of people in the past years and subjected scores to severe torture including by electric shocks, rape and threat of rape. Since July 2013, the independent campaign \u201cStop Enforced Disappearance\u201d has documented 1,530 enforced disappearances from July 2013 to August 2018. According to the Egyptian newspaper Al Watan, which cited statistics from the Justice Ministry\u2019s Forensic Medical Authority, at least 90 people died in local police stations and security directorates in the governorates of Cairo and Giza alone in 2014. This number reached 118 in 2017, according to a detailed report published by the Egyptian NGO El-Nadeem Centre.<\/p> <p>Egypt did not amend its laws to properly define torture and enforced disappearance crimes. On the contrary, the Egyptian government added more layers of protection for security officials. In July 2018, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi approved Law No.161 of 2018 on the \u201ctreatment of the armed forces\u2019 senior commanders,\u201d which shielded senior military commanders from being questioned for abuses that occurred between July 2013 and January 2016 unless the Supreme Council of Armed Forces gives permission. The 2015 counterterrorism law states that officers cannot be questioned for the use of force during counterterrorism operations.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Ensure security forces act in accordance with international human rights laws and standards on the use of force, including the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;<\/p> <p>Ensure that all those detained are protected from torture or other ill-treatment, and that detention conditions meet international standards;<\/p> <p>Repeal all laws that grant impunity to security officials from being questioned over abuses such as the 2015 counterterrorism law;<\/p> <p>Bring the crimes of torture and enforced disappearance in national law into conformity with the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;<\/p> <p>Ensure that investigations into human rights violations are impartial, independent and effective. The Justice Ministry should appoint a commission composed of law professors, legal experts, human rights activists and prosecutors with concrete powers to transparently and openly initiate criminal investigations into torture and disappearance crimes;<\/p> <p>Immediately launch open, transparent investigations into the unlawful use of lethal force by security forces that has resulted in the killing of thousands of protesters and bystanders;<\/p> <p>Establish torture-prevention mechanisms including by allowing independent oversight over all detention places, and in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.<\/p> <p>Unfair Trials, Selective Justice and Death Penalty<\/p> <p>Since its 2014 UPR, Egypt also failed to implement an accepted recommendation to ensure \u201cfair, equitable and independent judicial procedures.\u201d In their prosecution of activists and peaceful opponents, Egyptian authorities used Emergency State Security Courts, a parallel judicial system re-instated since October 2017, under the state of emergency that the government uses to prosecute political activists. These courts do not guarantee a fair trial and their decisions are not subject to appeal. The 2014 constitution permits military trials for civilians. Between October 2014, when al-Sisi decreed a law that vastly expanded military court jurisdiction, and late 2017, authorities have referred more than 15,000 civilians to military prosecutions. Many of these unfair trials ended in death sentences. Egyptian laws provide for the death penalty for over 100 offenses. Death sentences and executions have sharply increased in recent years.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Cease the practice of trying civilians before military trials;<\/p> <p>Abolish State Security Courts;<\/p> <p>Ensure that all those detained on recognizably criminal charges are tried in proceedings that fully conform with international fair trial guarantees, without recourse to the death penalty;<\/p> <p>Repeal all laws that allow for prosecuting people for peacefully exercising or demanding their civil, political, cultural and economic rights such as the 2018 new medial regulations and the 2013 protest law;<\/p> <p>Issue a moratorium on the death penalty as a matter of priority.<\/p> <p>Restrictions against Freedom of Expression, Assembly, and Association<\/p> <p>During its last UPR, Egypt accepted recommendations to \u201cadopt the law affirming the right to establish nongovernmental organizations merely upon notification\u201d and to provide and guarantee an environment \u201cconducive to the work of journalists, human rights defenders and civil society organizations.\u201d Despite this, President al-Sisi ratified the NGO law in May 2017 that criminalizes the work of NGOs, providing for up to five-year prison terms for failing to adhere to its provisions such as operating or receiving funds without government approval. During President al-Sisi\u2019s tenure, Egypt has become among the worst three jailers of journalists in the world with roughly 25 journalists in jail in March 2019, despite the accepted 2014 UPR recommendation to \u201cguarantee the freedom of expression\u201d and to \u201cprotect journalists from violence and harassment.\u201d Authorities have continued the prosecutions of scores of the country\u2019s leading human rights activists and organizations in case 173 of 2011, known as the \u201cforeign funding\u201d case, despite the UN, US, and EU calls to end them.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Immediately cease harassment and persecution of opposition activists exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including defamation campaigns and threats;<\/p> <p>Release and drop charges against all those detained solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including national and international media personnel arrested in the context of performing their duties as journalists;<\/p> <p>Also release and drop charges against all those detained for exercising their rights to freedom of association, including those detained solely for membership in the Muslim Brotherhood. The government should amend Law 107 of 2013 restricting freedom of assembly to bring it in line with international standards on freedom of assembly and association.<\/p> <p>Abuses against Religious Minorities<\/p> <p>Egypt\u2019s 2014 constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the rights of minorities and the country accepted a 2014 UPR recommendation to ensure \u201cthe respect for freedom of religion or belief for all its citizens\u201d and to \u201ctake further steps to ensure the promotion of the values of tolerance.\u201d But authorities continued to prosecute writers and activists on charges of \u201ccontempt of religion\u201d and \u201cblasphemy,\u201d including religious minorities and proclaimed atheists. In 2015, courts handed prison sentences to two men, who later went into hiding, for allegedly supporting atheism online. The same year also witnessed prosecutors in Beni Suef governorate ordering a local man arrested for allegedly posting cartoons online that insulted the prophet Mohamed.<\/p> <p>Egyptian Copts, who comprise roughly 10 percent of the population and are the largest Christian minority in the Middle East, have faced abuses and been targeted by extremist groups. Authorities failed to protect the Coptic community from sectarian violence and terrorist attacks. ISIS targeted Egyptian Christians on several occasions during the last few years killing scores of church-goers.<\/p> <p>The restrictive Law 80 of 2016 on the construction of churches allowed for legalizing scores of churches that were operating without an official permit, but restrictions remain largely in place and hundreds of churches without a permit lack legal protection. The rights group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) documented the closure by the authorities of 14 churches in 2018 alone.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Cease harassment and persecution of members of religious minorities including atheists, Christian Copts, and Shia\u2019 Muslims;<\/p> <p>Take steps to ensure the full and effective protection of the lives and property of religious minorities by holding accountable those responsible for attacks against religious minorities and investigating instances where security forces failed to respond to such attacks;<\/p> <p>Amend Law 80 of 2016 to remove restrictions on building and renovating churches and end discrimination against Christians.<\/p> <p>Gender-Based Discrimination and LGBT Rights<\/p> <p>Sexual harassment and violence against women remained endemic. Though Egypt accepted the 2014 UPR recommendation to take \u201cmeasures to eliminate discrimination against women,\u201d Egyptian women continued to face discrimination under Egypt\u2019s personal status law on equal access to divorce, child custody, and inheritance. Egypt also accepted the 2014 UPR recommendation to adopt legislation to \u201ccriminalize all forms of violence against women,\u201d yet no law was issued to combat domestic violence including to prevent abuse, protect survivors and prosecute abusers. Other forms of violence against women, including child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), continued in some areas, despite laws strengthening penalties against some of those crimes. However, in practice, authorities have prosecuted very few perpetrators despite how widespread such acts are.<\/p> <p>Egypt continues to prosecute scores of people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. At least 76 people were prosecuted under the \u201cdebauchery\u201d law based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in 2018. Many are picked up by security officers on the streets, often solely on the basis of their gender-nonconforming appearance. In other cases, security officers entrap LGBT people through dating applications. The arrests in 2018 follow a wave of arrests in 2017, when, security forces arrested at least 75 gay and transgender people and activists after a few activists raised a rainbow flag, a sign of LGBT activism, at a concert in Cairo. Egypt routinely conducts forced anal examinations on people accused of homosexual conduct and, unlike other countries in the region, has taken no steps to ban these exams, which constitute a form of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment according to the UN Committee Against Torture. The government stopped authorizing sex reassignment surgeries for transgender people in 2016 and has provided no pathway to changing gender markers on official documents.<\/p> <p>Recommendations<\/p> <p>Enact legislation to combat domestic violence and amend personal status laws that discriminate against women on issues of divorce, custody, and inheritance;<\/p> <p>Immediately put an end to the arrest and prosecution of people for their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity;<\/p> <p>End forced anal examinations of persons accused of consensual same-sex conduct and provide a rights-respecting pathway to legal gender recognition, through an administrative process based on self-identification;<\/p> <p>Actively prosecute perpetrators of FGM;<\/p> <p>Lift travel bans and asset freezes of women\u2019s rights activists such as Mozn Hassan and Azza Solimon and allow women\u2019s rights groups to operate independently and without harassment or fear of reprisal.<\/p> <p>Economic and Social Rights Abuses<\/p> <p>Authorities held in May 2018 the first trade union elections in Egypt in 12 years. However, while state officials claimed the elections were transparent and fair, results only reflected the former status quo, with the government-affiliated Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) emerging from the process effectively in control of the unions. The Center for Trade Union and Workers Services, the oldest independent labor rights group in Egypt, said that the elections were marred by violations such as the exclusion from the electoral process of hundreds of candidates not aligned with the government.<\/p> <p>The parliament passed a new trade union law in December 2017. However, in the view of trade unionists and labor activists, the law \"was only issued to win favor with the International Labor Organization,\u201d and it kept in place several restrictions on the right to organize. Strikes remain criminalized in Egyptian law. Authorities arrested or charged at least 180 workers for peaceful workplace strikes and protests in 2016 and 2017, mostly over bonuses and delayed wages.<\/p> <p>Recommendations:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3MG8450X2QPFZR37X8GVPZEU8K1UP9"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":362,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Egypt","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Egyptian citizens, women's rights, sexual assault, gender identity, LGBT rights","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mozn Hassan","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Azza Solimon","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2014.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Egypt","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Egyptian citizens, women's rights, sexual assault, gender identity, LGBT rights","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mozn Hassan","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Azza Solimon","victim_keywords":"women's rights activist, travel restriction, asset freeze","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":942080412,"Input.title":"Chronicle of Crimes Foretold: Delhi Riots' FIR 59\/2020 and the 'Meerut Conspiracy\u2019 Parable","Input.publish_date":"2020-05-11 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The investigating agencies inquiring into the Delhi riots have worked uncompromisingly through the coronavirus pandemic. I doubt officers have had any time for their families, let alone for parables. Here\u2019s hoping they will indulge me, because I see in the Delhi Riots Conspiracy Case the police have come up with clear shades of the Meerut Conspiracy Case of 1929.<\/p> <p>It was a little more than 90 years ago that Viceroy Irwin \u2013 miffed with the relentless anti-imperialist agitations in India involving everyone from students, workers and peasants \u2013 tried to devise some way to cripple the nationalist Indian leadership and certain British socialists whom he was convinced were behind the protests. Secret communications flew thick and fast between the viceroy and the India Office in London, and a new law was proposed to give the government of India the power to remove any political organiser from British India, or even bar left-leaning Indians from travelling abroad so as not to expose them to further ideas.<\/p> <p>However, this proposed law, the \u2018Public Safety Bill\u2019, was defeated in the Indian legislative assembly in September 1928 because of the concerted efforts of nationalist members. During the assembly debates, Lala Lajpat Rai scoffed at the idea that the special law was necessitated by the presence of two British Communists who had been organising workers\u2019 strikes in support of the freedom movement. It was absurd to suppose that a few men could be instrumental in bringing about such widespread expressions of dissent, he said. Srinivas Iyengar also opposed the Bill on the grounds that \u2018no proof had been furnished that the British government was going to be destroyed or Indian society subverted [because of such hartals]. It was the will of a police officer, a district officer or a commercial magnate strong enough to press his view, which the governor-general-in-council accepted without enquiry\u2019.<\/p> <p>In the aftermath of this defeat, which was seen as a nationalist victory, the colonial government announced it would reintroduce the Bill in the next session, and followed the announcement with an unyielding, single-minded campaign denouncing the \u2018communist menace\u2019 and propagating the idea that the defeat of the Bill was detrimental to the security of the state.<\/p> <p>Lord Irwin, for his part, sent another secret missive to the Secretary of State in Britain:<\/p> <p>\u201cAlthough these movements are still in their infancy and may not be a serious menace in India for some little time, nevertheless they contain great potentialities of danger, and we are bound therefore to see what steps can be taken to discourage them while they are weak and prevent anything in the nature of rapid growth. We must consider what we can do in the way of preventing the Indian movement, which by itself is very weak, from receiving any impetus from outside either in the form of money or what is still more important, of brains and organizing capacity [\u2026] The Public Safety Bill as you have seen was defeated in the Assembly by the President\u2019s casting vote and I have been carefully considering what lines we should take in the matter. We hope to run a conspiracy case against a considerable number of communists in India.\u2019 [From Sir David Petrie and Sir Horace Williamson, Directors of Intelligence, Unpublished Papers, Edited by Saha, emphasis added]<\/p> <p>The conspiracy case was run indeed, for four-and-a-half long years. Jurist and constitutional expert A.G. Noorani says that uniquely amongst political trials even, the stated objective of the \u2018Meerut Conspiracy Case\u2019 was not to secure the conviction of the 32 accused, but rather to crush the imminent Civil Disobedience Movement. \u2018The accused were to be punished for the beliefs they held; not for any illegal act they had committed.\u2019<\/p> <p>The Public Safety Bill was to be reintroduced in the assembly on March 21, 1929. On the evening of March 20, raids were conducted in Bombay, Calcutta, Allahabad, Delhi, Lahore and other places: in houses, trade unions and at newspaper offices. Thirty-two people, members of the AICC and AITUC, the Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Party, were arrested and tried in Meerut. Although only two of the 32 arrested were from Meerut, it was chosen as the seat of trial by the prosecution in order to deny the benefit of a jury trial to the accused.<\/p> <p>The end result, however, was far from satisfactory for the colonial authorities.<\/p> <p>Delhi riots and FIR 59\/2020<\/p> <p>Ninety kilometres and 91 years separate Meerut and Delhi and the two conspiracy cases but it is hard not to miss the similarity between the political impulse behind both.<\/p> <p>FIR 59\/2020 was filed at the instance of a sub-Inspector, and on the basis of information received from an unnamed police informer. It states that the Delhi riots were planned by certain persons, who used the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests as an opportunity to mobilise the masses against the government of the day. Specifically, it alleges that speeches were given that encouraged people to protest in the streets during US President Donald Trump\u2019s Delhi visit, with the aim to internationally further the \u2018propaganda\u2019 that minorities were being oppressed in India.<\/p> <p>Normally, FIRs refrain from making political statements. Sometimes, they reproduce the offending speech, verbatim, but it is unusual for an FIR to denounce a political assertion as \u2018propaganda\u2019. Whether minorities are in fact being oppressed in India is a political question, or, in specific cases, a judicial one, so it is certainly odd that the FIR pronounces it propaganda and delegitimises the entire protest at the very outset.<\/p> <p>The FIR does not mention any invocation to violence in the speeches. Yet, remarkably, it invokes Sections 147 [rioting], 148 [rioting armed with deadly weapons], 149 [being a member of a common assembly and acting in common object] and 120 B [criminal conspiracy], thus treating all anti-CAA protestors (and all protests across India) as a single collective rioting agent, while never once explicitly alleging that the protestors rioted.<\/p> <p>Also Read: Delhi Riots 2020: There Was a Conspiracy, But Not the One the Police Alleges<\/p> <p>There is a single reference to information being received that certain homes in northeast Delhi had stored firearms, petrol bombs, acid and stones, but there is no obvious connection of these homes with the protest. Even if the allegation were that some of these homeowners had attended the protests, it is not clear why their individual culpabilities in their homes would turn the entire protest into a rioting collective.<\/p> <p>Derren Brown is a fascinating \u2018mentalist\u2019, or illusionist: he can manipulate any audience into thinking in a particular way. He says he does it by subtly and repeatedly inserting an idea into their heads. Thus, if at the beginning of a show he refers to someone as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019, and casually continues to do so during his act, he can get his audience to react to that person in a particular way by the end of the show.<\/p> <p>FIR 59\/2020 turns the protestors into rioters in peoples\u2019 minds, without alleging any instance of collective violence by the assembly. The fact of the assembly itself is treated as an offence.<\/p> <p>The FIR records that women and children deliberately blocked the road outside the Jaffrabad metro station, inconveniencing others and adding to the tense atmosphere, such that riots broke out. It is silent on who was apparently so provoked by the protestors that they felt that violent action to clear them out was justified. It does not attribute any violence to the protestors at Jaffrabad, but it implies that blocking the road and inconveniencing others was \u2018violence\u2019 in itself, which led to retaliatory action by others.<\/p> <p>There was a time when the familiar trope for orchestrating a riot was slaughtering a pig and throwing it outside a mosque; or leaving a bag of meat in a temple; or pelting stones at a religious place or a religious gathering. Each of these actions, deliberate attempts to provoke communal violence, were offences in themselves.<\/p> <p>FIR 59\/2020 has successfully changed that trope by equating the anti-CAA protests with such provocation, proclaiming the protestors collectively as rioters, and suggesting that minority dissent to an idea that has popular support otherwise is in itself, a provocative act, and good reason for the outbreak of riots. In its silence on those who actually retaliated violently to the protests, it treats them as automated bots responding to \u2018protest provocation\u2019, and seems to find no reason to go into their individual and active roles.<\/p> <p>The FIR also doesn\u2019t look at the \u2018charged circumstances\u2019 as a gradual build-up: what accentuating circumstances turned the protests into a hateful thing for non-participants? It is not common in our country for any section of people to feel provoked by any other group \u2013 or indeed by the government \u2013 for merely having been \u2018inconvenienced\u2019. What was the role of certain leaders, or that of the media, in turning the protestors into monsters? What were the omissions, if any, on the part of the administration and the police? FIR 59 rather treats the fact of the protests as an apriori reason for retaliatory violence.<\/p> <p>Be that as it may, it is altogether possible for any peaceful protest to become disorderly at any given moment, due to extraneous circumstances, or from a generally charged atmosphere.<\/p> <p>Also Read: Delhi Police Affidavit Shows Muslims Bore Brunt of Riots, Silent on Who Targeted Them and Why<\/p> <p>While the constitution of India guarantees the right to assemble peacefully under Article 19(1)(b), this right is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India and of public order. If a public assembly has the potential of becoming unruly, or causing others to become unruly, the police have the responsibility to disperse it using minimal and proportionate force.<\/p> <p>Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code says that an assembly may be designated an \u2018unlawful assembly\u2019 if it commits any criminal trespass, or any other offence, or if it deprives any person of the right of way, etc. An assembly that was not previously lawful may be designated \u2018unlawful\u2019 with changing circumstances.<\/p> <p>Upon such designation, if a breach of peace seems imminent, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Police Manuals describe a detailed code of conduct, which includes involving officers of the administration to persuade the protestors to disperse, followed by warning, and then application of minimal and proportionate force [Sections 129 and 130 of the CrPC The police also have the right to detain members of the unlawful assembly during the process of dispersal, or to preventively detain its leaders].<\/p> <p>Post-facto prosecutions are possible, too: Sections 142 to 145 of the Indian Penal Code describe offences that range from knowingly being a member of an unlawful assembly, to being present in an unlawful assembly while armed with a deadly weapon, which, when used \u2018as a weapon of offence\u2019, is likely to cause death. All these offences are cognizable and bailable.<\/p> <p>\u2018Deep-rooted conspiracy\u2019<\/p> <p>FIR 59 does not frame the alleged unruliness in terms of applicable law, which assesses the unlawfulness of an assembly \u2018in the moment\u2019. It frames it in terms of \u2018a deep-rooted conspiracy\u2019: of political action that opposed the CAA, and was implicitly \u2018seditious\u2019 and provocative, and which must, therefore, be the focus of all investigations relating to the riots.<\/p> <p>There have been several arrests, some even under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), mostly of students and activists involved in the protest. Many others have been summoned, amongst them writers and teachers, art workers and filmmakers, people who are otherwise called \u2018intellectuals\u2019, purveyors of new ideas.<\/p> <p>In investigating the intellectuals, the police are really investigating their ideas. \u2018Why do you oppose the citizen amendment act? Why do you support street protests that inconvenience people? Why were you actively mobilizing people in support? What do you want so much \u2018azadi\u2019 for? You people have been allowed too much freedom in the past.\u2019<\/p> <p>It is not unknown for the police to question political ideas; however, the \u2018midnight knock\u2019 is associated with authoritarian regimes. In India, on the other hand, the constitution has allowed for loud political dissent. Even protests that embarrass the government of the day have ordinarily not been subject to investigative scrutiny under special acts.<\/p> <p>Mobilising support for a political idea is a democratic process, even when it seeks to rupture or dislodge a prevailing discourse. In my experience, I\u2019ve seen the Babri masjid-Ramjanambhoomi movement redefine Indian selfhood, significantly rupturing previously held notions. Politically, and peacefully, it is not illegal to mobilise even to make the polity \u2018mukt\u2019 from a certain party or ideology (although to make it \u2018mukt\u2019 of a people would amount to hate speech\/ genocide). It is not a \u2018shadowy conspiracy\u2019 to suggest that the government of the day is apathetic to a section of the population. Those claims have often been made: most forcefully, in fact, by the ruling party in its assertion that the incumbents practised appeasement and neglected the majority.<\/p> <p>The contours of a penal offence, as different from dissenting politics, are very well defined. Demonstrations and street protests are not in themselves seditious or dangerous. If they block traffic, they may be dealt with under applicable sections of the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes. What is indeed an offence is a direct call to violence at such a demonstration and a causal and immediate link between the speech and actual violence.<\/p> <p>The Tilak sedition trial<\/p> <p>FIR 59 has, in fact, moved the clock even further back than 1929, to Bal Gangadhar Tilak\u2019s sedition trial of 1897. In Tilak\u2019s trial, the presiding judge, Justice Strachey, expanded the meaning of sedition, from violently inciting people against the government, to include general lack of affection for it. Thus any show of bitterness, or suspicion, or any speech or writing that might encourage others to like the government any less was termed seditious. Tilak was sent to jail for writing against the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, promulgated during the Bombay plague, which gave the British administration wide regulatory powers over the local population.<\/p> <p>Also Read: How Bal Gangadhar Tilak\u2019s 1897 Trial Marked the Criminalisation of Dissent<\/p> <p>The post-independence Indian Supreme Court, on the other hand, categorically rejects that forceful discursive criticisms of the government and its policies are bases for sedition. It has employed the \u2018spark in the powder keg\u2019 test, which denotes speech or action that is as immediately incendiary as a lit fuse (chanting \u2018goli maro\u2026\u2019 in close proximity to, and with reference to a group of people; and if soon thereafter somebody actually fires on a representative sections of that group, for instance). FIR 59 on the other hand, implies an \u2018embers in the wind\u2019 theory: it criminalises sustained criticism of the government, ostensibly on grounds that this has the potential to cause disaffection. Unfortunately, the claim has no basis in law.<\/p> <p>In its construction of the anti-CAA protests, FIR 59 is not neutral. It takes the position that these political protests were based on misrepresentations, were anti-state and treacherous. By doing so, it criminalises arguments around minority rights and against the CAA; it makes suspect any kind of protest against the government, and it normalises the humiliation of scores of teachers and students when they are summoned to police stations and interrogated for their participation in the protests. FIR 59 makes believable even the most absurd, uncorroborated allegations about the grave \u2018conspiracy\u2019 of the protests, and thus equally acceptable that the police should take several extensions on the submission of the chargesheet \u2013 the substantiation of the allegations in the FIR \u2013 while accused wait in jail.<\/p> <p>Back to the future<\/p> <p>To come back to the Meerut Conspiracy Case, the investigations produced 25 printed, folio-sized volumes of documentary evidence. Three thousand five hundred prosecution exhibits and about 320 witnesses from across Britain and India sought to prove the political activities of the accused and their associations with each other. It was officially announced at the end of the trial that the process had cost 126,000 pounds.<\/p> <p>However, at the end of proceedings in 1933, the high court let off the accused with minimal sentences. It also so happened that over the four-and-half-years, the proceedings attracted a lot of sympathetic interest in the political issues at hand, both in India and abroad. There was an outcry in the British press and parliament: the conservative government even lost the general election of May 1929. Neither was the anti-colonial political movement seriously affected, apparently because it had mass appeal, beyond its few organisers who had been arrested.<\/p> <p>It has been said that the process left Lord Irwin and also the Secretary of State quite \u2018disillusioned\u2019.

His health has deteriorated drastically since his imprisonment in May. In November, 60 doctors signed an open letter warning that he could die in prison. He is scheduled to appear in court in February for a hearing to determine whether the United Kingdom will extradite him to the United States where the government has prepared to charge him under the Espionage Act.<\/p> <p>Assange is guilty of nothing more than exposing to the world the US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the infamous Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails of 2016 that revealed the DNC acted illegally to thwart the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders for president. This political vendetta against a journalist, in opposition to international law, is being spearheaded by the US government, military and intelligence agencies.<\/p> <p>The government\u2019s own documents brought to light by Wikileaks have demonstrated that all of the imperialist wars in the Middle East were based on lies. Only last week, Wikileaks released documents revealing serious objections from within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to the watchdog group\u2019s public report of 2019 that blamed Syria\u2019s Assad government for an alleged chlorine gas attack on the Syrian city of Douma in April 2018. The files released by Wikileaks not only suggest that evidence of a chemical attack was planted, but that photos of alleged victims, showing people foaming at the mouth, indicate these people exhibited signs of exposure to sarin gas, not chlorine. The Trump administration used the doctored OPCW report, released well after the fact, to justify the launching of a direct assault on Syria, where Russian forces were stationed in defense of the Assad regime. The attack could have triggered World War III.<\/p> <p>Exposures like this demonstrate just why the US ruling elite are so desperate to destroy Assange and whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning. It was Manning, then an Army private, who leaked over 750,000 classified and unclassified documents to Wikileaks implicating US forces in war crimes in Iraq, including the infamous \u201cCollateral Murder\u201d video. For her principled act, Manning was incarcerated and tortured in US military prisons. Although released in 2017, Manning is back in prison for refusing to testify against Assange.<\/p> <p>All defenders of democratic principles and rights should be concerned with the fates of Assange and Manning. A journalist and a whistleblower, they are being persecuted for revealing to the world the ugly truth about imperialist power.<\/p> <p>But why should teachers in particular come to their defense?<\/p> <p>As teachers know well, public education is under attack, in the US and internationally. This attack is not simply a matter of governmental cost cutting or the privatization of education through for-profit charter schools. The attack on education is an attack on the working class and especially the youth. A government that serves the interests of a wealthy elite fears nothing so much as truth, and the prospect of a truly educated population, capable of dismantling lies and discerning truth, is anathema to such a government. The persecution of Assange and Manning is part of this attack on truth and the working class.<\/p> <p>From overcrowded classrooms to outdated textbooks, from inadequate pay and benefits to dumbed-down curricula, teachers see firsthand the means by which the ruling elite carry out their war on public education. They have also seen how this war has been prosecuted by Democrats and Republicans alike, by Barack Obama and Arne Duncan as surely as by Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.<\/p> <p>Teachers have fought back valiantly in defense of education, not only in their everyday work in the classroom but over the past two years in the form of city-wide and even statewide strikes. These strikes have put demands for quality of education on a par with demands for better pay and benefits, and for this reason have seen overwhelming support from students and parents. But they have not been supported by the politically bankrupt teachers\u2019 unions, which are part of the apparatus of the elite and whose chief purpose is to provide an ever-cheaper work force and to prevent strikes. Predictably, the unions have failed to issue any support to Assange and Manning, but instead are lining up behind various pro-war Democratic candidates for president.<\/p> <p>It is up to teachers to continue the struggle for education and truth, and this means a struggle independent of the traitorous unions. Teachers must form their own rank-and-file committees and join ranks with a whole new generation of students looking for a path of struggle against war and censorship.<\/p> <p>The defense of the courageous Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning is a responsibility of the working class. His persecution is our persecution, his struggle for truth is our struggle for truth. Teachers should take their place in this fight to defend the democratic rights of the whole working class and a future for the next generation.<\/p> <p>Fraternally,<\/p> <p>James McDonald<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3VADEH0UHECZKEB383LVAYW6NNGPSO"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":461,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","torture"],"year":"2018.0","month":"April","date":null,"city":"Douma","region":"None","country":"Syria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, Britain, extradition, Belmarsh","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chelsea Manning","victim_keywords":"whistleblower, army private, wikileaks, Collateral Murder, arrested, torture","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"chlorine gas attack, Syria, Douma, civilians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","torture"],"year":"2018.0","month":"April","date":null,"city":"Douma","region":"None","country":"Syria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, Britain, extradition, Belmarsh","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chelsea Manning","victim_keywords":"whistleblower, army private, wikileaks, Collateral Murder, arrested, torture","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"chlorine gas attack, Syria, Douma, civilians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":999344652,"Input.title":"Ex Royal Marine Commando refuses to leave his workers behind in Kabul","Input.publish_date":"2021-08-14 23:23:42+01:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>A former Royal Marine commando who runs a charity in Kabul has vowed to stay on until he can secure British visas for his Afghan staff.<\/p> <p>Paul \u2018Pen\u2019 Farthing said he refuses to leave his local workers, who fear they will be killed by the Taliban for working with Westerners.<\/p> <p>Mr Farthing, 52, served in Helmand and saw two of his comrades killed fighting the group who are now perilously close to the capital.<\/p> <p>Paul \u2018Pen\u2019 Farthing said he refuses to leave his local workers, who fear they will be killed by the Taliban for working with Westerners<\/p> <p>The former Royal Marine Commando, pictured, runs an animal welfare charity in Kabul employing local workers, who are now facing torture and death for assisting a westerner<\/p> <p>Speaking as panic-stricken Westerners fled, the veteran spoke of his anger towards Britain and America for abandoning the Afghan people to the \u2018medieval\u2019 regime.<\/p> <p>\u2018This should never have happened,\u2019 he said. \u2018The West should hang its head in shame.<\/p> <p>\u2018Boris Johnson should be absolutely ashamed of what we have done.

The ant left, he said, but in about an hour and a half thousands of them were in his cell.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt was the first time in so long that I had the contact of anybody or anything,\u201d he told the crowd, his voice catching.<\/p> <p>But Ching, who was born in Hawaii and attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has revealed little about what landed him behind bars.<\/p> <p>In what authorities called a \u201cheinous\u201d and \u201csophisticated\u201d crime, Ching and several accomplices abducted a man who had stolen $60,000 in a drug deal, bound his hands and drove him to a hotel, where they removed his pants and beat him at length, court records show.<\/p> <p>Corrections officials said he served nine years and seven months in prison for kidnapping and causing great bodily injury. Valarie Ianniello, former executive director of the foundation, said Ching told her he spent 11 months in solitary confinement. A California prisons spokeswoman said there was no record he was ever placed in any type of solitary housing.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Ching did not dispute the lack of such a record, but he said in an email to The Times: \u201cMy experience is my experience. And because your definition of confinement differs from mine, that does not make my experience not true.\u201d<\/p> <p>Two years after his release in 2010, Ching registered his pet food business and the Animal Hope & Wellness Foundation with the state. He describes himself as a fourth-generation herbalist and nutritionist. He also opened the Petstaurant store on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. In 2015, Ching began making regular trips to Asia and posting disturbing images on social media.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Asia once I watched them crucify dogs\u2026. They would get their paws and they would nail gun them into walls.\u201d \u2014 Marc Ching, in a BuzzFeed interview<\/p> <p>Ching speaks at the 2017 Circle V Festival in Los Angeles. (Tommaso Boddi \/ Getty Images)<\/p> <p>He soon became something of a media darling, telling harrowing tales of being assaulted, threatened with a machete, shot at and nearly killed while uncovering animal abuse overseas.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Asia once I watched them crucify dogs,\u201d he said on camera in a 2016 BuzzFeed interview, his eyes red and wet with tears. \u201cThey would get their paws and they would nail gun them into walls.\u201d (Ching did not respond to requests from The Times for any documentation or further details of this incident and the more serious of the alleged assaults against him.)<\/p> <p>He added: \u201cI have videos of hangings, burning them alive, boiling alive, cutting their feet off while they\u2019re still alive, strangulation.\u201d<\/p> <p>Valarie Ianniello, former executive director of Ching\u2019s foundation, said he grew accustomed to the hero treatment. \u201cThe money came in, and it helped build his business up,\u201d she said. (Al Seib \/ Los Angeles Times)<\/p> <p>The segment has been viewed more than 3.9 million times. Viewers praised him online as a hero. Contributions to his foundation surged \u2014 from about $110,000 in 2015 to nearly $2 million the next year, according to the charity\u2019s tax records.<\/p> <p>\u201cI think he recognized that he could be worshiped by this stuff,\u201d Ianniello said. \u201cThe money came in, and it helped build his business up.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ching has opened a second Petstaurant on the Westside.<\/p> <p>::<\/p> <p>There is no dispute that dogs and cats are killed for food in countries across Asia, especially outside the major cities. Local activists in those countries have long fought to end the practice, often working in league with Westerners.<\/p> <p>Foreign and U.S. activists interviewed by The Times said the methods used by butchers to round up and kill the animals \u2014 packing them into cages, drowning them, clubbing them on the head and, in some cases, hanging them \u2014 are uniformly inhumane.<\/p> <p>They said there had been instances when animal abusers burned dogs alive or brutalized them in other ways, and images of the cruelty are posted online. And there have been many times when butchers, after striking a dog\u2019s skull to kill it, burn the animal to de-fur it, even though it is still alive.<\/p> <p>But all of the activists, including seven who do work in Asia, said their efforts had found no evidence to support the notion that the dogs are routinely and deliberately burned or boiled alive, or tortured with beatings and mutilations on a regular basis as Ching has described.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen animals boiled alive, never seen animals beaten or paws cut or anything,\u201d said Lee Fox-Smith, an author who co-founded the Campaign to End the Dog Meat Trade in Cambodia. Since 2017, Fox-Smith said, he has visited more than 200 slaughterhouses and restaurants that serve dog meat.<\/p> <p>He said he initially was afraid to investigate the meat trade because he had heard Ching\u2019s tales of danger. But when he started visiting slaughterhouses, he said, he found that they were the \u201ccomplete opposite\u201d of Ching\u2019s portrayals.<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t chasing you with machetes and guns,\u201d Fox-Smith said.<\/p> <p>He said he first contacted Ching through Facebook in 2018 and offered to help Ching\u2019s foundation shelter dogs rescued in Cambodia. They met twice in that country, Fox-Smith said, and he questioned Ching during the second meeting about Ching\u2019s claim that dogs were boiled alive in Cambodia.<\/p> <p>Fox-Smith said Ching told him, \u201cThey don\u2019t really torture the dogs in Cambodia.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s basically taking the most vulnerable animals in our society and exploiting them \u2026 and it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Fox-Smith said.<\/p> <p>He said Ching was cagey in answering other questions and declined to disclose the locations of slaughterhouses he had visited, making it impossible for Fox-Smith to verify Ching\u2019s claims.<\/p> <p>A still from the video shows butcher Marthen Wondang flashing a thumbs up toward the camera. \u201cThis is exactly what you want, right?\u201d he is heard asking in a local language as a dog is torched. (Image from video obtained by The Times)<\/p> <p>At the market in Tomohon, Indonesia, butchers gave The Times a much different account of the dog torched than Ching offered in his court declaration. They said Ching specifically wanted the dog burned alive, something they and others insisted was not normally done at the market.<\/p> <p>In the raw footage The Times obtained, a man is seen pulling the dog from a cage by its neck. Marthen Wondang, a butcher, moments later takes the dog, hanging from a noose, through the market.<\/p> <p>Someone yells out about a demonstration as Wondang carries the dog to a patch of dirt where chickens are underfoot.<\/p> <p>As the dog tries to escape, Wondang twice throws a rock at its head, subduing it before hanging the animal from a wooden cane. Another butcher starts to blowtorch the dog, which thrashes about in agony. Wondang looks toward the camera and flashes a thumbs up. In a language local to the area, he asks a question whose English translation is, \u201cThis is exactly what you want, right?\u201d<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>A minute and 19 seconds into the burning, the dog, its body charred, lets out its final whimper.<\/p> <p>\u00d7 Butchers in Indonesia told The Times that animal rights activist Marc Ching paid them to hang and burn a dog alive \u2014 a method of killing more cruel than any they say they normally employ \u2014 so he could stage the scene for the camera. Ching denied doing so, and his foundation questioned the butchers\u2019 credibility, saying his work threatened their livelihoods.<\/p> <p>The market has earned a grisly reputation thanks to social media and animal welfare campaigns.<\/p> <p>In one section under brightly colored tarpaulins, vendors hawk local favorites such as smoked skipjack tuna, spiky golden pineapples and tropical jeruk manis oranges that turn green when ripened.<\/p> <p>The center of the bazaar features rats impaled on bamboo sticks, listless reticulated pythons coiled into mounds and charred bats, mouths agape and showing off rows of fangs and thick, pointy tongues. The smell is a noxious mix of cigarette smoke, unrefrigerated meat and kerosene from blowtorches singeing away dead animal hair.<\/p> <p>Dogs are kept in small cages on wheels before they\u2019re slaughtered, their tails tucked between their hind legs and faces withdrawn with droopy eyes.<\/p> <p>Several butchers in Ching\u2019s videos told a Times reporter on a recent visit to the market that they met Ching when he showed up with an interpreter in 2016, saying he wanted to buy dog meat. Wondang said Ching bought four dogs at an inflated price and asked that they be killed in particular ways, including torching one alive, while he recorded video.<\/p> <p>Ching \u201cwas smiling and laughing throughout the process \u2026 like he was happy.\u201d \u2014 Marthen Wondang, butcher<\/p> <p>Wondang and the other butchers said they typically killed dogs by beating them on the head. Burning dogs to death, they said, would be too costly in terms of kerosene and more likely to result in the butchers getting bitten or scratched.<\/p> <p>Strangely, Wondang said, Ching left the dog meat behind after he finished recording.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cHe was smiling and laughing throughout the process,\u201d he said of Ching. \u201cLike he was happy.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ching did not respond to a question about that claim. He said one of the butchers, whom he did not identify, told him in 2016 that they burned 50 dogs to death a day at the market.<\/p> <p>In interviews with The Times, animal welfare activists based in Europe and Asia said some of the butchers had given them the same account of Ching paying to have the dog burned alive on camera. They said the butchers told them this separately at various times between late 2017 and spring 2018, well before The Times began its investigation.<\/p> <p>Lola Webber, Bali-based co-founder and director of the Change for Animals Foundation, a charity registered in England, told The Times she visited the Tomohon market around Christmas 2017. She said \u201cmaybe three\u201d butchers, including one she recognized from Ching\u2019s videos, together approached her group asking whether they were with Ching. Webber said she told them no.<\/p> <p>A dog lies inside a cage at the Tomohon market. (Ronny Adolof Buol \/ For The Times)<\/p> <p>The butchers related that Ching had paid them to torture the dogs on camera in certain ways \u2014 one hanged, another torched alive, Webber said.<\/p> <p>She said she had a similar experience when she visited a meat market in nearby Langowan. About five butchers walked up to her group and asked whether they were associated with Ching, she said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe said, \u2018No, we have nothing to do with Marc Ching,\u2019\u201d Webber added. \u201cThey said, \u2018Do you want to pay us?\u2019\u201d<\/p> <p>Webber said Ching\u2019s actions undermined the work of activists devoted to ending the dog meat trade, which kills dogs in ways that are cruel enough. \u201cIt\u2019s totally shameful,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Frank Manus manages Animal Friends Manado Indonesia, which operates a shelter in Tomohon. He said that during a brief meeting in 2016, Ching showed him photos of a dog being burned alive at the Tomohon market. Manus said he immediately doubted the photos.<\/p> <p>Frank Manus, who manages an Indonesian animal rescue organization, said he immediately doubted the photos Ching showed him of a dog being burned alive in Tomohon: \u201cI go to the market every day, and no such thing happens.\u201d (Ronny Adolof Buol \/ For The Times)<\/p> <p>\u201cI go to the market every day, and no such thing happens,\u201d Manus said.<\/p> <p>Other activists have questioned Ching\u2019s videos. He sued one of them: Deborah Hall, a volunteer who posted on Facebook that Ching \u201cpaid to have dogs torched and legs cut off,\u201d according to the suit. A judge tossed the part of the lawsuit concerning that statement. Hall declined to comment on the suit, which the parties eventually settled.<\/p> <p>Sebastian Margenfeld, a German activist, said he first learned of Ching in 2016 when he stumbled upon a YouTube video on Ching\u2019s rescues in Asia. He said it moved him so much that he reached out to Ching\u2019s charity with the goal of producing a public service announcement, or PSA, in German similar to the foundation\u2019s, using the same footage.<\/p> <p>Soon after, Margenfeld said, he started his own foundation with a name that echoes that of Ching\u2019s charity when translated into English. Margenfeld said the early web postings of his foundation focused on Ching\u2019s work. He added that his foundation later contributed more than $50,000 in funds and services to Ching\u2019s efforts, including the cost of flying American veterinarians to China.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>In the meantime, he said, Ching\u2019s foundation put him in touch with the production company that created its PSA, Sugar Studios LA, which sent Margenfeld a zip file in November 2016 with Ching\u2019s raw footage.<\/p> <p>Margenfeld said he watched it all. He offered to join Ching on rescue missions, but Ching always refused the help.<\/p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he visited Indonesian slaughterhouses in April 2018 to shoot his own footage that he began to question Ching\u2019s footage, Margenfeld said.<\/p> <p>\u201cBecause I had never been to Asian slaughterhouses, I thought it was real,\u201d he said of the torture. \u201cI went to Tomohon and it was so different from Ching\u2019s video.\u201d<\/p> <p>Margenfeld, who is a physical therapist in the town of Freiburg in southwest Germany, said he told the foundation board members of his suspicions about Ching in a May 2018 conference call. The board members stood by Ching, Margenfeld said.<\/p> <p>Times investigations Stories like this don\u2019t happen without your support.<\/p> <p>Subscribe today<\/p> <p>In 2016, Ching traveled to Cambodia with a professional cameraman to film more slaughterhouses. Raw footage from the trip features long monologues during bumpy car rides in which Ching chokes up as he reflects on what he says he witnessed.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe people that really hurt these animals, they\u2019re going to hurt children,\u201d he says during one ride. \u201cThey\u2019re going to molest kids, kidnap people, they\u2019re gonna beat them up.\u201d<\/p> <p>In one scene, Ching is kneeling beside a brick cage of dogs describing the meat trade for the camera.<\/p> <p>\u201cHow many dogs you want?\u201d his interpreter is heard asking him shortly after.<\/p> <p>Ching cuts him off by saying \u201cwhoa\u201d several times and \u201ctime out,\u201d while making a gesture to direct the cameraman to stop shooting. The cameraman points the camera down but keeps it rolling.<\/p> <p>Dressed in a black T-shirt lettered #CompassionProject with the foundation\u2019s web address, Ching says to the cameraman, \u201cYou know going undercover, they show us, just because as a dog meat buyer, usually, this guy is gonna tie one up, he\u2019s gonna hang one over here, and beat him.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cYou know, we\u2019re gonna cut him down so he doesn\u2019t kill the dog and stuff,\u201d he continues on the footage. \u201cSo are you OK documenting that stuff?\u201d<\/p> <p>Someone says, \u201cYeah.\u201d And Ching replies, \u201cI\u2019ll just do one then.\u201d<\/p> <p>After a few moments, the cameraman asks, \u201cDo you feel like this is necessary?\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d Ching replied. \u201cI\u2019d rather not document it\u2026. When I go undercover, I don\u2019t know, I like it better, because, like, it\u2019s just natural, you know. They\u2019re doing it already.\u201d<\/p> <p>A person familiar with the incident said Ching had arranged to have the slaughterhouse hang and beat the dog for the purpose of filming it. The person, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation by Ching, said the hanging and beating ultimately did not occur.<\/p> <p>\u00d7 A person familiar with the incident captured on this video clip said Ching had arranged to have the Cambodian slaughterhouse hang and beat the dog for the purpose of filming it. The person said the hanging and beating ultimately did not occur. Ching denied making any arrangement to harm a dog. An attorney for his foundation described the clip as a discussion about filming a \u201cdramatic reenactment\u201d of a previous hanging at the slaughterhouse, without harming the dog.<\/p> <p>Ching and two Los Angeles attorneys for his foundation offered a series of descriptions of the clip.<\/p> <p>Jeremy Gray, one of the lawyers, said in an email to The Times that the video from Cambodia \u201cappears to be a misleadingly doctored clip that is removed from its appropriate context.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Times engaged an audio-visual forensics expert in Michigan, Ed Primeau, to analyze the Cambodia footage. Primeau said he found no evidence that it had been altered.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese video recordings are authentic and represent the events as they occurred,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Ching later said in an email to The Times, \u201cIt is likely that the clip recorded a discussion about organizing the filming and that may have included some payment to enter the slaughterhouse.\u201d He said that there was no plan to mistreat a dog and that no animal was hurt.<\/p> <p>Selmont, the other attorney for the foundation, described the clip as a discussion about filming a \u201cdramatic reenactment\u201d of a previous hanging at the slaughterhouse without harming the dog.<\/p> <p>\u201cMr. Ching and the foundation ultimately decided against including anything like that in the documentary and the videographer himself has confirmed that no such event ever occurred,\u201d Selmont said in an email.<\/p> <p>Selmont said the earlier hanging occurred several months before the discussion on the clip: \u201cMr. Ching posted an iPhone video of him cutting down a dog that he saw in real time being hung at a dog butcher. Mr. Ching, at that exact moment, paid for the dog and filmed himself in real time cutting down that dog who otherwise [would] have been slaughtered for meat.\u201d<\/p> <p>The foundation\u2019s PSA includes a shot of Ching cutting a hanging dog free.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>In another clip from Cambodia, a young man in board shorts drops a live dog into a vat of scalding water. As the dog thrashes about, the man quickly jumps back to avoid getting splashed. Moments later, the vat falls over as the dog tries to escape.<\/p> <p>Activists told The Times that dogs are not normally boiled alive in Cambodia, if only because the butchers could be scalded in the attempt. They said those vats were often used instead to de-fur dead dogs in boiling water. In the background of the Cambodia clip, a second young worker is seen removing the fur from what appears to be a dead dog in a similar tub of steaming water.<\/p> <p>On numerous occasions, Ching claimed that his life was in danger in Asia. When first asked for details by The Times, Ching responded with written descriptions of two car crashes, getting into altercations in Cambodia and China, being punched in the face in Korea, various encounters with butchers who threatened but did not injure him, and being pushed off a \u201csmall cliff\u201d in Taiji, Japan.<\/p> <p>The Times then presented Ching with information from media interviews and social media posts in which he is quoted as saying that, in addition to several assaults, he was shot at, had a machine gun stuck in his mouth and almost died four times. Ching responded that he had tried to suppress his memories of those incidents \u2014 which he has said occurred in recent years \u2014 because of their traumatic nature.<\/p> <p>\u201cThose things happened to me,\u201d Ching said in an email. \u201cOver the years both intentionally and I believe subconsciously I have tried to forget the worst of these experiences as it is best for my mental health.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ianniello, the foundation\u2019s former executive director, said Ching told her of an incident in which he was pushed to the ground at a slaughterhouse, where he swallowed feces and blood. Ching said that as a result he contracted flesh-eating bacteria that required surgery to eliminate, according to Ianniello and another former foundation employee, Kiana Kang.<\/p> <p>Ching did not respond to a Times query about the incident. He would not provide The Times with any documentation or other means of verifying the more serious episodes, such as medical records or the names of any witnesses. His foundation said in an email that Ching never reported the assaults to Asian authorities or to American diplomatic officials because doing so \u201cwould have affected the mission of the trips.\u201d<\/p> <p>Pringle and Tchekmedyian reported from Los Angeles, and Pierson reported from Indonesia.

Historians have now shown how this could happen. \u2018It was scandal management rather than prevention,\u2019 says Leiden historian and research leader Gert Oostindie.<\/p> <p>In their publication Over de grens (Over the Border) the 17 authors have presented their main conclusions: Dutch troops used extreme violence such as executions, torture and torching villages more often than was thought. The violence was systematic and went unchecked. The reason: the war against the Republic of Indonesia had to be won and the Netherlands wanted to be in charge of the decolonisation process, say the researchers.<\/p> <p>Gert Oostindie, Professor of Colonial and Postcolonial History, is the first author of the book. As former director of KITLV\/Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, he initiated the programme together with the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (NIOD) and the Netherlands Institute of Military History (NIMH). Various Leiden historians worked on the programme (see below) and a total of 14 books will be published. In an interview, Oostindie explains how they approached the research.<\/p> <p>Intimidation and violence against Indonesian citizens. NIMH collection.<\/p> <p>In recent years several studies have been published on this topic. What was missing?<\/p> <p>\u2018This decolonisation war was the Netherlands\u2019 biggest 20th-century war. There are libraries full of books about what the Germans did to us, but until recently we could barely fill a bookshelf on this war. This is why we called for a major study in 2012. There were hardly any studies at the time, but more have appeared recently. At the end of the 1960s, there were revelations about extreme violence. In 1969, the government took the stance that there had been excesses, but that the armed forces had behaved correctly as a whole. Thanks in part to the dissertation by R\u00e9my Limpach, who was on this research team, and also because of other studies such as my book \u2018Soldaat in Indonesi\u00eb\u2019 [Soldier in Indonesia, ed.] there were more and more signs that the Dutch armed forces were guilty of systematically using extreme violence, but by no means everything had been properly investigated. We have now reconstructed attitudes to violence in the whole chain: from the armed forces and especially the commanding officers to lawyers and politicians.\u2019<\/p> <p>\u2018Some wrote that the violence was unacceptable whereas others wrote that nothing happened or that such violence was unavoidable.\u2019<\/p> <p>How could the cover-up culture be so persistent?<\/p> <p>\u2018There was clear evidence of scandal management, as the study of the dynamics during the war shows. Reports of extreme violence by Dutch soldiers were minimised and covered up. We based our information on archive material such as from the intelligence services and security services and the minutes of the Council of Ministers. And a book is now being published about the post-war trend: people didn\u2019t want to hear it. What played an increasingly important role after the war was that at all levels people wanted to take account of the feelings of the veterans and the Indonesian community in Dutch society.\u2019<\/p> <p>What else came to light?<\/p> <p>\u2018A number of matters had never been properly investigated, such as how and why artillery and bombardments were used. This showed that the armed forces deliberately took risks and took little or no account of civilian casualties. The number of Indonesian dead is often estimated at over 100,000, compared to a few thousand Dutch war dead. This also points to extreme violence. Our research has also given a better impression of the work of the security services and how the military justice system worked. We\u2019ve gained a broader, more in-depth picture and this also adds more nuance to the story. For instance, that there was a lot of fighting in certain parts of the archipelago, but not in others.\u2019<\/p> <p>Was a lot of new source material studied?<\/p> <p>\u2018Yes, this involved on the one hand more thorough research of known Dutch government archives and on the other a lot of new archive material, such as documents from the Dutch secret service, who confiscated texts and photos, for instance, when they arrested Indonesians. These documents say more about the Indonesian side of the story. They ended up in the National Archive and some are also in the KITLV collections at the University Library in Leiden. We also show this in the online exhibition Images of the Indonesian War of Independence at the University Library.<\/p> <p>The Dutch intelligence service at work.<\/p> <p>\u2018The publicity surrounding this research has meant that new sources from private individuals have also surfaced, such as grandad\u2019s letters or diaries from the attic. These kinds of personal stories are an important addition to the official sources, which are incomplete because little was allowed to be reported. They show how diverse people\u2019s views were: some reflect frankly on the violence and write how they thought it was unacceptable. Others write that nothing happened or that such violence is unavoidable in a war.\u2019<\/p> <p>When did the political tide start to turn?<\/p> <p>\u2018An important political turning point was in 2005, sixty years after Soekarno declared Indonesian independence, when Minister of Foreign Affairs Ben Bot said in Jakarta: we were on the wrong side of history. We shouldn\u2019t have waged that war. But at the time nothing was said about how that war was waged. We wanted to research this further and the government earmarked over four million euros for this in 2017, as co-funding but not commissioning party.\u2019<\/p> <p>A few years ago the Indonesian government wasn\u2019t keen on this research taking place.<\/p> <p>\u2018The government did indeed indicate that didn\u2019t think it necessary because they wanted to look ahead. For Indonesia, it was clear: you had no right to occupy us and we kicked you out during the war. But this research is first and foremost about finding the truth about Dutch history. To face up to the fact that we as a nation have a rosy self-image that is often at odds with how the Netherlands behaved. Incidentally, there is a difference between the position of the Indonesian government and the interest in society there and among historians. They are also looking for nuance in the official story, which was rather monolithic, when there was just as much division in society there in 1945-1949.\u2019<\/p> <p>How was the collaboration with Indonesian historians?<\/p> <p>\u2018They provided new insights, in the use of terminology alone. The research programme is now called Onafhankelijkheid, Dekolonisatie, Geweld en Oorlog (Independence, Decolonisation, Violence and War). The term independence wasn\u2019t included initially. That\u2019s not surprising because in an international academic work the term \u201cdecolonisation war\u201d is customary and we used it very deliberately in response to the framing as police action. But Indonesian historians asked: why does the title begin with decolonisation? We were already decolonised on 17 August 1945 because that was when we became independent.\u2019<\/p> <p>\u2018For Indonesia, it was clear: you had no right to occupy us and we kicked you out during the war.\u2019<\/p> <p>King Willem Alexander apologised in 2020 for the Dutch actions in Indonesia. What will Prime Minister Rutte do now?<\/p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s crystal clear that the government position from 1969 is incompatible with what we know now. So I think it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019ll say something, but what that is I don\u2019t know. That really is a political matter.\u2019<\/p> <p>You recently retired. How has the discussion about the colonial past changed in recent decades?<\/p> <p>\u2018There\u2019s a much more critical view of the colonial past, also in countries like France and England. I started out researching Latin America and the Caribbean. There, but here too, there was no doubt that the colonial period was incredibly violent and racist \u2013 take the decimation of the indigenous population and the introduction of African slavery, for example. But people in the Netherlands looked at Indonesia in a different, more nostalgic way and it was harder to come to terms with this violent past. It\u2019s good that we\u2019ve reached that point and people will hopefully see the power of this research. But we\u2019re not there yet. Much more Dutch than Indonesian material has been studied and ideally Dutch and Indonesian historians will continue this together. Most insights come about when researchers look at the same sources from different perspectives.\u2019<\/p> <p>Several historians from Leiden worked on this national research programme, from the KITLV and the University, such as NIMH director Ben Schoenmaker, a professor by special appointment in Leiden.

Fanny Hedenmo  Fanny Hedenmo<\/p> <p>(Tunis, December 28, 2019) \u2013 Moroccan authorities should unconditionally release and drop charges against a journalist jailed for a 9 months-old tweet criticizing a judge, Human Rights Watch said today. Omar Radi, 33, is due to be tried on January 2, 2020 for allegedly insulting a judge who imposed heavy penalties on protesters from the Rif region. He faces up to one year in prison if convicted.<\/p> <p>On December 26, a judge in Casablanca rejected Radi\u2019s request for pretrial release, notably on medical grounds that he suffers a severe form of asthma and other ailments.<\/p> <p>\u201cCriticizing officials is protected speech and no one should face prison time for peacefully doing so,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cMoroccan authorities should immediately free Omar Radi and drop their case against him, which reeks of political vengeance against his critical journalism and activism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Radi, an award-winning investigative journalist, published several articles about the corruption of officials, and collaborated with various international media as a local correspondent or stringer. Radi is also a social and economic rights activist who has been active in various nongovernmental organizations, notably defending freedom of the press and land rights. He was vice president of Attac Maroc, the local branch of an anti-globalization organization that promotes civic action in response to perceived excesses of global capitalism. He recently described to the Committee to Protect Journalists the \u201cclimate of pervasive surveillance and harassment\u201d faced by Moroccan journalists.<\/p> <p>On April 6, Radi tweeted \u201cLet us all remember Appeals Judge Lahcen Tolfi, the enforcer against our brothers. In many regimes, small-time henchmen like him come back begging, later, claiming they were only \u2018carrying out orders.\u2019 No forgetting or forgiveness with such undignified officials!\u201d Radi tweeted this minutes after an appeals court, presided by Tolfi, upheld the trial court\u2019s verdicts against the leaders of largely peaceful protests in the Rif region, who were sentenced in June 2018 to up to 20 years in prison, largely based on statements that they said were made under police torture.<\/p> <p>On April 16, police in Casablanca summoned Radi and interrogated him for four hours about a series of tweets he posted, criticizing a magazine feature profiling Judge Tolfi that Radi found overly favorable. The police did not contact Radi again until December 25, when they sent him a new summons. When he reported the next morning at 9 a.m., the police transported him to the office of a prosecutor in the Ain Sebaa Court in Casablanca. At 1 p.m., the prosecutor began questioning Radi in the company of his four lawyers. One of them, Omar Bendjelloun, told Human Rights Watch that the 30-minute session revolved solely around the single April 6 tweet about Judge Tolfi. At around 2 p.m., the prosecutor charged Radi with \u201cinsulting a magistrate\u201d under penal code article 263 and ordered his detention and immediate referral to trial. Radi was taken to a cell in the basement of the courthouse. His trial started at 6 p.m. Human Rights Watch attended the trial session.<\/p> <p>The defense immediately requested a postponement of the case and Radi\u2019s provisional release. The prosecutor argued that detention was necessary because of unspecified \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that he said surrounded Radi\u2019s case. The judge rejected the petition for provisional release and ordered Radi\u2019s transfer to Oukacha prison in Casablanca. The next trial session is scheduled for January 2.<\/p> <p>Article 263 of Morocco\u2019s penal code punishes with one month to one year in prison and a fine to \u201cwhoever, with the intention of damaging their honor, their delicacy or the respect due to their authority, shows contempt to \u2026 a magistrate.\u201d<\/p> <p>Morocco has been a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) since 1979. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors state compliance with the ICCPR, stated in its general comment on the right to freedom of expression that the \u201cmere fact that forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify the imposition of penalties.\u201d Thus, \u201call public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority \u2026 are legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition.\u201d<\/p> <p>In the past two months, Morocco has arrested, jailed, or sentenced a rapper, two YouTube commentators, and a student who posted the lyrics of a critical rap song on Facebook.

The Burundian authorities should demonstrate their commitment to protecting human rights by immediately releasing Nkina and dropping all the charges against him. Burundi's international partners should support the calls for his release.<\/p> <p>Nkina, a lawyer in Kayanza province in northern Burundi, was arrested on October 13, 2020, in Kabarore commune, where he was visiting a client for his professional work. He was briefly detained by the intelligence service in Kayanza, then transferred to police detention, and finally to Ngozi prison, where he is currently detained.<\/p> <p>October 2020 was a tense period in Kayanza following attacks by an armed group in the previous weeks, with several people killed or abducted. Nkina happened to visit Kabarore, one of the areas affected, soon after these attacks. The authorities accused him of collaborating with the armed opposition group RED-Tabara (Resistance for the Rule of Law in Burundi), which they hold responsible for the attacks, and charged him with endangering internal state security.<\/p> <p>On June 15, 2021, the court of Kayanza convicted Nkina of \"collaboration with rebels who attacked Burundi,\" and sentenced him to five years in prison and a fine of one million Burundian francs (approximately US$ 500). His client, Apollinaire Hitimana, whom he had been advising on a land dispute and was arrested with him, was found guilty of complicity in the same offence and sentenced to two and a half years and a fine of 500,000 Burundian francs. An appeal hearing is scheduled for August 12, at the Ngozi court of appeal.<\/p> <p>Nkina was APRODH's representative in Kayanza until the government suspended the organization in 2015 as part of a larger crackdown on civil society over opposition to President Pierre Nkurunziza running for a controversial third term. He has not worked for APRODH or any other Burundian civil society organization for the past six years. He is a well-known lawyer in Kayanza and a member of the Gitega bar. However, authorities in Kayanza may still associate him with APRODH, especially as he was riding his former APRODH motorcycle on the day of his arrest.<\/p> <p>The prosecution accused him, among other things, of travelling to Rwanda to give information to APRODH's president, Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, who lives in Europe, as well as to RED-Tabara. The prosecution has not presented any evidence to substantiate these allegations.<\/p> <p>Nkina is the only known former staff member of a human rights organization imprisoned in Burundi at the present time. Two other human rights defenders were released earlier in 2021.<\/p> <p>For further details about the government repression of human rights activists, please see below.<\/p> <p>Background<\/p> <p>APRODH was one of Burundi's most active and best-known human rights organizations. Mbonimpa narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 2015 with life-threatening injuries. Mbonimpa's son and his son-in-law were both shot dead in 2015.<\/p> <p>APRODH's representative in Gitega province, Nestor Nibitanga, was arrested in 2017 and sentenced in 2018 to five years in prison on charges similar to those brought against Nkina. He was released in April as part of President \u00c9variste Ndayishimiye's pardon of more than 5,000 prisoners.<\/p> <p>Another human rights defender, Germain Rukuki, was arrested in 2017 and sentenced to 32 years in prison in 2018 on trumped-up charges related to his human rights work. His sentence was confirmed by the appeal court in 2019, but the appeal court's decision was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court. The appeal court reduced his sentence to one year in June 2021. He was released the same month.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Human Rights Legal Affairs NGO By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

It directed state actors, including security agencies, to take measures necessary to maintain law and order and protect citizens\u2019 lives and property. They were also asked to keep essential public services working, and direct relief materials to the areas of greatest need. State actors enforced restrictions on movement and travel, bans on public gatherings, and closure of markets, businesses and schools.<\/p> <p>Despite the warning by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that states should not violate human rights under the guise of exceptional or emergency measures, some actions of Nigerian security agencies violated the rights of informal workers. Of particular concern were those whose survival depends on daily earnings from outside the home. These include street vendors, petty traders, artisans, cart pushers, waste pickers, commercial motorcycle operators, and roadside motor mechanics.<\/p> <p>The pandemic and the related containment measures worsened various forms of social, cultural and economic exclusion and inequality. This strongly affected vulnerable groups like informal workers.<\/p> <p>Some states in Nigeria such as Abia, Ekiti, Lagos, Kaduna and Rivers recorded incidents of abuse such as destruction of traders\u2019 wares by security operatives enforcing the lockdown policy. Cases were reported where security agencies were implicated in harassment, killings, maiming and torture.<\/p> <p>Public transport services were shut down, leading to loss of income. Informal workers were left with little option than to walk long distances between their homes and places of work. Many who dared to move around were harassed and arrested by the security agencies. These impacts have been captured in media reports.<\/p> <p>The lockdown policy severely reduced income-generating activities for informal workers and presented the dilemma of either \u2018dying from the virus or dying from hunger\u2019.<\/p> <p>Nigeria has a Bill of Rights, and these rights are contained in Chapter IV of the 1999 constitution. They include the right to life, right to dignity, right to personal liberty, right to freedom of movement, and right to freedom of assembly and association. State actors violated these rights under lockdown.<\/p> <p>How state actors got it wrong<\/p> <p>While the Nigeria Police issued some guidelines on enforcement of COVID-19 control measures, it left room for discretionary use of force.<\/p> <p>The guidelines prescribed \u201cuse of force when absolutely necessary and to the extent proportionate to achieve the required result and in accordance with existing national legislation.\u201d They didn\u2019t consider the daily income earners who cannot survive without leaving their homes. Consequently, many Nigerians who obeyed the COVID-19 lockdown policy did not have food and income that their families needed.<\/p> <p>The lockdown also closed schools and disrupted students\u2019 education. While the children of the elite took online lessons and used digital platforms for learning, the children of informal workers had no such opportunity.<\/p> <p>COVID-19 containment programmes raised important legal, constitutional and human rights concerns.<\/p> <p>What we suggest<\/p> <p>Any future lockdown strategies must consider the risks to both lives and livelihoods. Approaches like lockdown and stay-at-home orders may not benefit societies dominated by informal economies.<\/p> <p>We argue that the enforcement of COVID-19 containment policies in Nigeria neglected social structures and the way the local economy works. It undermined the human rights of informal workers who depend on daily social interactions for their livelihood.<\/p> <p>The nuances of culture also should be taken into consideration before large scale adoption of these control practices. And security agents need training on human rights as part of effective implementation of COVID-19 containment measures in Nigeria.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"35XW21VSVIT9TTW5GBSOTHNMIDFSLT"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":995,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Lockdown, citizens, arrest, torture","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Lockdown, citizens, arrest, torture","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1026882858,"Input.title":"Olympics-Athlete hailed by Uyghur advocates for \u2018East Turkestan\u2019 flag","Input.publish_date":"2022-02-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By Karolos Grohmann and Mitch Phillips<\/p> <p>BEIJING (Reuters) \u2013 A ski jumper at the Winter Olympics was hailed by advocates for Uyghurs on Sunday after displaying what they said was the flag of the independence movement of East Turkestan, a group Beijing says threatens the stability of its Xinjiang region.<\/p> <p>Turkey\u2019s Fatih Arda Ipcioglu on Saturday competed in light blue-coloured skis with a white crescent and white star on them.

(AP Photo\/Rebecca Blackwell)<\/p> <p>The same week that the AFL-CIO called on the US to intervene in Matamoros, the Biden administration decided to file a separate labor complaint, also under the USMCA. It requested that the Mexican government of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (known as AMLO) review a fraudulent union recognition vote involving threats and ballot-stuffing by CTM gangsters, known as charros, aimed at maintaining the CTM\u2019s control over the contract at the General Motors factory in Silao, in the central state of Guanajuato.<\/p> <p>Workers in Mexico should be highly suspicious of these efforts. The same government in Washington is currently backing the massacre of Palestinian workers and children by Israeli bombs and the killing and \u201cdisappearing\u201d of hundreds of Colombian workers and youth by that country\u2019s police, who are trained and armed by the United States.<\/p> <p>The request by the Biden administration follows an earlier letter signed by US Representatives Dan Kildee, Bill Pascrell and Earl Blumenauer asking GM itself to \u201cspeak out against violations of labor and human rights abuses at the Silao GM plant.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Canadian trade union Unifor and the so-called IndustriAll Global Union also released letters to GM and Mexican government authorities denouncing the fraudulent vote at Silao.<\/p> <p>On May 11, the Mexican Labor Ministry acknowledged that it had found \u201cserious irregularities\u201d in the vote at Silao and would order the CTM affiliate to hold a new vote within 30 days to legitimize its contract with GM. The ministry also filed a complaint with state prosecutors, setting the stage for a possible criminal investigation.<\/p> <p>GM said it would hire a firm to conduct an \u201cindependent review\u201d of the allegations, but insisted that Labor Ministry inspectors had supervised the vote and conditions at the plant. However, according to workers at the plant who spoke to the WSWS, the Labor Ministry inspectors would meet only CTM union officials and workers that had been threatened and\/or bribed.<\/p> <p>Having ignored numerous previous complaints by GM workers at Silao, L\u00f3pez Obrador himself said last Wednesday that \u201cthe US government is right,\u201d adding that \u201cWe had confirmed it and it had been condemned.\u201d He then promised to respond to the US request \u201cimmediately.\u201d<\/p> <p>In a statement pledging to cooperate with the inquiry, the CTM directly addressed the real concerns of the ruling class. \u201cThe CTM does not generate conflicts,\u201d it declared, \u201cnor is it an obstacle for the development of industry and trade.\u201d<\/p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the AMLO government will assist the CTM and GM in carrying out another fraudulent vote fraud to renew their contract. That would require demonstrating majority support for the contract, with \u201cyes\u201d votes representing at least 30 percent of the total workforce. Alternately, AMLO might allow another registered trade union to negotiate and compete against the CTM for a separate contract.<\/p> <p>This validation process is a new requirement for all contracts under AMLO\u2019s \u201clabor reform,\u201d which incorporates the labor provisions of the USMCA. However, in the two years since the \u201creform\u201d took effect, AMLO has not only given a free hand to the CTM, but has continued, like past governments, to rely on its violent harassment and policing of workers to suppress their struggles.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Mexican Labor Minister Luisa Alcalde has insisted that it is acting in \u201cdaily coordination with US labor authorities,\u201d and that the 500,000 contracts in the country will most likely not be revalidated before the May 2023 deadline. Nor has the ministry given any sign that it intends to invest in the enforcement resources required to oversee all these procedures. When asked about the lack of enforcement of the labor reform, AMLO has simply said that he will not interfere in \u201cinternal\u201d union affairs.<\/p> <p>Far from the dawn of \u201cunion democracy\u201d in Mexico, or the crusade against CTM corruption that AMLO promised, the USMCA and his government\u2019s labor \u201creform\u201d program are aimed at extinguishing the fires of socialist internationalism wherever they erupt among Mexican workers influenced by the World Socialist Web Site. In addition to belonging to the one-million-strong auto workforce in Mexico, what the workers at Tridonex and Matamoros have in common is precisely their connection to the WSWS.<\/p> <p>The labor reform was rushed into law in May 2019 after tens of thousands of maquiladora workers organized wildcat strikes in opposition to the CTM. As analyzed by the WSWS in articles widely shared by Matamoros workers, Susana Prieto worked with US-aligned \u201cindependent unions\u201d to sideline the democratic strike committees and mass assemblies set up by the workers themselves. During a mass march to the nearby US border at Brownsville, Texas, the Matamoros strikers called on American workers to join their struggle and made numerous appeals to workers internationally, through the WSWS.<\/p> <p>After initially insisting that workers had to rely on the hated CTM union locals at Tridonex and other plants, Prieto and the Electricians Union (SME)\u2014both long-time collaborators of the AFL-CIO\u2014formed the SNITIS \u201cindependent\u201d union to channel and suppress the ongoing unrest.<\/p> <p>With billions of dollars in auto parts, electronics and defense products on the line in Matamoros, Prieto subsequently worked to contain new waves of wildcat strikes in 2020 by workers demanding shutdowns with full compensation when workers began falling ill with COVID-19. Prieto and SNITIS subordinated this struggle to AMLO\u2019s May 2020 decrees declaring all manufacturing to be \u201cessential.\u201d<\/p> <p>Then, in January 2021, SNITIS called on Matamoros plants to strike for a 15 percent wage increase. No plant won the full increase and dozens of workers were fired.<\/p> <p>Thousands more workers have been fired in reprisals for the strikes in 2019 and 2020. SNITIS, however, has refused to organize any struggle against the layoffs and firings. Instead, Prieto used the 2021 strikes as a stunt to announce her entry as a candidate of AMLO\u2019s Morena party in congressional elections to be held next month.<\/p> <p>A worker at the sugar processing factory Batory, who remained anonymous for fear of reprisal, told the WSWS that a group of workers fired in January sought help from Prieto, \u201cand she told them that they knew what they were getting into and refused to help them.\u201d The worker continued: \u201cNow they are sad and regret having listened to her. The activist Susana Prieto ended up being more charra than the [CTM] charros.\u201d<\/p> <p>At the GM plant in Silao, a group of rank-and-file workers called the Generating Movement, who had been fighting for years to rid themselves of the CTM, joined online calls organized by the WSWS with American autoworkers ahead of and during the September 2019 strike at GM in the United States. The Generating Movement workers acted courageously and in a principled manner to support the GM strikers in the US by refusing to go along with demands by GM at Silao for speedup and mandatory overtime. The company retaliated by carrying out numerous firings.<\/p> <p>Since this brave intervention, the AFL-CIO, the SME and other unions have sought to pressure the Generating Movement into organizing within one of the \u201cindependent\u201d unions vetted by the Mexican government and sponsored by US imperialism.<\/p> <p>In sum, the Mexican and US authorities, with the help of pseudo-left outfits, are employing the prospect of replacing the CTM goons by \u201cindependent\u201d charros sponsored by Washington to head off the struggle of workers to unite with their class brothers and sisters to the north and oppose capitalist exploitation.<\/p> <p>Within the United States, the complaints over union votes in Mexico coincide with an ongoing campaign by the Biden administration to prop up the existing trade unions, most recently by officially backing the unionization drive of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) at Amazon\u2019s Bessemer, Alabama, plant. Less than 13 percent voted for the union.<\/p> <p>This expression of opposition to the pro-corporate unions in the US coincides with the sentiments of workers at the Silao plant, who have voted by similar percentages to reject the CTM.<\/p> <p>For his part, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement: \u201cThe USMCA requires Mexico to end the reign of protection unions and their corrupt deals with employers.\u201d As Trumka himself well knows, if such a policy were enforced in the US, the AFL-CIO would be dissolved. As he was issuing this statement, a federal judge was sentencing Dennis Williams, former president of the United Auto Workers, to 21 months in jail for having stolen millions in union dues.<\/p> <p>Just as workers in Mexico face corruption, sellout contracts and harassment and violence by CTM charro officials, American workers confront similar conditions at the hands of the unions in the US. Nor is it any different for workers around the world.<\/p> <p>Promoting the myth being advanced around the USMCA labor provisions and Mexico\u2019s \u201clabor reform,\u201d the New York Times wrote: \u201cThe trade deal seeks to improve labor conditions and pay for workers in Mexico, which proponents say would benefit American workers by deterring factory owners from moving their operations to Mexico from the United States in search of cheaper labor.\u201d<\/p> <p>This narrative, while professing concern for workers, is based on the same reactionary and nationalist claims used by the AFL-CIO to divide American workers from their class brothers and sisters across the border, blaming Mexican workers for taking \u201cAmerican jobs.\u201d American workers, according to this narrative, must accept endless concessions in wages, pensions, health care and working conditions to prevent jobs from going abroad.<\/p> <p>By pitting workers against each other, the capitalist rulers have been able to slash real wages for workers on both sides of the border over the past four decades, as the maquiladoras in Mexico grew dramatically.<\/p> <p>Within the US, the Democratic Party is seeking to breathe new life into the rotten corpse of the AFL-CIO, which is entirely integrated into the state. Its foreign policy arm, the Solidarity Center, receives 96 percent of its funding from the State Department. Biden\u2019s point person for International Labor Affairs is Thea Lee, who was deputy chief of staff of the AFL-CIO between 1997 and 2017.<\/p> <p>The strategy of the US foreign policy establishment to promote \u201cindependent\u201d unions in Mexico dates back to 1997, when these unions first organized within the National Workers Union (UNT).

Now The Men Who Killed Ahmaud Arbery Face Hate Crime Charges.","Input.publish_date":"2022-01-26 20:23:11","Input.article_interface":"<p>In November, Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s family saw a glimpse of justice. Three men \u2014 Travis and Gregory McMichael, a father and son, and William Bryan \u2014 were all convicted for murdering the 25-year-old man in February 2020.<\/p> <p>But their quest is not over. The McMichaels and Bryan will face a hate crime trial in federal court on Feb. 7, when jury selection begins. The Department of Justice filed the charges last February, saying the McMichaels, who are white, targeted Arbery, a Black man, \u201cbecause of his race and color.\u201d<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>They face possible life sentences. The McMichaels already received life sentences without the possibility of parole for the murder, while Bryan was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis case is a litmus test as to where our judicial system is,\u201d Lee Merritt, the attorney for Arbery\u2019s family, told HuffPost. \u201cWe will have a chance to see the grisly facts and images the nation has become intimately familiar with, reconciled with the hate and ideology that motivated those actions.\u201d<\/p> <p>The trial will be a stark difference from the state trial, where prosecutors hinted at a racial motive but never presented evidence to that effect \u2014 even though some was available, including the alleged use of racial slurs during the murder. While Glynn County prosecutors stuck strictly to the mechanical facts of whether the three men unjustly took a life, federal prosecutors will seek a more profound judgment: one that says crimes motivated by prejudice should be considered a crime against the whole country.<\/p> <p>Arbery\u2019s death \u2014 and the subsequent long delay before charges were filed \u2014 did spark a wide conversation about how cheap Black life can be in America. \u201cThere is something so simple and tragic about a young man not even being able to run and jog in public in America,\u201d Brian Levin, a hate crime expert and attorney, said. \u201cIt is not only the tragedy and the loss of Arbery, it was mounting to the beginnings of a lynch mob.\u201d<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>A Different Legal Standard<\/p> <p>In Glynn County, the prosecution focused heavily on the legal standard of murder and Travis McMichael\u2019s claim that he was simply executing a citizen\u2019s arrest.<\/p> <p>Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, at times, made arguments that contained a slight \u2014 but never explicit \u2014 nod to racial animus on the part of the McMichaels and Bryan.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are here because of assumptions and driveway decisions. All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions. Not on facts, not on evidence. On assumptions,\u201d she said during opening statements.<\/p> <p>But the prosecution never introduced evidence, for example, that Bryan told law enforcement officials that Travis McMichael shouted out a racial slur toward Arbery after gunning him down, uttering, \u201cf***ing n****r\u201d after the shooting over Arbery\u2019s body. Defense lawyers asked prosecutors not to ask about it in court because Bryan was the only witness of the alleged incident.<\/p> <p>The judge presiding over the case heard arguments from lawyers on Friday about racist text messages and whether they should be admitted as evidence. The content of the messages is not clear, but Bryan\u2019s lawyer concedes they are \u201chighly inflammatory.\u201d He argued that disclosing the texts in court would unfairly sway Black jurors.<\/p> <p>Demonstrators march near the Glynn County Courthouse after the adjournment of daily court proceedings in the trial for the killers of Ahmaud Arbery on Nov. 18, 2021, in Brunswick, Georgia. Sean Rayford via Getty Images<\/p> <p>In May 2020, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requested a federal probe from the U.S. Department of Justice into Arbery\u2019s death.<\/p> <p>In the federal indictment, the McMichaels and Bryan are all charged with attempting to \u201cforcibly hold and detain Arbery against his will,\u201d which resulted in the young Black man\u2019s death. The three, also charged with kidnapping, are alleged to have restricted Arbery of his \u201cfree movement\u201d and \u201ccorral and detain him against his will, and prevent his escape.\u201d<\/p> <p>The hate crime charges focus on the motivations of the three men when they were chasing Arbery in broad daylight.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>The day Arbery was murdered was not the first time he was being chased, Merritt said. It was a reoccurring \u201chunt\u201d that resulted in the death of a young Black man. This was evident in the murder trial, as the McMichaels made 911 calls about a Black male walking in and out of a construction site months before Arbery was murdered.<\/p> <p>The legal system in Georgia will also face scrutiny. Merritt said the jury on the federal trial will hear \u201crevealing things\u201d about what Waycross Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill \u201cfelt about Black people.\u201d Barnhill recused himself from Arbery\u2019s case, but not before he wrote a letter to Glynn County police arguing that the three men shouldn\u2019t be arrested. He argued that the McMichaels were lawfully following a burglary suspect \u201cwith solid first hand probable cause.\u201d<\/p> <p>Barnhill was the second prosecutor to touch the case of Arbery\u2019s murder after former Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson recused herself from the case because she knew Gregory McMichael.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe already had the criminality of their actions adjudicated before the court of law. The federal charges are going after the terroristic aspect of their actions and the implications they had for Black people of this country,\u201d Merritt said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat is on trial now is not their behavior, but their reasoning for the behavior. This is an issue that has not been taken up yet, it is an issue of first impression.\u201d<\/p> <p>Shifting Laws Around Hate Crimes<\/p> <p>Before Arbery\u2019s murder, Georgia was one of four states without hate crime laws on the books. But that eventually changed.<\/p> <p>Georgia enacted a hate crime statute in June 2020, months after Arbery\u2019s death, and later repealed its citizen\u2019s arrest statute. The legislation imposes penalties for crimes that are motivated by a person\u2019s race, religion, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender or disability \u2014 but the McMichaels and Bryan could not be charged under it, since the law was not in place at the time of Arbery\u2019s murder.<\/p> <p>Forty-seven states now have hate crime statutes on the books. But bias motivations in hate crime statutes vary statewide. South Carolina, Wyoming and Arkansas are the only remaining states without hate crime laws.<\/p> <p>There are five federal hate crime statutes that federal prosecutors use when determining if a person should be charged with a hate crime.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is a bigger picture here, which is the history of this country with Black people being killed for racist motives.\u201d - Heidi Beirich, chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism<\/p> <p>The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which was introduced under the administration of former President Barack Obama, makes it a crime for someone to be injured or assaulted with a dangerous weapon due to their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected categories.<\/p> <p>The case of James Byrd Jr. dates back to 1998. Like Arbery, Byrd had been murdered by three white men.<\/p> <p>Byrd accepted a ride from Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer and John King, all of whom were white supremacists, in Jasper, Texas. Instead of taking Byrd home during the ride, they severely beat him and chained him by his ankles, dragging him with a pickup truck.<\/p> <p>After Byrd\u2019s lynching, Texas enacted its own hate crime law.<\/p> <p>Experts view the murder of Byrd and the enactment of the act as a pivotal moment in American history and also something that was long overdue.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cI think it is noteworthy under the Shepard Byrd act, which were two other cases that captured the soul of good America at a time when we are looking at increases of racial violence,\u201d Levin said.<\/p> <p>Arbery\u2019s family rejected a plea deal in the federal hate crime charges on Jan. 7, even after the men were convicted of murder in Glynn County.<\/p> <p>His mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the media that the three men need to stand trial again for their brutal actions.<\/p> <p>A Climate Of Hate<\/p> <p>Hate crimes against Black people jumped nearly 40% from 2019 to 2020. And 2020, the year Arbery was murdered, saw the most hate crimes in the country since 2001, according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.<\/p> <p>The year Arbery was killed, protests across the country followed the murder of George Floyd by a police officer as well as the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville.<\/p> <p>During this time, 61% of hate crimes showed people were targeted because of their race, ethnicity or ancestry, according to statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. White people comprised 55% of the perpetrators who committed hateful acts.<\/p> <p>From 2010 to 2019, hate crime numbers recorded by law enforcement increased by 10%. From 2015 to 2019, nearly half of hate crimes were motivated by anti-Black or anti-African American bias.<\/p> <p>The Department of Justice says Attorney General Merrick Garland has made confronting hate crimes a \u201ctop priority\u201d and said it is rooted in the department\u2019s \u201cfoundational history\u201d of combating racial violence and protecting civil rights, according to department spokesperson Areyele Bradford.<\/p> <p>\u201cHate crimes impact not only specifically targeted victims, but they also instill fear across communities at large \u2014 regardless of whether they gain broader attention nationally,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cConsequently, the prosecution of hate crimes vindicates the rights of not only specifically targeted victims, but of larger communities as well.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hate crime experts who have studied America\u2019s racist and alt-right-adjacent groups over decades believe the trial will be critical.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3GL25Y684591VS0PAXZQS2J3XX7XM8"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":681,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"1998.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jasper","region":"None","country":"Texas","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahmaud Arbery","victim_keywords":"murder, hate crime, Georgia, racism","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"George Floyd","victim_keywords":"killed by police, protests","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Breonna Taylor","victim_keywords":"killed by police, Louisville","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Byrd Jr","victim_keywords":"hate crime, racism, 1998, Texas, lynching, dragging death","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"1998.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jasper","region":"None","country":"Texas","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahmaud Arbery","victim_keywords":"murder, hate crime, Georgia, racism","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"George Floyd","victim_keywords":"killed by police, protests","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Breonna Taylor","victim_keywords":"killed by police, Louisville","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Byrd Jr","victim_keywords":"hate crime, racism, 1998, Texas, lynching, dragging death","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":903929722,"Input.title":"Trump boasts about killing Soleimani in Union address","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>US President Donald Trump boasted about the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani during his third State of Union address, as the embattled leader fights an impeachment hearing led by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.In a movement of fury, Pelosi tore up her copy of Trump's address, which came after the US president refused to shake her hand amid his upcoming acquittal on dealing with a foreign power.The US president delivered the address on the eve of his expected acquittal in the US senate, where he talked of the late American Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, who had been killed in Iraq on Easter Sunday in 2008.\"The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani,\" he told the hall, along with the sergeant's widow and child.<\/p> <p>Read More: 'Nobody resembles him but Assad': Syrians celebrate death of Soleimani<\/p> <p>\"[He] provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris' life.

A who person suffers greatly or dies for the nation or motherland rather than give up and the ones never accept slavery can die willingly for the motherland, that become Martyrs.<\/p> <p>Martyrs devote their everything for their nation, motherland and other beliefs. Similarly, in Balochistan there are have been lots of selfless sons and daughters, whom we regards as national martyrs, have sacrificed their precious lives for their motherland. The Baloch Martyrs Day is on 13 November 1839 \u2013 the day when British colonial forces attack Balochistan and the Baloch ruler of the time Mr Mehrab Khan chose martyrdom over surrender and slavery. It is day of great pride for Baloch nation as Mir Mehrab Khan and his comrades resisted against the British army and had fought bravely against them till the end of their lives, but they did not quite the battle or run away from the battlefield.<\/p> <p>He surely knew that it was not easy to defeat an army armed with sophisticated weapons and in large number and kept the culture of resistance alive and did not submit before the might of enemy forces. He greatly fought and embraced martyrdom on 13 November 1839.<\/p> <p>This was not the first and last Baloch resistance or foreign attack against Balochistan because after the British left their legacy of divide and rule or weaken and occupy remained intact. Pakistan and Iran begun their expansionism and evil designs against Baloch nation. Even though the British had divided Balochistan but before leaving the sub-continent, they recognised the independence of Eastern part of Balochistan (currently occupied by Pakistan).<\/p> <p>The freedom, however, was short-lived because the British brainchild Pakistan started its conspiracy and eventually occupied Balochistan in March 1948 after the Baloch nation overwhelmingly rejected to merge their country with Pakistan on the basis of religion. Hence, the Baloch war of liberation was once again intensified.<\/p> <p>Even today, the Baloch brave sons and daughters are sacrificing their lives for the freedom and a dignified future. The Pakistani and Iranian intelligence agencies and armies are committing war crimes in Balochistan by using excessive force and brutalities but the resolve and determination of brave Baloch fighters is unbreakable. Those of young men, women and children who have been martyred for Balochistan.<\/p> <p>Thousands of brightest and educated people in Balochistan including journalists, writers, teachers, leaders, students have been abducted and disappeared for years, tortured and killed in custody by Pakistani forces. An example is the case of Abdul Hameed Hayathan Baloch, a young journalist who was abducted from Gwadar on 25 October 2010 and on November 18 his body was found beside the river Sami in Turbat area of district Kech in Balochistan. The body of a student, Hamid Ismail was alongside Hayathan Baloch\u2019s found on Eid day and a massage found with the bodies that\u201d Eid present for Baloch people\u201d these were the words of Pakistani forces. This act of sheer savageness by Pakistani forces shows their hatred against Baloch nation and their frightfulness from the educated Baloch youth.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, on 26 April, a Baloch artist Minhaj Mukhtar was attacked by Pakistani forces fire and terrorised his family members including women and children. On June 1st Saba Dashtyari, a professor at the University of Balochistan and one of the greatest poets and writers was shot by unidentified gunmen in the provincial capital Quetta, in a public place. As like on 10 Feb 2011, Jamil Yaqub\u2019s body were bearing marks of torture was found on the outskirts of Turbat.<\/p> <p>Moreover, the Pakistani and Iranian state crimes have become so common in Balochistan that with the passage of time the number of Baloch martyrs continue to increase. Baloch women children, elderly and people from all spheres of life are being killed in Balochistan only for raise voice for the freedom of their motherland and being Baloch. The occupiers of Baloch nation on both sides of the artificial border are killing Baloch indiscriminately.<\/p> <p>Today, Balochistan feels proud to have brave sons and daughters who are willing to die for their for the freedom and dignity of their motherland. The culture of resistance ignited by Mir Mehrab Khan, Agha Abdul Karim and Babo Nourz Khan has been continued by thousands of other martyrs and will their legacy will continue till their mission of regaining Balochistan\u2019s independence is fulfilled.<\/p> <p>Every martyr deserves praising, A huge great salute to all those martyrs who have devoted their priceless lives\u2026.. a cruel rule before death.

He had already had ample time and opportunity to shut down the prison which operates with no international monitoring and entirely outside the realms of international and US laws.<\/p> <p>Obama is likely to be remembered for his words, not his actions. Not only did he fail to shut down the prison which was erected by his predecessor, George W. Bush, in 2002, but the Guantanamo industry also continued to thrive during his time in the White House. For example, in his speech, Obama made reference to the high cost of \"a hundred and fifty million dollars each year to imprison 166 people.\" According to the New Yorker in 2016, Guantanamo's budget had grown to \"$445 million\" while Obama was in office.<\/p> <p>READ: Barack Obama and the shattered hopes of a new Middle East<\/p> <p>Yet, as the budget grew by leaps and bounds, the number of Guantanamo prisoners dwindled. There are now just 40 prisoners in the massive edifice of metal, concrete and barbed wire built within a US naval base at the eastern tip of Cuba on land 'leased' by the US in 1903.<\/p> <p>It is easy to conclude that the US government keeps the prison open only to avoid international accountability and, arguably, to extract information by torture, an act that is inconsistent with American law. But this cannot be right. The wars against Afghanistan and Iraq were illegal under international law, but that didn't stop the US and its allies from savagely invading, humiliating and torturing entire populations with no regard whatsoever to legal or moral arguments.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Guantanamo is merely one of many American-run prisons and detention centres operating around the world according to the most ruthless tactics and no rule book. The tragedy of Abu Ghraib, a US military detention centre in Baghdad, only became famous when direct evidence of the degrading and incredibly violent conduct that was taking place within its walls was produced and publicised. Furthermore, many US officials and members of Congress at the time used the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2004 as an opportunity to whitewash and rebrand American crimes elsewhere and to present the misconduct within the prison as if it was an isolated incident involving \"a few bad apples\".<\/p> <p>This argument was made by George W Bush. It was more or less the same logic utilised by Obama when he championed the closure of Guantanamo. Indeed, both presidents insisted that neither Abu Ghraib nor Guantanamo should be made out to represent what America is really all about.<\/p> <p>\"Is this who we are?\" asked Obama passionately as he made the case for the closure of Guantanamo, speaking as if he was a human rights advocate rather than the Commander-in-Chief with the authority to shut down the entire facility immediately. The truth is that the Abu Ghraib tortures were not \"a few bad apples\" and Guantanamo is, indeed, a microcosm of exactly what the US is, or has become.<\/p> <p>From Bagram in Afghanistan, to Abu Ghraib in Iraq, to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, to the many \"floating prisons\" \u2014 news of which was leaked by US media in 2014 \u2014 the US government continues to make a mockery of international and humanitarian laws. Many American officials who genuinely advocate the closure of Guantanamo refuse to acknowledge that the prison is a symbol of their country's intransigence, and refuse to accept that, like any other country in the world, it is accountable to international law.<\/p> <p>This lack of accountability has exceeded the US government's insistence on \"acting alone\" and launching wars without international mandates. One US administration after another has also made it clear that, under no circumstances, would they allow American citizens accused of war crimes to be investigated, let alone stand trial, before the International Criminal Court (ICC). The message here is that even America's \"few bad apples\" can potentially walk free, regardless of the heinousness of their crimes.<\/p> <p>Just months after the Trump administration imposed punitive sanctions on ICC judges for having the audacity to look into possible investigations of US crimes in Afghanistan, it freed the convicted criminals who carried out horrific crimes in Iraq. On 22 December, Trump pardoned four American mercenaries from the private military company Blackwater. These convicted murderers were involved in the killing of 14 civilians, including two children, in Baghdad in 2007.<\/p> <p>READ: The protests may reveal America's social and political decay, but don't expect another revolution<\/p> <p>What became known as the \"Nisour Square massacre\" was another example of whitewashing, as government officials and mainstream media insisted that the massacre was an isolated episode, even while expressing outrage at the unlawful killing. The fact that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, mostly civilians, were killed as a result of the US invasion seems irrelevant in America's skewed logic as it pursues its never-ending \"war on terror\".<\/p> <p>Whether Biden fulfils his promise to shut down Guantanamo or not, little will change if the US remains committed in its contempt for international law and to its undeserved view of itself as a country that exists above the universal rights of everyone else.<\/p> <p>That said, Guantanamo on its own is a crime against humanity and there can never be any rational explanation or justification for holding hundreds of people indefinitely, without trial, without due process, without international observers and without ever seeing their families and loved ones. The explanation often offered by the pro-Guantanamo pundits is that the prison inmates are dangerous men. If that was indeed the case, why were these supposed criminals not allowed to have their day in court?<\/p> <p>According to a report by Amnesty International published in May last year, of the 779 men who were taken to the prison, \"only seven have been convicted\". Worse, five of them were convicted \"as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty, in return for the possibility of release from the base.\" According to the rights group, such a trial by military commission \"did not meet fair trial standards\".<\/p> <p>In other words, Guantanamo is \u2014 and has always been \u2014 a fraudulent operation with no real inclination to hold criminals and terrorists to account and prevent further crimes. Guantanamo is an industry, and a lucrative one. In many ways, it is similar to the American prison military complex, ironically dubbed the \"criminal justice system\". Referring to the unjust \"justice system\", Human Rights Watch derided the US for having \"the largest reported prison population in the world\".<\/p> <p>\"The (US) criminal justice system \u2014 from policing and prosecution, through to punishment \u2014 is plagued with injustices like racial disparities, excessively harsh sentencing and drug and immigration policies that improperly emphasise criminalisation,\" stated HRW on its website.<\/p> <p>The above can also be considered an answer to Obama's rhetorical question, \"Is this who we are?\" Yes sir, Mr President, this is precisely who you are.<\/p> <p>While offering the world's most miserable detention conditions to hundreds of potentially innocent men, Guantanamo also offers career opportunities, military perks and honours, and a seemingly endless budget for a small army to guard only a few shackled, gaunt-looking men in a foreign land.<\/p> <p>Even if Biden is able to overcome pressure from the military, the CIA and Congress and succeeds in shutting Guantanamo down, justice will still be absent, not only because of the numerous lives that are forever shattered, but also because America still refuses to learn from its mistakes. Guantanamo Bay Prison is indeed America's enduring shame.<\/p> <p>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3ZFRE2BDQBT1UZZ8PMPK04FCC1PZXR"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":308,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Nisour Square massacre, 2007, Iraq, Blackwater, children, civilians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Guantanamo Bay, prisoners, extrajudicial imprisonment, war on terror","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Nisour Square massacre, 2007, Iraq, Blackwater, children, civilians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Guantanamo Bay, prisoners, extrajudicial imprisonment, war on terror","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":957784769,"Input.title":"Worsening Abduction Crisis Rocks Haiti, Further Stalls Long Overdue Elections","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-03 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Many healthcare workers went on strike in Haiti this week to protest the government\u2019s inability to stop a plague of ransom abductions.

These restrictions, not based on an individualized assessment of security risk, robbed with rare exceptions the 2 million Palestinians living there of their right to freedom of movement, limited their access to electricity and water, and devastated the economy. Eighty percent of Gaza\u2019s residents depend on humanitarian aid.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities also facilitated the further transfer of Israeli citizens into settlements in the occupied West Bank, a war crime. The Israeli group Peace Now said that Israeli officials in 2020 advanced plans for more housing units in West Bank settlements, 12,159 as of October 15, more than in any other year since it began tracking these statistics in 2012.<\/p> <p>According to the UN Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of October 19, 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 568 Palestinian homes and other structures in the West Bank this year, including in East Jerusalem, displacing 759 people. Most buildings were demolished for lacking Israeli building permits, which are virtually impossible to obtain. As the Covid-19 pandemic spread between March and August, Israel averaged its highest home demolition rate in four years, OCHA found. On November 3, Israeli authorities razed the homes of most residents of the Palestinian community of Khirbet Humsah in the Jordan Valley for being in an area it designated as a \u201cfiring zone,\u201d displacing 73 people, 41 of them children.<\/p> <p>The coalition agreement between the Likud and Blue and White parties that led to the formation of an Israeli government in May, after three rounds of elections in the preceding year, established a process to bring annexation of additional parts of the West Bank for approval. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in August that Israel would delay the move following an agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, but that \u201cthere is no change to my plan to extend sovereignty\u201d over the West Bank.<\/p> <p>Both the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Hamas authorities in Gaza detained opponents and critics for their peaceful expression and tortured some in their custody. The Palestinian statutory watchdog, Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), received 269 complaints of arbitrary arrests, 147 against the PA and 122 by Hamas; 90 complaints of torture and ill-treatment, 40 against the PA and 50 against Hamas, and 62 complaints against the PA of detention without trial or charge pursuant to orders from a regional governor between January and September 2020. The number of complaints decreased compared to previous years, which the ICHR attributes primarily to the fewer prison visits it conducted amid the pandemic.<\/p> <p>Gaza Strip<\/p> <p>Although fighting between Israel and Palestinian armed groups decreased compared to previous years, Israeli authorities maintained their closure of Gaza, alongside restrictions Egypt maintains on its border. Palestinian armed groups, as of October 21, fired 187 unguided rockets or mortar shells towards Israeli population centers in 2020, according to the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, inherently indiscriminate attacks that amount to war crimes.<\/p> <p>Incendiary balloons launched into Israel by Palestinians in Gaza prompted Israeli authorities in August in retaliation to limit the entry into Gaza of goods, including food and medicine, to block access to Gaza\u2019s territorial waters for Palestinian fishermen and to slash fuel imports to Gaza\u2019s power plant, further reducing the already limited supply of electricity for almost three weeks. These measures, targeting Gaza\u2019s general civilian population, amount to unlawful collective punishment.<\/p> <p>In August, Gaza recorded its first cases of community transmission of coronavirus. Hamas authorities, which since March had required returning residents to spend 21 days in quarantine at centers they oversee, imposed a 14-day lockdown and other restrictive measures. As of October 19, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry had recorded 4,722 Covid-19 cases and 28 deaths, most of them since August.<\/p> <p>Israeli Closure<\/p> <p>Israel restricted the ability of most Gaza residents to travel through the Erez Crossing, the sole passenger crossing from Gaza into Israel through which Palestinians travel to the West Bank and abroad. A generalized travel ban applies to all Palestinians except those whom Israeli authorities deem as presenting \u201cexceptional humanitarian circumstances,\u201d mostly those needing vital medical treatment and their companions, as well as prominent business people.<\/p> <p>During January and February, an average of 778 Palestinians in Gaza exited via Erez each day, a fraction of the daily average of more than 24,000 before the beginning of the second Intifada in September 2000, according to the Israeli rights group, Gisha. After Israel tightened the closure amid the pandemic, that figure plummeted between April and September to about nine people per day.<\/p> <p>In May, the PA suspended security and administrative coordination with Israel, including the issuance of travel permits, in response to Israel\u2019s annexation plans. This move left Gaza residents with no clear way to apply for permits, since Israeli authorities do not have a formal physical presence inside Gaza and did not create alternative mechanisms to accept applications directly. Several organizations in June began applying on behalf of Palestinians with scheduled appointments for urgent medical care outside Gaza and the World Health Organization (WHO) took on the coordination role in September. According to data received by the WHO, Israel denied or failed to respond in a timely manner to 54 percent of such applications in June. In November, the PA said that it would resume security and administrative coordination with Israel.<\/p> <p>Gaza\u2019s exports between January and September, mostly destined for the West Bank and Israel, averaged 256 truckloads per month, compared to the monthly average of 1,064 truckloads prior to the June 2007 tightening of the closure, according to Gisha. Israel also sharply restricted and often prohibited the entry of what they deem \u201cdual-use\u201d materials, items that could be used for military purposes. The list included X-ray and communications equipment, construction materials, spare parts and batteries for assistive devices used by people with disabilities, and other vital civilian items.<\/p> <p>Families in Gaza on average received slightly more than 12 hours of electricity a day during the first nine months of 2020, according to OCHA. Chronic prolonged power outages encumber everyday life, in particular for people with disabilities who rely on light to communicate using sign language or equipment powered by electricity, such as elevators or electric wheelchairs, to move. More than 96 percent of groundwater in Gaza is \u201cunfit for human consumption,\u201d OCHA found. According to the WHO, 47 percent of what it deems to be \u201cessential\u201d medicines were at zero stock level (less than one month's supply) at Gaza\u2019s Central Drug Store at the end of September.<\/p> <p>Egypt also sharply restricted the movement of people and goods at its Rafah crossing with Gaza, including restricting entry to those who do not have a Palestinian ID because Israel did not include them in the population registry they control. In the first nine months of 2020, an average of 4,767 Palestinians crossed monthly in both directions, less than the monthly average of 12,172 in 2019 and over 40,000 before the 2013 military coup in Egypt, according to Gisha.<\/p> <p>Hamas and Palestinian Armed Groups in Gaza<\/p> <p>Hamas authorities provided no information about two Israeli civilians with psychosocial disabilities, Avera Mangistu and Hisham al-Sayed, whom they have apparently held in violation of international law for more than five years after they entered Gaza.<\/p> <p>In April, Hamas authorities detained seven activists for participating in a video chat where they answered questions from Israeli civilians about life in Gaza. Two were detained for more than six months and three were convicted under military law of \u201cweakening the revolutionary spirit.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hamas authorities carried out no executions in 2020; they had carried out 25, following trials marred with due process violations, since they took control in Gaza in June 2007. Courts in Gaza had, as of November 2, sentenced 145 people to death in that time, according to the Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights.<\/p> <p>A British Mandate-era law still in force in Gaza punishes \u201cunnatural intercourse\u201d of a sexual nature, understood to include same-sex relationships, with up to 10 years in prison, although Human Rights Watch has not documented detentions for same-sex conduct.<\/p> <p>West Bank<\/p> <p>Israeli Use of Force & Detentions<\/p> <p>In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Israeli security forces killed 20 Palestinians and wounded at least 2,001 as of October 5, according to OCHA, including those alleged to have attacked Israelis, but also those uninvolved in violence.<\/p> <p>On May 30, Israeli border police in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City fatally shot an unarmed 32-year-old Palestinian man with autism, Eyad al-Hallaq, after he reportedly fled when they asked him to stop. According to what an officer on the scene reportedly told Israeli investigators, police shot him in a \u201cclosed space\u201d where he did not \u201cendanger\u201d anyone. In October, authorities indicated that they will likely charge the officer who shot al-Hallaq with reckless homicide, pending a pretrial hearing.<\/p> <p>On June 23, border police shot and killed, apparently unlawfully, 26-year-old Ahmed Erekat after his car crashed into a checkpoint and he exited the vehicle in circumstances where he did not appear to pose an imminent threat to life. Authorities characterized the incident as a car-ramming attack; his family said it was an accident.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities have rarely held accountable security forces who used excessive force or settlers who attacked Palestinians.<\/p> <p>Settler violence against Palestinians during the first five months of 2020 remained at 2019 levels, a marked increase from prior years, OCHA found. Settlers killed one Palestinian civilian, wounded 103, and caused property damage in 136 incidents as of October 5, according to OCHA.<\/p> <p>Palestinian attackers killed one Israeli soldier and wounded at least 28 Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, as of September 22.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities in September said they would continue withholding the bodies of Palestinians killed in what they consider security incidents primarily as leverage to secure Hamas\u2019s release of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers presumed killed in 2014 hostilities. Israel held, as of September, the bodies of 67 Palestinians killed since 2015, according to the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center.<\/p> <p>In the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya, Israeli forces arrested 850 Palestinians between April 2019 and April 2020, according to the Israeli rights group, B\u2019Tselem, as part of an \u201congoing campaign of abuse\u201d against its residents.<\/p> <p>In April, Israeli police shut down a coronavirus testing center set up by residents in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan on the grounds that it operated with PA assistance.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities closely monitor online speech by Palestinians, in part relying on predictive algorithms to determine whom to target, and have detained Palestinians based on social media posts and other expressive activity.<\/p> <p>As of August 31, according to Israeli Prison Services figures, Israel held 4,207 Palestinians in custody for \u201csecurity\u201d offenses, including 153 children, many for throwing stones, and 355 in administrative detention without formal charges or trial and based on secret evidence.<\/p> <p>While applying Israeli civil law to settlers, Israeli authorities govern West Bank Palestinians, excluding Jerusalem residents, under harsh military law. In so doing, they deny them basic due process and try them in military courts with a near-100 percent conviction rate. Israel incarcerates many Palestinians from the OPT inside Israel, complicating family visits and violating international humanitarian law\u2019s prohibition against their transfer outside occupied territory.<\/p> <p>Settlements & Home Demolitions<\/p> <p>Israel allocated additional confiscated Palestinian land to unlawful settlements and provided security, infrastructure, and services for more than 647,000 settlers residing in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.<\/p> <p>In June, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court struck down a law allowing authorities to retroactively expropriate land on which settlements had been built but that Israel acknowledged to be privately owned by Palestinians. In its justification, however, the court cited \u201cless harmful tools\u201d that could have the same effect, including a military order that upholds land deals when authorities reasonably believed at the time of sale that the land was not privately owned, effectively approving the unlawful expropriations.<\/p> <p>Jerusalem courts in several cases ordered the eviction of Palestinian families from homes in which they had lived for decades in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan largely based on discriminatory laws that favor claims that the land belonged to Jewish owners before 1948 or that allow the state to take over land as \u201cabsentee property.\u201d<\/p> <p>The difficulty in obtaining Israeli building permits in East Jerusalem and the 60 percent of the West Bank under Israel\u2019s exclusive control (Area C) has driven Palestinians to construct housing, schools, and business structures that are at constant risk of demolition or confiscation for being unauthorized. OCHA considered, as of April 2020, 46 Palestinian West Bank communities to be at \u201chigh risk of forcible transfer\u201d due to coercive Israeli policies. International law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property unless \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for \u201cmilitary operations.\u201d<\/p> <p>Freedom of Movement for Palestinians<\/p> <p>Israel continued to enforce its permit regime requiring Palestinian ID holders with rare exceptions to apply for time-limited permits from the Israeli army to enter large parts of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. B\u2019Tselem describes this as \u201can arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bureaucratic system\u201d where \u201cmany applications are denied without explanation, with no real avenue for appeal.\u201d Israeli authorities, as of June, maintained nearly 600 checkpoints and other permanent obstacles within the West Bank, in addition to nearly 1,500 ad-hoc \u201cflying\u201d checkpoints erected between April 2019 and March 2020, according to OCHA. Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation.<\/p> <p>The separation barrier, which Israel said it built for security reasons but 85 percent of which falls within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line separating Israeli from Palestinian territory, cuts off thousands of Palestinians from their agricultural lands. It also isolates 11,000 Palestinians who live on the western side of the barrier but are not allowed to travel to Israel and whose ability to cross the barrier to access their property and basic services is highly restricted.<\/p> <p>The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank<\/p> <p>As of October 21, the PA reported 43,308 Covid-19 cases and 399 deaths since the outbreak began in the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem. While at times imposing restrictions across the parts of the West Bank where it manages affairs, it has largely relied on localized lockdowns of areas that experience a surge in cases.<\/p> <p>Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh pledged in July 2019 to end arbitrary arrests. In June, PA forces detained journalist Sami al-Sai for three weeks over suspicions that he administered a Facebook page that had posted information about PA corruption. PA forces in July arrested about 20 activists in Ramallah heading to a protest about PA corruption, detaining them for more than a week, and prosecuting them on charges of gathering illegally and violating restrictive Covid-19 measures.<\/p> <p>PA personal status laws discriminated against women, including in relation to marriage, divorce, and decisions relating to custody of children and inheritance. Women\u2019s rights groups documented an increase in reports of domestic violence during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. However, Palestine has no comprehensive domestic violence law. The PA is considering a draft family protection law, but women\u2019s rights groups have raised concern that it does not go far enough to prevent abuse and protect survivors.<\/p> <p>Israel<\/p> <p>Israel had registered 306,649 Covid-19 cases and 2,278 deaths, including in East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements, as of October 21. Israel instituted lockdowns between late March and early May, and again between late September and mid-October. To track Covid-19, Israeli authorities authorized Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security service, to collect from telecommunications providers, beginning in March, vast amounts of location-tracking data from the cellphones of ordinary Israelis without their consent. The Knesset in July authorized the surveillance for six months, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in April that the government must bring the program under legislation.<\/p> <p>In June, the Knesset renewed a temporary order in place since 2003 that bars, with few exceptions, granting long-term legal status or residency inside Israel to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents, in many cases forcing the separation of families.<\/p> <p>Thousands of Israelis participated in weekly demonstrations beginning in June, primarily against the government\u2019s handling of Covid-19 and corruption charges against Prime Minister Netanyahu. Israeli police forcibly dispersed several demonstrations and beat and arrested scores of protesters. The Israeli group Human Rights Defenders Fund said that between July 14 and 26 in Jerusalem alone it provided legal counsel to more than 150 demonstrators who had been detained.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities continued to systematically deny asylum claims of the roughly 32,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers in the country.

But the Trump administration is seeking to extradite Assange to the United States to stand trial for charges under the Espionage Act that could cause him to spend 175 years in prison.<\/p> <p>Assange founded WikiLeaks during the Bush administration\u2019s \u201cwar on terror,\u201d which was used as a pretext to start two illegal wars and carry out a widespread program of torture and abuse of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo and the CIA black sites. On October 8, 2011, Assange told a Stop the War Coalition rally in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square, \u201cIf wars can be started by lies, peace can be started by truth.\u201d<\/p> <p>In 2010 and 2011, WikiLeaks published classified material that Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning had provided to the organization. Manning was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking the documents. As he left office, Barack Obama commuted her sentence to the seven years she had already served. That commutation provoked \u201ctremendous anger\u201d in the Trump administration and drew Trump\u2019s attention to Assange, Eric Lewis testified. Lewis, chairman of the board of Reprieve U.S. and lawyer for Guant\u00e1namo and Afghan detainees, called this \u201ca politically motivated prosecution.\u201d<\/p> <p>The files that WikiLeaks published contained 90,000 reports about the war in Afghanistan, including the Afghan War Logs, which documented a greater number of civilian casualties by coalition forces than the U.S. military had reported.<\/p> <p>In addition, WikiLeaks published nearly 400,000 field reports about the Iraq War, more than 15,000 unreported deaths of Iraqi civilians, and the systematic murder, torture and rape by the Iraqi army and authorities that were ignored by U.S. forces.<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks also published the Guant\u00e1namo Files, 779 secret reports constituting evidence of the U.S. government\u2019s abuse of approximately 800 men and boys, ages 14 to 89. That abuse violated the Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the most notorious release by WikiLeaks was the 2007 \u201cCollateral Murder\u201d video, which depicts a U.S. Army Apache helicopter target and fire on unarmed civilians in Baghdad. At least 18 civilians were killed, including two Reuters reporters and a man who came to rescue the wounded. Two children were injured. A U.S. Army tank drove over one of the bodies, cutting it in half. The video contained evidence of three separate war crimes prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and the U.S. Army Field Manual.<\/p> <p>As they are firing on the civilians, U.S. gunmen can be heard saying, \u201cLook at those dead bastards.\u201d In his written testimony, investigative journalist Nicky Hager drew a parallel between the Collateral Murder video and the television image of George Floyd screaming \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d<\/p> <p>Assange Cannot Be Extradited for a Political Offense<\/p> <p>The 2003 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty forbids extradition for a political offense. Although the treaty doesn\u2019t define \u201cpolitical offense,\u201d it generally includes espionage, treason, sedition and crimes against state power. Trump is asking the U.K. to extradite Assange for exposing war crimes. This is a classic political offense. Assange is charged under the Espionage Act and espionage constitutes a political offense as well\u2026\u2026\u2026..<\/p> <p>Assange\u2019s Prosecution Violates Freedom of Press<\/p> <p>While the Obama administration declined to file criminal charges against Assange for fear of setting a dangerous precedent, Team Trump demonstrated no such forbearance. By charging Assange under the Espionage Act, Trump is making him a poster boy for its full court press against the media, which he calls \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d Assange\u2019s prosecution would send an ominous message to all journalists: report the unvarnished truth at your peril.<\/p> <p>No media outlet or journalist has ever been prosecuted under the Espionage Act for publishing truthful information, which is protected First Amendment activity. Journalists are permitted to publish material that was illegally obtained by a third person and is a matter of public concern. The U.S. government has never prosecuted a journalist or newspaper for publishing classified information, an essential tool of journalism.<\/p> <p>Information-gathering, reporting and disclosure fit the classic definition of activity protected by the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of the press. There is no distinction between what WikiLeaks did and what The New York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and The Guardian did as well. They all published articles based on documents WikiLeaks released. This is the reason Obama administration \u2014 which prosecuted an enormous number of whistleblowers \u2014 considered, but refrained from, indicting Assange. \u2026\u2026\u2026<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks Didn\u2019t Endanger Informants and Saved Lives<\/p> <p>Although the U.S. government claims that Assange endangered informants named in the published documents, John Goetz, an investigative reporter who worked for Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel, testified that Assange took pains to ensure that the names of U.S. informants in Iraq and Afghanistan were redacted to protect their identities. \u2026\u2026..<\/p> <p>Moreover, WikiLeaks\u2019s revelations actually saved lives. After WikiLeaks published evidence of Iraqi torture centers the U.S. had established, the Iraqi government refused Obama\u2019s request to extend immunity to U.S. soldiers who commit criminal and civil offenses there. As a result, Obama had to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq.<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks also revealed evidence of wrongdoing by other countries besides the United States. The organization uncovered Russian surveillance, published expos\u00e9s of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and some say WikiLeaks\u2019s exposure of corruption in Tunisia and torture in Egypt helped catalyze the Arab Spring\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026<\/p> <p>Assange\u2019s Prosecution Will Chill Journalism<\/p> <p>Ostensibly to get around allegations that it is prosecuting Assange for conducting journalism, the Trump administration is trying to paint him as a hacker by accusing him of conspiring with Manning to break into a government computer to steal government documents, in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. But, as Patrick Eller, a digital forensic expert, testified, the attempted cracking of the password hash was not technologically possible in 2010, when the conversation between Assange and Manning occurred. Even if it were feasible, the purpose would not have been to conceal Manning\u2019s identity and it would not have given Manning any increased access to government databases.<\/p> <p>The prosecution of Assange would set a disturbing example for journalists and media outlets that publish information critical of the government. Team Trump singled out Assange to deter journalists from publishing material that criticizes U.S. policy. If Assange is extradited to the United States and convicted of the charges against him, it would chill journalists from reporting the facts for fear they could be indicted under the Espionage Act\u2026\u2026\u2026.<\/p> <p>When she set the November 16 date for the defense to submit closing arguments, Judge Vanessa Baraitser asked the defense how the U.S. presidential election would affect its case and declared that her decision on extradition would come after that election, stating, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the factors going into my decision.\u201d Kristinn Hrafnsson, editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said that the judge \u201cacknowledged what has been clear since even before the first indictment against Julian Assange was unsealed \u2014 that this is a politically motivated prosecution.\u201d<\/p> <p>Baraitser, who has granted extradition in 96 percent of the cases that have come before her, plans to issue her ruling on January 4. If she grants extradition, there will be several levels of appeals, including to the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p> <p>The stakes could not be higher. https:\/\/truthout.org\/articles\/assange-faces-extradition-for-exposing-us-war-crimes\/?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=614ce999-9844-4d61-a600-169db0c99052<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"33IXYHIZB7X2IO5F5AQEP4KYBMG2EE"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":266,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Baghdad","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Collateral Murder, civilians, Reuters reporters, killed, helicopter attack, war crimes","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Baghdad","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Collateral Murder, civilians, Reuters reporters, killed, helicopter attack, war crimes","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1008211644,"Input.title":"Chiwetalu Agu Arrested for Inciting Public, Support for IPOB, Says Nigerian Army","Input.publish_date":"2021-10-08 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Nigerian army yesterday confirmed the arrest of veteran Nigerian actor, Chiwetala Agu for allegedly inciting the public and soliciting support for the indigenous peoples of Biafra, IPOB, in Onitsha, Anambra state.<\/p> <p>The Troops of the Nigerian Army arrested the veteran actor who was dressed in the Biafran flag at Upper Iweka Road, Onitsha, in Anambra state earlier.<\/p> <p>In a statement signed by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, the Nigerian army explained that Agu\u2019s actions negate the peace efforts in the region given the security situation in the state that has degenerated in the past few months leading to wanton killings and kidnappings<\/p> <p>According to the statement, contrary to reports of brutalisation, the veteran actor was merely taken into custody for further investigation.<\/p> <p>He said: \u201cTroops of the Nigerian Army (NA) have arrested one Chiwetalu Agu while inciting members of the public and soliciting for support for the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).<\/p> <p>\u201cDressed in a very well-known attire of the proscribed group, Chiwetalu Agu was picked up for questioning while inciting members of the public to join the proscribed group.

Aggett did not commit suicide, there was foul play and his death by hanging in the John Vorster Square police cells came about as a result of the \u201cdirect acts\u201d of Security Branch officers, Varney said.<\/p> <p>He added that should the court find that Aggett died by suicide, it had to be induced suicide arising from Aggett\u2019s prolonged detention of 70 days and sustained assault, torture and trauma inflicted on him in during the weeks, days and hours leading up to his death on 5 February 1982.<\/p> <p>Both Varney and the National Prosecuting Authority\u2019s (NPA\u2019s) Advocate Jabulani Mlotshwa argued that the forensic testimony presented in the reopened inquest pointed to a conclusion that Aggett could not have climbed his cell bars in the second floor of the John Vorster Square police station to hang himself. More likely, they maintained, is that evidence presented suggested that Aggett\u2019s hanging was staged after he was rendered into a state of unconsciousness or low consciousness.<\/p> <p>Along with this forensic testimony, Mlotshwa argued that had Aggett committed suicide, his chief interrogator, Lieutenant Steven Whitehead, and Sergeant Paul Erasmus (who testified in 2020) would not have gone to the extraordinary lengths they did \u2013 including at one point gaining illegal entry into Aggett\u2019s parents\u2019 home \u2013 to try to find \u201cevidence\u201d that Aggett had suicidal tendencies.<\/p> <p>Whitehead died in April 2019, just days before the NPA announced the inquest would be reopened. This followed years of inaction from the NPA around reopening the inquest into Aggett\u2019s death, which was among about 300 cases involving deaths and disappearances of anti-apartheid activists that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission had recommend for further investigation in 2003.<\/p> <p>Whitehead, dead at 62, reportedly from cancer, went to his grave without having to answer in a courtroom. Over the past 18 months though, he has been cast by his former colleagues as an upstart, willing to bend the rules to climb the ranks and to prove himself in the Security Branch. He was described as a party animal, a boozer and a daddy\u2019s boy and was regarded as untouchable, being on the receiving end of privilege and protection through nepotism.<\/p> <p>Mlotshwa also said Whitehead had a fixation with Aggett, a blinding obsession almost, that made his cruelty towards the young doctor explicit, although evidence presented to the court showed that Aggett was not involved with a banned organisation or any underground organisation \u2013 he was interested in fighting for workers\u2019 rights, which wasn\u2019t an illegal activity.<\/p> <p>But Whitehead and others ensured his torture in detention included electric shocks, beatings, sleep deprivation and physical and verbal abuse over an extended period \u2013 hallmarks of his interrogation and efforts to extract a confession from Aggett.<\/p> <p>The court also heard that Whitehead and the head of the Security Branch at the time, Major Arthur Conwright, were likely out to prove that they were close to piecing together a case that would be as explosive as \u201cthe next Treason Trial\u201d. It would be a significant breakthrough to quash an uprising against the National Party regime.<\/p> <p>Whitehead and Conwright, both now dead, left it to their colleagues that could be tracked down over the past few years to take the stand in the reopened inquest.<\/p> <p>Testimony these former cops gave over the past 18 months was almost uniformly marked by a refusal to divulge specifics, a defence of foggy memories lost to the passing decades, or a portrayal of close and cosy relationships with detainees who were well cared for. They said if torture or abuse had occurred they never heard or saw it happen and they never took part in any acts of torture or violence themselves.<\/p> <p>They also gave testimony of oaths of silence among the Security Branch members and acknowledged that members were an inner sanctum within the police and operated with their own codes and culture. Testimony was given that this routinely included the likes of cover-ups, falsifying registers and documentation, rigging identity parades and \u201cnot splitting on each other\u201d.<\/p> <p>Mlotshwa and Varney, in their separate closing statements, called these witnesses \u201cunreliable\u201d, \u201cbrazen liars\u201d and \u201cconspirators in cover-ups and suppression\u201d.<\/p> <p>Varney\u2019s recommendation to the court was that the findings in the original inquest, that Aggett died by suicide and that no one could be held responsible for his death, be overturned.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is a ruling that is deeply hurtful and an affront to Neil Aggett\u2019s family and friends. It remains a stain on history and the Security Branch officers must be held to account,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Varney asked the court to recommend that in addition to a charge of perjury that Nicolaas Deetlefs also be charged for Aggett\u2019s murder. This Varney said is based on Deetlefs\u2019s evidence that he considered Aggett a suicide risk but even so failed to notify the officer in charge of detainees or to report his concerns about Aggett\u2019s wellbeing to anyone who could have put in safeguards to protect him from self-harm.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe was acutely aware of what Conwright and Whitehead were doing and had a heightened legal duty to act, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d Varney said.<\/p> <p>Varney also called for the courts to ensure that Security Branch officers Joseph Petrus Woensdregt, Daniel Elhardhus Swanepoel, Roelof Venter and Eddie Chauke be made to \u201cface consequences for their brazen lies\u201d to the court.<\/p> <p>In his closing arguments, Advocate Stephanus Coetzee, acting for Martin Naude, Venter and Deetlefs, centred on Whitehead as \u201cthe main person\u201d involved with Aggett\u2019s interrogations, not his clients. He said officers like Naude and Deetlefs were only pulled into Aggett\u2019s interrogation as stand-ins and for short periods. Deetlefs, he said, spent just nine hours with Aggett and Venter had no direct interaction with the activist.<\/p> <p>Coetzee and Advocate Ashika Ramlaal, acting on behalf of Woensdregt, Johannes Visser and Swanepoel, maintained that the clue to knowing what led to Aggett\u2019s death comes down to the 15 hours before it occurred. It was at this time that Aggett made a complaint about a particularly severe interrogation he had suffered on 4 January 1982. He named Whitehead as well as a Sergeant James van Schalkwyk as the men who tortured him, as Chauke watched.<\/p> <p>Coetzee said Aggett was at the point of filing the complaint \u201cnot under duress\u201d and had \u201cregained enough self-confidence to confront his abusers\u201d. It demonstrated, Coetzee argued, that what came before the filing of the complaint could have no bearing on what caused Aggett\u2019s death 15 hours later. Ramlaal also made this submission.<\/p> <p>Coetzee also said Deetlefs would not have been able to report Aggett as a suicide risk because of \u201chierarchies of power and line functions\u201d in police reporting protocol. He also argued that Deetlefs had not misled the court even when he repeatedly said he couldn\u2019t remember specifics. Coetzee said it would have been more suspicious had Deetlefs remembered every detail after nearly 40 years.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt best the court can come to a probable finding but there is no evidence of direct murder,\u201d Coetzee said.<\/p> <p>Judgment is reserved.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3FJ2RVH251LLNSEYXZASXQJNKP0294"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":361,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"1982.0","month":"February","date":"5.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Neil Aggett","victim_keywords":"doctor, trade union organiser, murder, staged suicide, John Vorster Square","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"1982.0","month":"February","date":"5.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Neil Aggett","victim_keywords":"doctor, trade union organiser, murder, staged suicide, John Vorster Square","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1029001992,"Input.title":"Cops arrest doctor who helped Lumad of Mindanao","Input.publish_date":"2022-02-18 07:32:21","Input.article_interface":"<p>ARRESTED.

The warrant for the non-bailable cases was issued as early as January 2020.<\/p> <p>In a statement on Saturday, February 19, the PNP said that Castro was brought to and detained in Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur, where the court that issued the arrest warrant is located.<\/p> <p>The PNP said that her alleged \u201cmembership\u201d in the local communist movement is not the basis of the arrest \u201cbut her alleged criminal actions that constitute participation in a case of kidnapping with serious illegal detention.\u201d<\/p> <p>The police said that the CHR has already been informed about Castro\u2019s status, but the statement was silent on her right to counsel and if due process was violated. Castro\u2019s lawyers earlier said they were denied information and documents related to her case.<\/p> <p>Prior to her arrest, Castro had been red-tagged for her human rights advocacy, according to her brother. She served as secretary general of rights group Karapatan in Caraga region.<\/p> <p>Before the pandemic hit the country in 2020, Castro started several health programs in Mindanao. She also brought a member of the Lumad community to the United Nations in Geneva to seek help against harassment in Lumad areas.<\/p> <p>Play Video<\/p> <p>Castro was the high school valedictorian of St. Scholastica\u2019s Manila batch 1986 and was among the 100 most outstanding students of the educational institution in the last century.

They received phone calls from people in Chicago and Minneapolis informing them the FBI was raiding their homes. Burke thought the FBI might raid his house. He decided his daughter needed to get to kindergarten before the FBI entered his home. He left with his daughter.<\/p> <p>The next thing Burke did was write a press release. He took his computer, got in his car to go find a \u201cweb cafe.\u201d New to Grand Rapids, Michigan, he had little idea where to drive. He took two left turns and noticed a car behind him took two left turns too. It didn\u2019t seem right to Burke. He took another left turn, and the car behind him also took a left turn too.<\/p> <p>Burke decided the FBI was following them. He called his wife, and they agreed he should drive to the parking garage at her work. As Burke reached the parking garage, the car that had followed him sped off. An SUV sped into the road right behind him and followed him into the garage. Burke was served with a subpoena to appear before a grand jury. His wife was later served with a subpoena too.<\/p> <p>\u201cAn agent said you\u2019re being investigated for \u2018material support to a terrorist organization\u2019 and specifically it said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),\u201d recalled Burke. \u201cMyself, I\u2019ve been the spokesman for the National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, where we protested outside the trial in Washington, D.C., of a Colombian revolutionary and one of dozens of FARC leaders who was put on trial. We don\u2019t think he should have been put on trial in this country at all. We think they are angry at us for doing political organizing and exercising our right to free speech.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burke told the story of Ricardo Palmera saying he was a professor born into a wealthy family in Colombia. He attended the naval academy. In the 1960s, just before graduation, he decided to become a professor. Palmera chose to become a social activist and work to change Colombia so peasants in his country would no longer be violently exploited and oppressed. Soon friends were being tortured.<\/p> <p>The following decade Palmera \u201cfound that almost all his friends except for one of the founders of a group called Citizen Action, [a woman], were dead.\u201d Military and death squads killed them in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Palmera thought he had a choice between becoming a refugee and joining the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia. He fought as a member of the Patriotic Union.<\/p> <p>Palmera was captured by the Colombian government, seized in Ecuadorm and extradited to the U.S. in 2004. The U.S. government put him on trial. The first trial, according to Burke, was a \u201cterrorist trial that led to a hung jury.\u201d During the second one, \u201cFederal Judge Hogan was found cheating with a U.S. prosecutor and had to step down.\u201d<\/p> <p>The jury could not find Palmera guilty of \u201cterrorism,\u201d but they did find him guilty of \u201cbelonging to the FARC\u201d and so he was charged, mostly because he was found to have been involved in the kidnapping of three U.S. military contractors.<\/p> <p>\u201cThat charge should have carried only a 7-year maximum sentence, but the judge gave him sixty years,\u201d explained Burke. He is now in solitary confinement in a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, \u201cbeing held as a political prisoner.\u201d<\/p> <p>The FARC are, according to the National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, an \u201cindependent peasants\u2019 movement.\u201d A description of the FARC on the Committee\u2019s website claims \u201cone third\u201d of FARC fighters are women.<\/p> <p>But the U.S., which has forces intervening in the conflict in Colombia, considers the FARC to be terrorists, not a recognized military force at war with the military force backed by the Colombian government. This means the capturing of U.S. contractors, while FARC argues this was simply an act of taking prisoners of war, was regarded as something \u201cagainst the law of all civilized nations.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to his profile on the Committee to Stop FBI Repression\u2019s website, Burke has most recently been \u201ca stay home dad of a five-year old daughter. Tom grew up in the blue-collar suburbs of Chicago and received degrees from both the University of Illinois-Champaign-Urbana and the University of Illinois-Chicago. He then worked as a school custodian and building engineer in the Oak Park schools for 14 years, where he won an Illinois State award for service. Tom Burke was a union steward, union organizer, and elected to the Executive Board of Local 73, Service Employees International Union with 23,000 members.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burke shared how he and his wife have been active since the days when college students protested apartheid. He notes President Obama was part of that movement and supported Nelson Mandela, \u201cwho until three years ago was still on the U.S. terrorist list.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re proud that we were part of that successful movement to end apartheid. And we continue to be active around international solidarity. And so when were subpoenaed, we were shocked,\u201d said Burke. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the U.S. should have political police with the FBI, who are serving an agenda of building a U.S. empire. Activists like ourselves have a right to organize, a right to free speech, to speak out, to not have our houses searched, to not have our government demand our computers, our cell phones. We also think we have a right to not speak at a secret trial.\u201d<\/p> <p>A grand jury is not like trials most Americans have seen play out. Burke addressed how a grand jury works.<\/p> <p>\u201cAs an activist or any citizen, your called to face a grand jury where there\u2019s no judge in the proceedings. There\u2019s only the U.S. prosecutor. It\u2019s like a preemptive trial. So, the US prosecutor gets to pick the twenty-three jurors. There\u2019s no one from your side in the room.\u201d [For more info, read this post put together by a blogger at Firedoglake.]<\/p> <p>The U.S. prosecutor guides the twenty-three through the process. Those jurors tend to want to help and identify with the prosecutor. When you enter the room, your lawyer is not allowed to be with you. You have to excuse yourself and go to the hallway to talk to your lawyer. The media is not allowed to watch it and you can\u2019t have your family or friends in the room to support you either. All of that, and more, is why Burke and his wife decided to never cooperate with the grand jury.<\/p> <p>Finally, Burke emphasized, \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing solidarity work with people in other countries who get killed for doing what they do. When I went to Colombia in 2003, a labor union delegation my union local SEIU, at that time three Colombian trade unionists were being killed every single week. And that was the scariest week of my life.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burke was with the human rights director of the oil workers union, and all week he had to have armed security and know who was with the group and whether they were in a safe place.<\/p> <p>\u201cEvery week, a Colombian trade unionist gets killed,\u201d Burke declared.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3H6W48L9F64SRVSCS8VW7NZRT0CPW3"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":502,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2004.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Ecuador","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tom Burke","victim_keywords":"FARC, PFLP, advocate, National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, FBI, 2010","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ricardo Palmera","victim_keywords":"Columbia, social activist, FARC, Ecuador, extradition, 2004","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Columbia, trade union, workers, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2004.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Ecuador","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tom Burke","victim_keywords":"FARC, PFLP, advocate, National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, FBI, 2010","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ricardo Palmera","victim_keywords":"Columbia, social activist, FARC, Ecuador, extradition, 2004","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Columbia, trade union, workers, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1002703867,"Input.title":"Why Celebrate Labor Day","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>There is much confusion over why the United States of America and Canada commemorate Labor Day on the first Monday in September and not as many other nations do, on the first of May.<\/p> <p>For some workers unaware of the history, Labor Day is perceived as a tactic to counteract the militant international working-class spirit of May Day and becoming a symbol of workers\u2019 docility, of collaboration with the bosses, of everything that weakens. It is a day associated with BBQs, picnics and shopping at the mall. However, Labor Day is a celebration of America\u2019s and Canada\u2019s labor movement. That\u2019s easy to forget these days.<\/p> <p>Labor Day took its inspiration from a strike for the 8 hour day held in Toronto in the 1870s and was adopted by American workers, four years before the momentous events of 1886 that initiated May Day. So both Labor Day and May Day share common origins in the campaign for \u201c8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest and 8 hours for what we will\u201d as the song went.<\/p> <p>So both Mayday and Labor Day should be reminders of the need for working people to try and capture the good things in life and advance working peoples\u2019 well-being. Labor Day also came about because workers felt they were spending too many hours and days on the job. In the 1830s, manufacturing workers were putting in 70-hour weeks on average. Sixty years later, in 1890, hours of work had dropped, although the average manufacturing worker still toiled in a factory 60 hours a week. These long working hours caused many union organizers to focus on winning a shorter eight-hour workday. They also focused on getting workers more days off, such as the Labor Day holiday, and reducing the working week to just six days. Labor unions are still finding ways to wield their organizing influence and help fellow workers.<\/p> <p>The World Socialist Movement tries to explain the lessons of the first Mayday and Labor Day is that the capitalists need us, we do not need them. \u201cLabor creates all wealth, All wealth belongs to labor\u201d. Our fellow workers need to learn and understand the truth of that statement.<\/p> <p>In capitalism, the rich always grow richer and all workers can do within capitalism is slow that process down. What is needed is the entire edifice, the whole system \u2013 wages, profits, markets requires abolishing and only then can we make decisions to free ourselves and the world.<\/p> <p>Canadians will, of course, be fully aware that their Labor Day origins can be traced back to an 1872 printers strike in Toronto when a parade was staged in support of the Toronto Typographical Union\u2019s strike for a 58-hour work-week. Police arrested 24 leaders of the Typographical Union. Labour leaders decided to call for a demonstration on September 3 to protest the arrests. The Toronto Trades and Labour Council began to hold similar celebrations every spring. American Peter J. McGuire, the co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, was asked to speak at a labour festival in Toronto, Canada on July 22, 1882. Returning to the United States, McGuire and the Knights of Labor organised a similar parade based on the Canadian event on September 5, 1882.<\/p> <p>In the 1800s, unions covered only a small fraction of workers and were relatively weak. The goal of organizations like the Central Labor Union and more modern-day counterparts was to bring many small unions together to become more powerful. The organizers of the first Labor Day were interested in creating an event that brought different types of workers together to meet each other and recognize their common interests. Unions increase the bargaining power of workers, which translates into higher earnings and a stronger voice for employees.<\/p> <p>But like so many workers\u2019 initiatives, Labor Day was co-opted by the government and by the employers. It became a federal holiday in 1894, when, following the murder of workers during the Pullman Strike, in an attempt to appease the nation\u2019s workers, President Grover Cleveland fearing further conflict, rushed legislation through Congress to designate the first Monday in September Labor Day. The Cleveland Administration believed it would act as a counterweight to May Day, the international day of labor solidarity adopted by the First Congress of the Second Socialist International in 1889 to commemorate the Haymarket Massacre in Chicago in 1886 so from its outset Labor Day symbolized the official American labor movement\u2019s commitment to a more moderate form of politics! May Day emphasized the fact that the working class had to fight for its right to organize and for all the gains it had won in wages, hours and conditions of work. It was to counteract the militant working-class spirit of its marching legions on May Day that the government set aside the first Monday in September as a labor holiday. The American Labor Day holiday came as a \u201cgift\u201d that the workers received from their masters, through their servile politicians.<\/p> <p>Labor Day must not become a symbol of workers\u2019 docility, of collaboration with the bosses, of everything that weakens and hurts the working class. It cannot be a day when politicians and employers advertise and promote themselves. Every shrewd politician will pose as a \u201cfriend of labor\u201d, shaking hands and jovially slapping the labor union leaders on the back (later to stab them in the back), seeking to secure their endorsement and election donations with a lot of empty promises and false hopes before setting off the legislatures on the labor vote, promptly forgetting the pledges until next election rolls around.<\/p> <p>The reformists have kept socialist politics out of the trade union movement, while capitalist politics have run amok undoing the strength of the unions.<\/p> <p>Many working people now vote against their economic interests. Unions have donated more than millions to pro-business politicians.<\/p> <p>\u201cUnions fail partly from the injudicious use of their powers,\u201d wrote Marx. The World Socialist Movement does not shy away from warning our fellow workers what pitfalls are in store for them if they persist in giving their time, money and votes to parties that can only work in the interests of their masters. It is time that cash was directed at more worthwhile causes such as organizing the non-unionized.<\/p> <p>On Labor Day we must expose that great falsehood the slogan of \u201ca fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work.\u201d Since wages imply exploitation and represent but a minor fraction of the total product of labor, it is self-evident that wages can never be fair. Wages grow out of a system of unfairness, of robbery. Accordingly, for labor to acknowledge that there is such a thing as a \u201cfair wage\u201d is to kowtow to the principle of exploitation, to kiss the hand that robs it and impresses on the mind of labor the \u201cduty\u201d to deliver its goods\u2014its ability to produce\u2014to the master joyfully and to the fullest capacity. It puts on the worker, by his own consent, the brand of the slave.<\/p> <p>The history of the North American movement is rich in the tradition of the importance of unions to workers. The struggles waged and the gains won by workers demonstrate what can be achieved through organizing on the economic field. We have the unions to thank for a lot of things we take for granted: the eight-hour workday, child labor laws, health and safety standards and the weekend. And studies show that a large union presence in an industry or region can raise wages even for non-union workers. But as weak and ineffectual as the labor movement is today, it is still a potential threat.<\/p> <p>The history of the labor movement proves the Marxian contention that wages are not regulated by any \u201ciron law\u201d but can be modified by organized militant action on the part of the workers. The necessity of native-born and foreign workers; black, hispanic and white, to march together on picket lines, to work together in strike committees and hold out together until their demands are won \u2013 all this constitutes an object lesson in class solidarity that American and Canadian workers must learn and practice.<\/p> <p>It is time that Labor Day 2021 brings home the point: There is a need for a change in our society. Socialism is a necessity. It would destroy the capitalist system wherein one class is enriched by exploiting the majority. We need socialism because the means of life, the factories, mines, transport, communications and land should belong to the people! We need socialism because the production of the necessities of life would be for the use of the people instead of the profit of a few. The capitalist world heaps misery upon misery upon the backs of the toilers. Capitalism remains what it has been from birth: a system of exploitation of the many for the enrichment of the few. Labor Day should remind us of the urgency to move towards socialism. The capitalist world heaps misery upon misery upon the backs of the toilers. Capitalism remains what it has been from birth: a system of exploitation of the many for the enrichment of the few. Labor Day should remind us of the urgency to move towards socialism.<\/p> <p>We are all one\u2014all workers of all lands and climes. We know not color, nor creed, nor gender in the workers\u2019 movement. We know only that that with the solidarity of labor, we will vanquish wage-slavery and humanize the World. But when all is said and done, the workers won\u2019t get much from this annual love-fest of Labor Day messages and speeches.

Those named in the FIR were members of the Kabir Kala Manch \u2013 a radical Dalit cultural troupe.<\/p> <p>The complainant had accused the KKM activists of making a number of \u201cinflammatory\u201d speeches and delivering \u201csocially divisive\u201d presentations during the course of the troupe\u2019s performance and recitals at the \u2018Elgaar Parishad\u2019, which lasted nearly eight hours and witnessed the participation of thousands of persons from more than 250 progressive social outfits including several left-leaning and Ambedkarite groups across Maharashtra.<\/p> <p>The raids and subsequent arrests of the prominent activists and academics were based on this FIR, with the Pune police claiming to have extended the scope of their investigations to unearth alleged \u2018Maoist links\u2019 held by these intellectuals.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3DQYSJDTYNQ3J48CTZB7FUEUOVGXEJ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ac287307-81d2-4211-a19d-c6a1c38a754a","work_time_in_seconds":2112,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":"10","date":null,"city":"City","region":"Maharashtra","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Gautam Navlakha","victim_keywords":"human rights activist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"P.Varavara Rao","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ujjwala Pawar","victim_keywords":"lawyer","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Arun Ferreira","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vernon Gonsalves","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sudha Bharadwaj","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":"10","date":null,"city":"City","region":"Maharashtra","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Gautam Navlakha","victim_keywords":"human rights activist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"P.Varavara Rao","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ujjwala Pawar","victim_keywords":"lawyer","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Arun Ferreira","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vernon Gonsalves","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sudha Bharadwaj","victim_keywords":"Activists","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":878141386,"Input.title":"Jumblatt calls state security a gang, slams presidency and Its \u2018cronies\u2019 \u2013 Ya Libnan","Input.publish_date":"2019-10-08 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Jumblatt calls state security a gang, slams presidency and Its \u2018cronies\u2019<\/p> <p>by yalibnan 1828<\/p> <p>Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblatt blasted on Monday President Michel Aoun\u2019s tenure and labeled the State Security agency a \u201cgang.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cLet the presidential tenure and its cronies be reassured: Every time you arrest one of us, hatred towards you and towards State Security and its gang will increase,\u201d Jumblatt tweeted.<\/p> <p>\u201cNo sirs, the country can\u2019t be ruled through tyranny, oppression, theft and hunger.

His approval rating was over 80 per cent at the height of the pandemic in April and May this year, with Johnson, Trudeau and L\u00f3pez Obrador in the low 60s, while Trump, Macron and Abe all failed to reach 50 per cent. The 2019 elections gave him a second term with a commanding majority of Lok Sabha seats. At the same time, Modi\u2019s record towards his country\u2019s minorities\u2014imposing martial law on Kashmir, excluding Muslims from the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act, quietly tolerating an epidemic of lynchings, burnings and beatings of Muslims and Dalits\u2014has been qualitatively more brutal than that of Bolsonaro or Trump. How should we account for the Modi phenomenon? The starting point of Kapil Komireddi\u2019s Malevolent Republic is that Modi should not be seen as an aberration: that would be \u2018a self-comforting lie\u2019. Instead, Komireddi\u2014a freelance journalist from Hyderabad, now based in the West\u2014offers three reasons for his rise.<\/p> <p>First, Malevolent Republic points to decades of Congress Party failings\u2014above all, the corruption, nepotism, authoritarianism and greed of its ruling family. Although Nehru and Gandhi are absolved, from the 1960s the party became \u2018a sump for Nehru\u2019s parasitical progeny to luxuriate in\u2019. The first half of the book is a ruthless chronological accounting of Congress misdeeds, as leader after leader is excoriated in the run up to Modi: \u2018Erosion\u2019, \u2018Surrender\u2019, \u2018Decadence\u2019, \u2018Dissolution\u2019, run the chapter headings. Nehru\u2019s daughter Indira displayed \u2018despotic impulses\u2019, using Congress \u2018as a laboratory to test her will\u2019, while her son Sanjay lacked even a \u2018residue of democratic inclination\u2019, as exemplified in the slum-clearance and sterilization campaigns he ran during the 1975\u201377 period of Emergency Rule. Millions of people lost their homes as entire districts were bulldozed in Sanjay\u2019s \u2018beautification\u2019 projects, while millions of poor and vulnerable men were dragged under the knife to meet his \u2018family-planning\u2019 targets. Dissenters, defenders of democratic rights, trade unionists, socialists, were imprisoned without charge, the press was heavily censored, foreign journalists expelled and Sanjay glorified by the media.<\/p> <p>After the blowback from Indira\u2019s military assault on the Sikhs\u2019 Golden Temple\u2014she was assassinated in 1984 by her own Sikh bodyguards\u2014her other son, Rajiv, initiated his reign with a pogrom orchestrated by local Congress leaders. Three thousand Sikhs were killed in Delhi, police even disarming Sikh areas before the mob marched in\u2014setting a precedent, Komireddi notes, for the slaughter of Muslims that took place in Gujarat under Modi in 2002. It was Rajiv who ordered that the gates of Ayodhya be opened, allowing Hindu nationalists to lay the foundations for a future temple inside the Babri Mosque. When Muslim leaders protested, Rajiv appeased them by banning Salman Rushdie\u2019s Satanic Verses, having already sabotaged Muslim women\u2019s rights in the Shah Bano case. After Rajiv\u2019s assassination\u2014blowback again: having sent Indian troops into Sri Lanka, he was killed by a Tamil suicide bomber\u2014the new Congress leader, Narasimha Rao, cultivated ties with the bjp, staying silent as the Babri Mosque was destroyed. The Congress Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh, is denounced by Komireddi as a \u2018subcontinental Pinochet\u2019 for his counter-insurgency against the Naxalites and his harsh neoliberal measures, cutting subsidies and handing land over to foreign corporations. Rapid economic growth was accompanied by rising inequality. Demoralized by decades of Congress betrayals, unshackled by Rao and Singh\u2019s neoliberal reforms from Nehruvian ideals of self-restraint, the expanding Hindu middle class was ready to see in the violence of Ayodhya and its follow-ups \u2018a self-empowering, even redemptive, message\u2019.<\/p> <p>Second, Malevolent Republic turns upon India\u2019s \u2018secular historians\u2019 and public intellectuals. Romila Thapar, author of the renowned Penguin History of India, Volume One and many other works on early Indian history, is a particular target. According to Komireddi, these scholars\u2019 \u2018well-intentioned sanitization of the past\u2019 failed to supply an adequate account of the Persian and Moghul imperial invasions of northern India and the centuries of Muslim rule. In the first decades after Independence, he argues, these intellectuals squandered the chance to provide (Hindu) Indians with a forthright narrative of their \u2018ravaged\u2019 heritage\u2014the great mosques built from shattered temple fragments\u2014that could have reconciled them to their \u2018harrowing past\u2019 and allowed a mature detachment from it. Instead, Thapar and her colleagues \u2018papered over the gruesome deeds of the invaders with nice-nellyisms\u2019, preferring to dwell on their cultural achievements. School textbooks presented an idyllic picture of medieval India in which Muslims and Hindus coexisted in harmony, shattered only by the arrival of the British. But the Muslim encounter left a \u2018deep wound\u2019, Komireddi argues. The euphemization of Moghul rule by Thapar and her colleagues had \u2018infantilized Indians\u2019, rendering them susceptible to \u2018the piffle of Hindu nationalists\u2019 who seized the chance to \u2018weaponize history\u2019, portraying Muslims as insensitive to innocent Hindus\u2019 wounded feelings. This, according to Malevolent Republic, provides the second precondition for Modi\u2019s rise: \u2018The confusion of a country that deferred the task of dealing sincerely with its wounded past was ripe for exploitation\u2019.<\/p> <p>Third, Komireddi argues, big-business backing\u2014from the Tatas to the Ambani brothers\u2014and praise from such eminent scholars as Columbia\u2019s Jagdish Bhagwati or Gurcharan Das, Harvard-educated author of India Unbound, were crucial to the bjp\u2019s success. \u2018Intellectuals and industrialists\u2019 polished Modi\u2019s image as a \u2018technocratic modernizer\u2019, celebrated his \u2018vision\u2019 and ability to get things done. And India\u2019s \u2018shameless elites were easily co-opted to pimp for him, asking only for a commitment to the market in return\u2019. Foreign investors, diplomats and politicians made the pilgrimage to Modi\u2019s capital in Gandhinagar for his trade fairs when he was chief minister of Gujarat, from 2001\u201314. Although Gujarat\u2019s growth was accompanied by low social mobility, it was widely presented as the development model of India, with perfect roads, electricity and clean water. Support from the West was equally fulsome, and the 2002 Gujarati massacre soon forgotten. Before the 2014 election, Time magazine listed Modi as one of the world\u2019s most influential leaders, Cameron put on an honour guard for him, Hollande organized a boat ride on the Seine, Obama offered flattery. Hence \u2018there wasn\u2019t a shadow of resistance as Narendra Modi stormed Delhi in the summer of 2014\u2019.<\/p> <p>The second half of Malevolent Republic covers Modi\u2019s record in office. A series of short thematic chapters explore the Modi personality cult (3d holographic projectors beaming his image into villages without electricity); the monstrously bungled \u2018de-monetization\u2019 policy; the rise of cow vigilantes and escalation of anti-Muslim violence; and the assertion of bjp influence across India\u2019s institutions, from the Reserve Bank of India to the universities and Supreme Court. The treatment here is more journalistic; much of the material will be familiar to readers of the international press. On Kashmir and on foreign policy, however, Komireddi emerges as a hard-line hawk. He commends Modi for cutting an \u2018imposing figure on the world stage\u2019, \u2018confidently projecting Delhi as a rival to Beijing\u2019 and \u2018translating his muscular attitude into action\u2019 by sending troops into Bhutan in 2017 to block a Chinese road-building project. He then dismisses him for being insufficiently tough when the Bhutan invasion \u2018collapsed into a desperate face-saving exercise\u2019 after Washington declined to send reinforcements. Above all, the book is suffused with hostility to Pakistan\u2014a \u2018monument to majoritarian bigotry\u2019, gripped by \u2018neurotic nationalism\u2019, ruled by \u2018vultures\u2019. Alone of the many leaders Komireddi discusses, Bhutto, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister in the 1970s, is disparagingly referred to as \u2018Zulfi\u2019 at every point.<\/p> <p>What explains Malevolent Republic\u2019s hyper-aggressive regional-policy line, apparently out-Modi-ing Modi? The answer may lie in Komireddi\u2019s cursus as a journalist. He owes a major debt, he explains, to the mentorship of David Frum, the neoconservative Canadian-American publicist best known for coining the \u2018axis of evil\u2019 slogan for Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union address. In 2009, Frum recruited Komireddi, fresh out of us law school and without a clear idea of what he wanted to do, and funded him to tour Pakistan to produce a 10-part series for the Frum Forum website, under the title \u2018Pakistan: Anatomy of a Failed State\u2019. Frum\u2019s editorializing sets the tone: \u2018India\u2019s success at forging a nationality out of its diversity stood as a towering repudiation of the very idea of Pakistan\u2019\u2014\u2018Pakistan could not succeed unless India failed.\u2019 Or again: \u2018The terrorism with which we contend has its origins in Pakistan as much as in the Arab Middle East. Our friend Kapil Komireddi has returned from traveling inside Pakistan . . .\u2019 Also in 2009, Komireddi\u2014presumably with Frum\u2019s help\u2014published a \u2018stand up to China\u2019 piece in Foreign Policy (\u2018Time for India to play hardball with China\u2019) and a Guardian opinion column on Kashmir: \u2018Over 60 arduous years, India has integrated radically diverse regions under the banner of a pluralistic nationalism. Its failure to achieve that in Kashmir is largely due to Pakistan.\u2019<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3MQY1YVHS5Z4BLTVVJOOOWED8P32BE"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":424,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1975.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"slum-clearance, sterilization, Emergency Rule","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1975.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"slum-clearance, sterilization, Emergency Rule","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":920031144,"Input.title":"Balochistan: Iran executes Baloch political prisoner in Dozzap","Input.publish_date":"2020-04-24 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>DOZZAP (Zahedan): Iranian forces have hanged a Baloch political prisoner in Dozzap [Zahedan] Central Prison in Iranian Occupied Balochistan (IOB) on Thursday.<\/p> <p>According to details, Thursday, 23rd April 2020, the Iranian force carried out the execution of Abdul Basit Dehani.

He was driven to the Stansted airport, where he was to be flown as \u201cdiplomatic baggage\u201d to Lagos to face charges of allegedly stealing $1 billion.<\/p> <p>His captors handcuffed him, drugged him, and stuffed him, in chains, into a specially made crate with a doctor by his side maintaining a tube on his throat to keep him alive.<\/p> <p>The plot flopped when Charles Marrow, the British Customs officer, suspected foul play, got the police to abort the trip. The Buhari junta denied any role in the failed mission, which resulted in a major diplomatic spat between Nigeria and Britain for two years.<\/p> <p>The then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, protested to the Federal Military Government of Nigeria over the kidnapping \u201cwhich is seen as an inexcusable, if not inexplicable abuse of diplomatic status.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u2018Difficult situation\u2019<\/p> <p>Mr Hananiya, the former Nigerian High Commissioner in London, was at the centre of the storm during the abduction saga.<\/p> <p>He quoted an Editorial by the Telegraph, a British broadsheet newspaper, captured the difficult situation he found himself in.<\/p> <p>Advertisements<\/p> <p>Whether positive or negative, any response by the Nigerian High Commissioner to the question of waiving diplomatic immunity on the accused persons was bad for him.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf he refused, everyone would assume that the Nigerian government was indeed involved in the plot to kidnap Dikko\u2026.and if he agreed and Nigerian diplomats were interviewed by the police and subsequently prosecuted and convicted, \u201cthe morals of Major General Buhari\u2019s regime will not be at a premium,\u201d the Telegraph had opined.<\/p> <p>The diplomat, however, chose to \u201cdefend his country,\u201d a decision that made him lose his job as a High Commissioner.<\/p> <p>Frosty diplomatic relationship with the UK<\/p> <p>When the abduction of Mr Dikko failed, the British police promptly detained Nigeria Airways aircraft and arrested four persons in connection to the issue. In retaliation, the Nigerian government also detained a commercial British Caledonian plane carrying 220 passengers in Lagos.<\/p> <p>The four men \u2013 three Israeli nationals and one Nigerian national \u2013 were charged with kidnapping \u2013 a common-law offence and with administering drugs with intent to kidnap.<\/p> <p>When the trials were finally concluded, Alexander Barak, an Israeli described as the leader of the kidnap group, bagged 14 years jail term. Two of his compatriots, Lew Arie Shapiro and Felix Abitbol, received 10 years each, while Mohammed Yesufu, a Nigerian, was sentenced to 12 years.<\/p> <p>The Nigerian and Israeli governments have always denied involvement in the kidnapping.<\/p> <p>The British government also implicated two members of the Nigerian High Commission diplomatic staff members, Peter Oyedele, and Okon Edet, as having engaged in activities \u201cincompatible with their status.\u201d They requested Messrs Oyedele and Edet to leave the United Kingdom within one week.<\/p> <p>Nigeria responded similarly by asking that two persons from the British High Commission also leave Nigeria within the same period.

Most of the employees, because they were civil servants, could not be fired.<\/p> <p>So, prosecutors said, the company's executives tried to make workers' lives so miserable they would leave voluntarily. Lombard, speaking to senior managers in 2007, reportedly vowed, \"I'll get them out one way or another, through the window or through the door.\"<\/p> <p>In the ruling, the court said \"the means chosen to reach 22,000 departures were illegitimate,\" the New York Times reported. It was \"a conscious scheme to worsen the work conditions of the employees in order to speed up departures\" and it \"created a climate of anxiety\" that led to the suicides.<\/p> <p>The employee deaths were often shocking and violent. One man leaped to his death from a highway bridge in the French Alps. Another set himself on fire in the parking lot of the company's office near Bordeaux. At an office in Paris, a woman threw herself from a sixth-floor window.<\/p> <p>In many cases, suicide notes blaming the company accompanied them.

Cox-Berry briefly let go of the girl, and the employee was able to get the children who were also nearby into a classroom, according to a police affidavit.

The coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which support the internationally-recognized Yemeni government, continue to bomb civilian infrastructure and carry out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring thousands of civilians. All parties have also suppressed freedom of expression through arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture, and other ill-treatment in custody.<\/p> <p>Civilians are trapped in the middle of the conflict, and bear the brunt of the violence. To date, more than 233,000 people have been killed and injured. The spiralling humanitarian crisis has left approximately 14 million people on the brink of famine. The situation has been exacerbated by years of poor governance, resulting in poverty and causing immense suffering. An estimated 22 million Yemenis currently require humanitarian assistance to survive.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe unlawful and prolonged detention, torture and other ill-treatment that detained journalists in Yemen face is a shocking reminder of the repressive media climate that still exists in the country,\u201d said Afrah Nasser, Yemen researcher of Human Rights Watch.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3EGKVCRQFY7UC6M2O4VJX0FIN4DYB6"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":358,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2015","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Sana\u2019a","region":"None","country":"Yemen","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Akram al-Walidi","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Abdelkhaleq Amran","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hareth Hamid","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tawfiq al-Mansouri","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, arrested, Yemen, 2018, espionage, spying","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2015","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Sana\u2019a","region":"None","country":"Yemen","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Akram al-Walidi","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Abdelkhaleq Amran","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hareth Hamid","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tawfiq al-Mansouri","victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, espionage, death sentence, Yemen","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, arrested, Yemen, 2018, espionage, spying","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":871337857,"Input.title":"Myanmar journalist thrives amid state, social restrictions","Input.publish_date":"2019-09-09 07:25:31","Input.article_interface":"<p>MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Myanmar journalist Ko Swe Win has managed to thrive in a high-risk profession despite, or perhaps because of, his experience with repression and the political tensions in his home country.<\/p> <p>In his current capacity as editor in chief of independent news service Myanmar Now, Ko Swe Win has turned Myanmar\u2019s attention to stories of keen social relevance and human interest.<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>His two-year investigation of the enslavement of 10,000 prisoners in Myanmar\u2019s rock quarries led to prison reforms as initiated by parliament.

This is because of the success of the NGOs in the accountability level, especially.. our work versus the International Criminal Court in bringing cases.<\/p> <p>Shawan Jabarin of the human rights group Al-Haq also said his organization had \u201ccrossed the red line\u201d when it assisted the ICC investigation of Israeli war crimes. Israel tried to dry up Al-Haq\u2019s funding, and failed, and also targeted the group with \u201cMafia methods,\u201d including death threats.<\/p> <p>[When we] go after the commanders and key figures, those who are complicit in war crimes \u2014 this is the red line for them. Because all the time they claim that they are the only democracy in this region, but the facts show a completely different story\u2026 They try to shut us down, they try to send fear when they put roses of funerals behind the doors of our colleagues, those who work in the Hague\u2026 This is Mafia methods they use\u2026 They failed in their process. They have been contacting our funders and our partners for so long and they have failed to dry up our resources. This [terrorist designation] is the last bullet in their hand and this is a political bullet because it has no legal basis and no security basis\u2026 They will not silence us.<\/p> <p>Ubai Al-Aboudi of the Bisan Center for Research and Development said that Israel first sought to close the organizations through its military law system. But it was never able to bring \u201creal charges\u201d so it turned to the rightwing NGOs to push spurious claims against the organizations in international fora. Those groups include UK Lawyers for Israel, UN Watch, NGO Monitor, and Regavim.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe right wing organizations\u2026 make absolutely ridiculous claims\u2026by the motto, \u2018If you repeat the lie enough, people will start believing.\u2019 People didn\u2019t start to believe them. But they start to believe it themselves.<\/p> <p>Israel presented its dossiers of secret evidence to EU ambassadors a couple of months ago, Al-Aboudi said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe began to hear statements from them, there is no evidence and substance to the claims.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is state terrorism at its finest hour,\u201d Al-Aboudi said, and described the European rejection of the evidence.<\/p> <p>They presented their so-called evidence dossier back in May through the Belgiums. We have a joint program supported through a Belgian NGO by [the Belgian government]\u2026 The Belgians did their own investigation. The Belgian minister in charge of international cooperation went in front of parliament said this is propaganda\u2026 There is no proof in the file.\u201d<\/p> <p>Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz lately told the Jerusalem Post, We talked to the EU and it refused to stop funding for the organizations, so Israel took this step of designating the organizations as terrorist, Al-Aboudi said.<\/p> <p>\u201cEvidence wise they have nothing,\u201d Al-Aboudi said. If Israel had real evidence it would have attacked the organizations. Any independent professional investigation would show that the dossier is based on \u201clibel, propaganda and just lies.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen we tell them, OK present that [secret evidence], let us have a chance to review the evidence, they say no we won\u2019t do it. This is state terrorism at its finest hour. Our only hope is to rely on the free people of the world to pressure their Congress, their parliament members and to pressure their governments to act and defend human rights. \u201cWhat\u2019s being targeted today is civil society, what\u2019s being targeted today is the truth, what\u2019s being targeted today is not just our work as civil society but international civil society.\u201d<\/p> <p>Sahar Francis said that the so-called evidence was gathered by Israeli security services from the military courts. She said the report was submitted in May to European government.<\/p> <p>Most of this information is based on confessions by Palestinian prisoners who are tortured and ill-treated systematically in these interrogation centers\u2026 The report\u2013 pieces were taken from interrogation sessions, and the confessions of these two prisoners out of five or six prisoners arrested\u2026<\/p> <p>Francis represents one of the prisoners, so she has seen the evidence but can\u2019t disclose it due to the military court procedure. But she knows it to be very weak, she said.<\/p> <p>Francis said the entire case is a manipulation of anti-terror laws to punish \u201chuman rights organizations that are struggling with their people to achieve self determination.\u201d Israel has used these laws for decades to target critics and to advance its annexation of the West Bank and Jerusalem.<\/p> <p>She noted that Israel\u2019s \u201cterrorist\u201d designation relies on the claim that the six organizations are tied to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. But Francis said Israel could have used any Palestinian party for this pretext, including Hamas and Fatah.<\/p> <p>Let me remind you that all the parties included in the PLO are still declared illegal in Israeli military orders and inside Israel which means that they can claim against Mr. Mahmoud Abbas himself as the Fatah leader as a criminal terrorist person. They can criminalize everyone and claim based on secret information that he is a terrorist.<\/p> <p>Shawan Jabarin of Al-Haq said he has seen the dossier that was given to Europeans and it is laughable.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is nothing\u2026. They try to throw the dust everywhere.\u201d<\/p> <p>He called on the international community to reject the allegations forcefully.<\/p> <p>I ask the US, are you willing to accept false allegation. are you ready to accept secret file. Are you ready to target civil society?\u2026 This is a test for the U.S., for the E.U., for everybody who believes in international law, human rights law and democratic standards. Palestine is a test, even a test for the international law itself\u2026 This is where we are. We will not step back. We will not give up. And the main approach is we are challenging them to prove what they say.<\/p> <p>Jabarin echoed a report in Electronic Intifada saying the EU has shown \u201cdeference\u201d to Israel over the allegations.<\/p> <p>The E.U.\u2013they didn\u2019t take a strong position. You know why? Because the E.U. is divided. There are also friends of Israel. There are also parliamentarians who receive messages from Tel Aviv not from their capitals even.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe hope is coming in the U.S. from the new generation, the progressives,\u201d Jabarin said.<\/p> <p>Fuad Abu Saif of the Union of Agricultural Workers Committees said that European donors have dismissed the Israeli report but they should speak out.<\/p> <p>One encouraging thing\u2026 They give the donors all the so-called evidence. But even the donors we had a chat with them, they are not believing what they have in their files. But you have to raise your voice, you have to response to it.<\/p> <p>Khaled Elgindy of the Middle East Institute, a sponsor of the discussion, expressed the fear that the international outrage over the Israeli designation would produce \u201clots of handwringing, a lot of disapproval,\u201d but that in the end the EU and the US will not reject the allegations but acquiesce in them.<\/p> <p>Ubai Al-Aboudi noted that he is a U.S. citizen and so are others working for the six organizations.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo we would expect Congress and we would expect the Biden administration\u2026 to take all the measures necessary to communicate with us before takiing any step.\u201d<\/p> <p>Khaled Quzmar of DCIP said the secret dossier is a \u201ctest\u201d of the Biden administration.<\/p> <p>For the Biden administration, this is the test. Are they going to continue with words and no action? It will be no different from the Trump administration. [If there is] no political will to hold Israel responsible for crimes, I conclude that they are partner in the crimes.<\/p> <p>Jabarin said that the U.S. should be aware that the case is undermining the Palestinian Authority by closing \u201call doors\u201d to justice.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe people they can ask, You can\u2019t protect our land, you can\u2019t protect our life, you can\u2019t protect our institutions, why you are here?\u201d<\/p> <p>He said that Al-Haq\u2019s funders and our partners \u201care doubling their funding to us. We have no lack of funding, to be honest with you.\u201d<\/p> <p>But the big question is whether the U.S. will prevent Palestinians organizations from getting money from banks under the terrorist claim.<\/p> <p>Sahar Francis called on the U.S. to pressure Israel now to withdraw the designation.<\/p> <p>[The designation] needs to be revoked under political pressure from around the world. It\u2019s the U.S. responsibility.

Sixteen Americans and one Canadian were abducted, along with their Haitian driver.<\/p> <p>The missionaries are with Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, which held a news conference before someone posted the video of the gang leader.<\/p> <p>Weston Showalter, spokesman for the religious group, said that the families of those who'd been kidnapped are from Amish, Mennonite and other conservative Anabaptist communities in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Ontario, Canada. He read a letter from the families, who weren't identified by name, in which they said, \"God has given our loved ones the unique opportunity to live out our Lord's command to love your enemies.\"<\/p> <p>The group invited people to join them in prayer for the kidnappers as well as those kidnapped and expressed gratitude for help from \"people that are knowledgeable and experienced in dealing with\" such situations.<\/p> <p>\"Pray for these families,\" Showalter said. \"They are in a difficult spot.\"<\/p> <p>The gang leader's death threat added to the already intense concern in and around Holmes County, Ohio, where Christian Aid Ministries is based and has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Amish, conservative Mennonite and related groups. Many members of those groups have supported the organization through donations or by volunteering at its warehouse.<\/p> <p>\"These kinds of things erase some of the boundaries that exist within our circles,\" added Marcus Yoder, executive director of the Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center in Millersburg.<\/p> <p>\"Many people in the community feel helpless, but they also realize the power of prayer and the power of our historic theology,\" he said, including the Anabaptist belief in nonresistance to violence.<\/p> <p>The same day that the missionaries were kidnapped, a gang also abducted a Haiti university professor, according to a statement that Haiti's ombudsman-like Office of Citizen Protection issued on Tuesday.

Muslims of India on September 11, 1948<\/p> <p>Barrister Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the greatest leader of the country, parted ways with us and a novice state and its people became helpless as soon as they became independent.<\/p> <p>September 11, 2012 was a bloody day when a tragedy took place in Ali Enterprise site Baldia Town in which 260 innocent workers were killed. These innocent were crushed and burnt to death in the building, leaving a lasting stain on our country\u2019s administrative. Another incident happened on 9\/11 World Trade Tower that is unforgettable incident that killed thousands of people.<\/p> <p>US forces invaded Afghanistan, terrorism escalated and millions in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a result of this war, innocent people lost their life, which, God forbid, should now come to an end. In the month of September in history, we also find the names of many such personalities, whose memories make the society to mourn with grief. It is a historical fact that Labor leaders fought for the rights of the working people in this country and these brave labour leaders endured long hardships of incarceration for the protection of the rights of the people.<\/p> <p>Their families suffered economic ruin, but they continued their struggle and never gave up their struggle. One of the great labor leaders, Usman Ghani, was martyred who sacrificed his life in this struggle and was martyred at the hands of terrorists. Today we are celebrating his 26th death anniversary.<\/p> <p>Usman Ghani is basically one of the finest people in Pakistan. He was associated with the Pakistan People\u2019s Party. He started his professional life by getting a job in Muslim Commercial Bank Limited<\/p> <p>He was arguably one of the strongest opponents of capitalism and feudalism. Based on his thinking and his strong commitment to the working class, in 1972, Usman was elected Central President of the Muslim Commercial Bank of Pakistan.<\/p> <p>He always fought the war of employees\u2019 interests with courage. For the rights of the employees of Muslim Commercial Bank, the efforts he put in, are unforgettable. He was first arrested in 1973 for not compromising on the rights and demands of the employees. At a time when he was addressing a protest rally in the central hall of the bank to emphasize the acquisition of profit bonuses for employees, on the behest of the bank management, the police force climbed on the stage while charging the baton and in the darkness of the night he was taken into custody and was shifted to Central Jail Karachi.<\/p> <p>Usman Ghani was not only one of the most popular leaders of Muslim Commercial Bank but also as a result of his struggle, he held a prominent position in Pakistan\u2019s banking industry\u2019s trade unions and labor movement. As well as participating in trade union activities, he was a very active leader in Pakistan\u2019s democratic politics as well.<\/p> <p>He took full part in the restoration of democracy under the leadership of Mohtarma Shaheed Benazir Bhutto and in this regard he had to endure the hardships of imprisonment. His services for democratic movement were highly valued by Mohtarma Shaheed Benazir Bhutto and she twice praised him in the general public. He was also awarded the Provincial Assembly seat in the elections. Shaheed Usman Ghani not only had to go behind the bars under the rule of military dictator and in the PML-N government, but he also endured the hardships of imprisonment even during the rule of his own party, the Pakistan People\u2019s Party. because he preferred to go to jail for the interests of the labourers, instead of compromising his principles.<\/p> <p>The last arrest of his life was made in February 1991 during Nawaz Sharif government. It came into action at a time when the CBA unions of more than 160 nationally owned entities in Pakistan were protesting against privatisation.<\/p> <p>Shaheed Usman Ghani and the writer of this article were kept in jail for many months. In the meantime, the government of the day sold the Muslim Commercial Bank to the private sector. Now the situation had changed. Despite the changed environment and the hard-working attitude of the private bank management, Usman Ghani worked very hard and patiently and restoring the fragmented time of the practical workers and restored the lost reputation of the trade union again in a very short time. He made trade unions an invincible force in bank once and for all. Usman Ghani started a new and determined era of his life but the forces hostile to the workers\u2019 movement and the democratic system, decided something else against the people.<\/p> <p>On September 17, 1995, in a very unfortunate incident, the martyred leader left his residence at Chanesar Goth for his office and in the middle of the bridge, unknown ruthless assassins attacked and separated this selfless leader of the workers from his fellows forever.<\/p> <p>Although Shaheed Usan Ghani is no more with us, but his memory and the sacrifices he made for the workers are still fresh in our minds. His efforts for the restoration of rights and democracy will live forever in the history. For the working class, it is also a source of satisfaction that the struggle and the sacrifices made by Usman Ghani has been taken up by his son Saeed Ghani. He possesses dynamic and progressive leadership qualities. He is the president of Pakistan Peoples Party Karachi division and provincial minister for labour.<\/p> <p>We, on behalf of the working class, stand by his side and we also pray for the success of the son of the martyr.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3KG2UQJ0ML3N4DKD0KJYB9CA5KAQNK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":742,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1973","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Karachi","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Usman Ghani","victim_keywords":"banker, activist, union leader, repeat arrests, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1973","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Karachi","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Usman Ghani","victim_keywords":"banker, activist, union leader, repeat arrests, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":976280680,"Input.title":"Viral Video Shows IDF Arresting Vegetable-Picking Palestinian Kids at Behest of Israeli Settlers","Input.publish_date":"2021-03-24 07:55:00-05:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>OCCUPIED WEST BANK \u2014 On March 10, five Palestinian boys hoped to spend their day foraging for vegetables south of their home in the occupied West Bank.

The two older boys, ages 12 and 13 \u2014 were called back into the police station for questioning on March 21 because they are over the age of criminal responsibility, which is 12 according to Israeli law.

And this brutality begins from the moment of arrest and continues to the interrogation phase, the detention phase \u2014 during the whole process children are subject to brutality by the Israeli occupation forces.\u201d<\/p> <p>Defense for Children International \u2013 Palestine (DCIP) estimates that Israeli forces detain and prosecute 500 to 700 children between the ages of 12 and 17 every year. According to Addameer, 140 children are currently imprisoned by Israel and two are under administrative detention, where Israeli authorities detain an individual without charge. The reason for the detention is unknown to the detainee and lawyer, and considered a matter of security.<\/p> <p>In some cases of child detention, DCIP said, \u201cIsraeli forces\u2019 treatment may amount to torture.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cNearly three-quarters of children have reported to DCIP that they were subjected to physical violence at the hands of Israeli forces, and close to 60% are verbally abused, humiliated and intimidated, most often during their arrest and subsequent transfer to an interrogation center,\u201d Shaina Low, advocacy officer at DCIP said in an email. She continued:<\/p> <p>Nearly all children (95%) have their hands bound and around 86% are blindfolded. The vast majority of children (85%) are not informed of the reason for arrest, and two-thirds of children are not properly informed of their rights. Nearly all children are interrogated without a parent present, and children have no right to an attorney during interrogation. One third of children report being threatened and coerced into confessing.\u201d<\/p> <p>Yet while detention can be physically tormenting for children, the psychological aspect of it is what stays with children in the long-term.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a social thing for Palestinians,\u201d Addameer\u2019s Ansari said. \u201cWhen children get detained and imprisoned, they become men and it deprives them from living their innocence and imposes on them to become tough and try to overcome the obstacles that they are under.\u201d<\/p> <p>International outcry<\/p> <p>\u201cIt was so disturbing seeing those heavily armed Israeli soldiers detaining small, terrified Palestinian children,\u201d Rep.

The House letter, whose dozen signatories included Rep. McCollum, covered Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, the issue of annexation, and Israel\u2019s obligation under international law to vaccinate all Palestinians. The letter specified:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe request that the State Department undertake an investigation into Israel\u2019s possible use of U.S. equipment in these home demolitions and determine whether these materials have been used in violation of the Arms Export Control Act or any U.S.-Israeli end-use agreements\u2026<\/p> <p>\u201cIsrael\u2019s ongoing colonization of the Palestinian West Bank, including East Jerusalem, alongside its demolition of Palestinian homes, is a form of ongoing, de facto annexation, which needs to be unequivocally opposed by the United States\u2026<\/p> <p>\u201cThe message from this Administration must be clear: settler colonialism in any form \u2014 including Israel\u2019s settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank \u2014 is illegal under international law and will not be tolerated.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Senate letter urged President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to pressure Israel to vaccinate all Palestinians. The letter was signed by five senators, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.<\/p> <p>Traditionally, American politicians have turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s crimes against Palestinians.

Few, least of all in the media, cared much about his pattern of lying until now. Indeed, most observers have long pointed out that his popularity was based on his mischief-making and his populist guise as an anti-establishment politician. No one, apart from his political opponents, seemed too bothered.<\/p> <p>The sudden chorus of outrage at Johnson impugning Starmer\u2019s reputation is strange in many different ways. It is not as though Johnson has a record of good behaviour. His whole political persona is built on the idea of his being a rascal, a clown, a chancer.<\/p> <p>Johnson accused Starmer, who at the time was Director of Public Prosecutions, of wasting \u201chis time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile\u201d.<\/p> <p>The reason? Last week the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, blamed Starmer, now the Labour party leader, for failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile, a TV presenter and serial child abuser, when his case came under police review in 2009. Between 2008 and 2013, Starmer was head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Savile died in 2011 before he could face justice.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhy is Boris Johnson making false claims about Starmer and Savile?\u201d runs a headline in the news pages of the Guardian. It is just one of a barrage of indignant recent stories in the British media, rushing to the defence of the opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer.<\/p> <p>My latest: The media's watchdog role is an illusion. The current scandal over Boris Johnson's lockdown parties reveals just how dependent journalists are on government https:\/\/t.co\/BxykcG3qfc<\/p> <p>But it was Johnson\u2019s criticisms of Starmer, not partygate, that led several of his senior advisers last week to resign their posts. One can at least suspect that in their case \u2013 given how quickly the Johnson brand is sinking, and the repercussions they may face from a police investigation into the partygate scandal \u2013 that finding an honorable pretext for jumping ship may have been the wisest move.<\/p> <p>But there is something deeply strange about Johnson\u2019s own Conservative MPs and the British media lining up to express their indignation at Johnson\u2019s attack on Starmer, a not particularly liked or likable opposition leader, and then turning it into the reason to bring down a prime minister whose other flaws are only too visible.<\/p> <p>What makes the situation even weirder is that Johnson\u2019s so-called \u201csmears\u201d of Starmer may not actually be smears at all. They look like rare examples of Johnson alluding to \u2013 admittedly in his own clumsy and self-interested way \u2013 genuinely problematic behaviour by Starmer.<\/p> <p>One would never know this from the coverage, of course.<\/p> <p>Here is the Guardian supposedly fact-checking Johnson\u2019s attack on Starmer under the apparently neutral question: \u201cIs there any evidence that Starmer was involved in any decision not to prosecute Savile?\u201d<\/p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s answer is decisive:<\/p> <p>No. The CPS has confirmed that there is no reference to any involvement from Starmer in the decision-making within an official report examining the case. Surrey police consulted the CPS for advice about the allegations after interviewing Savile\u2019s victims, according to a 2013 CPS statement made by Starmer as DPP. The official report, written by Alison Levitt QC, found that in October 2009 the CPS lawyer responsible for the cases \u2013 who was not Starmer \u2013 advised that no prosecution could be brought on the grounds that none of the complainants were \u2018prepared to support any police action\u2019.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s a pretty definite \u201cNo\u201d, then. Not \u201cNo, according to Starmer\u201d. Or \u201cNo, according to the CPS\u201d. Or \u201cNo, according to an official report\u201d \u2013 and doubtless a determinedly face-saving one at that \u2013 into the Savile scandal.<\/p> <p>Just \u201cNo\u201d.<\/p> <p>Here is the Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker echoing how cut and dried the corporate media\u2019s assessment is: \u201c[Starmer] had no connection to decisions over the case, and the idea he did emerged later in conspiracy theories mainly shared among the far right.\u201d<\/p> <p>So it\u2019s just a far-right conspiracy theory. Case against Starmer closed.<\/p> <p>But not so fast.<\/p> <p>Given Savile\u2019s tight ties to the establishment \u2013 from royalty and prime ministers down \u2013 and the establishment\u2019s role in providing, however inadvertently, cover for Savile\u2019s paedophilia for decades, it should hardly surprise us that the blame for the failure to prosecute him has been placed squarely on the shoulders of a low-level lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service. How it could be otherwise? If we started unpicking the thorny Savile knot, who knows how the threads might unravel?<\/p> <p>Sacrificial victim<\/p> <p>Former ambassador Craig Murray has made an interesting observation about Johnson\u2019s remark on Starmer. Murray, let us remember, has been a first-hand observer and chronicler of the dark arts of the establishment in protecting itself from exposure, after he himself was made a sacrificial victim for revealing the British government\u2019s illegal involvement in torture and extraordinary rendition.<\/p> <p>My latest: The refusal to hear Craig Murray\u2019s appeal against his unprecedented conviction for \u2018jigsaw identification\u2019 means the British state has now effectively been given the power to license journalists https:\/\/t.co\/czxg9VNtnU \u2014 Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) July 30, 2021<\/p> <p>As Murray notes:<\/p> <p>Of course the Director of Public Prosecutions does not handle the individual cases, which are assigned to lawyers under them. But the Director most certainly is then consulted on the decisions in the high profile and important cases. That is why they are there. It is unthinkable that Starmer was not consulted on the decision to shelve the Savile case \u2013 what do they expect us to believe his role was, as head of the office, ordering the paperclips?<\/p> <p>And of the official inquiry into Starmer\u2019s role that cleared him of any wrongdoing, the one that so impresses the Guardian and everyone else, Murray adds:<\/p> <p>When the public outcry reached a peak in 2012, Starmer played the go-to trick in the Establishment book. He commissioned an \u201cindependent\u201d lawyer he knew to write a report exonerating him. Mistakes have been made at lower levels, lessons will be learnt\u2026 you know what it says. Mishcon de Reya, money launderers to the oligarchs, provided the lawyer to do the whitewash. Once he retired from the post of DPP, Starmer went to work at, umm,\u2026<\/p> <p>Yes, Mischon de Reya.<\/p> <p>Delighted to be joining Mishcon de Reya and to remain with Doughty Street Chambers under new dual capacity rules http:\/\/t.co\/ejoBDIxImK \u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) June 23, 2014<\/p> <p>Starmer and Assange<\/p> <p>Murray also notes that MPs and the British media have resolutely focused attention on Starmer\u2019s alleged non-role in the Savile decision \u2013 where an \u201cofficial report\u201d provides them with cover \u2013 rather than an additional, and far more embarrassing, point made by Johnson about Starmer\u2019s behaviour as Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p> <p>The prime minister mentioned Starmer using his time to \u201cprosecute journalists\u201d. Johnson and the media have no interest in clarifying that reference. Anyway, Johnson only made it for effect: as a contrast to the way Starmer treated Savile, as a way to highlight that, when he chose to, Starmer was quite capable of advancing a prosecution.<\/p> <p>But this second point is potentially far more revealing both of Starmer\u2019s misconduct as Director of Public Prosecutions and about the services he rendered to the establishment \u2013 the likely reason why he was knighted at a relatively young age, becoming \u201cSir\u201d Keir.<\/p> <p>The journalist referenced by Johnson was presumably Julian Assange, currently locked up in Belmarsh high-security prison in London as lawyers try to get him extradited to the United States for his exposure of US war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.<\/p> <p>At an early stage of Assange\u2019s persecution, the Crown Prosecution Service under Starmer worked overtime \u2013 despite Britain\u2019s official position of neutrality in the case \u2013 to ensure he was extradited to Sweden. Assange sought political asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012, when Starmer was still head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Assange did so because he got wind of efforts by the Americans to extradite him onwards from Sweden to the US. He feared the UK would collude in that process.<\/p> <p>Assange, it turns out, was not wrong. With the Swedish investigation dropped long ago, the British courts are now, nearly a decade on, close to agreeing to the Biden administration\u2019s demand that Assange be extradited to the US \u2013 both to silence him and to intimidate any other journalists who might try to throw a light on US war crimes.<\/p> <p>My latest: It is the ultimate, ugly paradox that Julian Assange\u2019s legal and physical fate rests in the hands of two states \u2013 the US and UK \u2013 that have the most to lose by allowing him to regain his freedom and publish more of the truths they want concealed https:\/\/t.co\/M7WTKq0ZXf \u2014 Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) December 17, 2021<\/p> <p>The Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi has been pursuing a lengthy legal battle to have the CPS emails from Starmer\u2019s time released under a Freedom of Information request. She has been opposed by the British establishment every step of the way. We know that many of the email chains relating to Assange were destroyed by the Crown Prosecution Service \u2013 apparently illegally. Those would doubtless have shone a much clearer light on Starmer\u2019s role in the case \u2013 possibly the reason they were destroyed.<\/p> <p>The small number of emails that have been retrieved show that the Crown Prosecution Service under Starmer micro-managed the Swedish investigation of Assange, even bullying Swedish prosecutors to pursue the case when they had started to lose interest for lack of evidence. In one email from 2012, a CPS lawyer warned his Swedish counterpart: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare get cold feet!!!\u201d. In another from 2011, the CPS lawyer writes: \u201cPlease do not think this case is being dealt with as just another extradition.\u201d<\/p> <p>Prosecutors arm-twisted<\/p> <p>Again, the idea that Starmer was not intimately involved in the decision to arm-twist Swedish prosecutors into persecuting a journalist \u2013 a case that the UK should formally have had no direct interest in, unless it was covertly advancing US interests to silence Assange \u2013 beggars belief.<\/p> <p>Despite the media\u2019s lack of interest in Assange\u2019s plight, the energy expended by the US to get Assange behind bars in the US and redefine national security journalism as espionage shows how politically and diplomatically important this case has always been to the US \u2013 and by extension, the British establishment. There is absolutely no way the deliberations were handled by a single lawyer. Starmer would have closely overseen his staff\u2019s dealings with Swedish prosecutors and authorised what was in practice a political decision, not legal one, to persecute Assange \u2013 or as United Nations experts defined it, \u201carbitrarily detain\u201d him.<\/p> <p>My latest: Lies about UN body threaten not just Julian Assange https:\/\/t.co\/AKiTmP8VL5 #Assange #unwgad \u2014 Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) February 5, 2016<\/p> <p>Neither Murray nor I have unique, Sherlock-type powers of deduction that allow us to join the dots in ways no one else can manage. All of this information is in the public realm, and all of it is known to the editors of the British media. They are not only choosing to avoid mentioning it in the context of the current row, but they are actively fulminating against Boris Johnson for having done so.<\/p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s crime isn\u2019t that he has \u201csmeared\u201d Starmer. It is that \u2013 out of desperate self-preservation \u2013 he has exposed the dark underbelly of the establishment. He has broken the elite\u2019s omerta, its vow of silence. He has made the unpardonable sin of grassing up the establishment to which he belongs. He has potentially given ammunition to the great unwashed to expose the establishment\u2019s misdeeds, to blow apart its cover story. That is why the anger is far more palpable and decisive about Johnson smearing Starmer than it ever was when Johnson smeared the rest of us by partying on through the lockdowns.<\/p> <p>Scorched-earth tactic?<\/p> <p>Look at this headline on Jonathan Freedland\u2019s latest column for the Guardian, visibly aquiver with anger at the way Johnson has defamed Starmer: \u201cJohnson\u2019s Savile smear was the scorched-earth tactic of a desperate, dangerous man\u201d.<\/p> <p>A prime minister attacking the opposition leader \u2013 something we would normally think of as a largely unexceptional turn of political events, and all the more so under Johnson \u2013 has been transformed by Freedland into a dangerous, scorched-earth tactic.<\/p> <p>Quite how preposterous, and hypocritical, this claim is should not need underscoring. Who really needs to be reminded of how Freedland and the rest of media class \u2013 but especially Freedland \u2013 treated Stramer\u2019s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn? That really was a scorched-earth approach. There was barely a day in his five years leading the Labour party when the media did not fabricate the most outrageous lies about Corbyn and his party. He was shabby and unstatesmanlike (unlike the smartly attired Johnson!), sexist, a traitor, a threat to national security, an anti-semite, and much more.<\/p> <p>Anyone like Freedland who actively participated in the five-year campaign of demonisation of Corbyn has no credibility whatsoever either complaining about the supposed mistreatment of Starmer (a pale shadow of what Corbyn suffered) or decrying Johnson\u2019s lowering of standards in public life.<\/p> <p>We have the right-wing populist Johnson in power precisely because Freedland and the rest of the media relentlessly smeared the democratic socialist alternative. In the 2017 election, let us recall, Corbyn was only 2,000 votes from winning. The concerted campaign of smears from across the entire corporate media \u2013 and the resulting manipulation of the public mood \u2013 was the difference between Corbyn winning and the Tories holding on to power.<\/p> <p>Corbyn was destroyed \u2013 had to be destroyed \u2013 because he threatened establishment interests. He challenged the interests of the rich, of the corporations, of the war industries, of the Israel lobby. That was why an anonymous military general warned in the pages of the establishment\u2019s newspaper, The Times, that there would be a mutiny if Corbyn ever reached 10 Downing Street. That was why soldiers were filmed using an image of Corbyn as target practice on a firing range in Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>Johnson\u2019s desperate \u201csmears\u201d aside, none of this will ever happen to Starmer. There will be no threats of mutiny and his image will never used for target practice by the army. Sir Keir won\u2019t be defamed by the billionaire-owned media. Rather, they have demonstrated that they have his back. They will even promote him over an alumnus of the Bullingdon Club, when the blokey toff\u2019s shine starts to wear off.<\/p> <p>And that, it should hardly need pointing out, is because Sir Keir Starmer is there to protect not the public\u2019s interests but the interests of the establishment, just as he did so conscientiously when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3AQN9REUTHVNR3KM20MPSQ3IQPPYDD"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":2702,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"Belmarsh high-security prison, London, US war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"Belmarsh high-security prison, London, US war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":894257592,"Input.title":"eSwatini opposition leaders, activists targeted in police raids","Input.publish_date":"2019-12-20 15:25:40","Input.article_interface":"<p>MBABANE (Reuters) - Police in eSwatini arrested the head of the southern African country\u2019s largest opposition party and several other politicians and activists in raids on their houses on Friday, their parties said.<\/p> <p>FILE PHOTO: Swaziland's King Mswati III and his spouse Siphelele Mashwama greet journalists after attending the inauguration of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo for the second term, at the House of Representatives in Jakarta, Indonesia, October 20, 2019.

For the fifth year in a row, the country has maintained the ignominious world title for impunity towards killed journalists. The Somali authorities rarely investigate cases of killings or attacks on journalists, media outlets and critics.<\/p> <p>At least eight journalists have been killed in south central Somalia and Puntland in the past three years. Four of the journalists (including a cameraman who was shot dead by a policeman) were killed in 2018, two in 2019 and two others in 2020.<\/p> <p>Another journalist survived \u2013 albeit with serious injuries \u2013 an attempt on his life after a bomb attached to his car was remotely detonated in December 2018.<\/p> <p>No one has been arrested for the killings or the attempted murder of these journalists.<\/p> <p>To an unprecedented level, assaults and targeted incidents of attacks on journalists have risen. More than 30 such assaults were recorded in 2018 with the majority of them particularly targeting journalists who were covering stories at national events, at blast sites covering the aftermath of Al-Shabaab attacks, during demonstrations against government policies and while going through security checkpoints in Mogadishu.<\/p> <p>Apart from these, the authorities in Mogadishu, those in Puntland as well as in Somaliland, have raided and temporarily closed media outlets to prevent or discourage coverage of news events, to extort money from media owners or as retaliation against the media outlet for being critical.<\/p> <p>The year 2019 also ended as multiple actors continued to target journalists and media professionals in Somalia. While the number of journalists killed in Somalia was considerably less than in previous years, the level of arbitrary arrests, attacks and suspensions remained high in 2019 across Somalia.<\/p> <p>According to data compiled by the Somali Journalists Syndicate (SJS), 53 cases of arbitrary arrests were recorded. There were also 81 incidents of physical assaults. Three of these journalists were severely wounded, two of them after being shot.<\/p> <p>There were also death threats against journalists, and obstruction of access to information during the year.<\/p> <p>Seven media houses were also shut across the country during 2019. Police in Puntland were extremely aggressive to the media and carried out four raids on independent media houses for investigative news reports deemed critical of the state.<\/p> <p>The politically sensitive elections that took place in the regional states during 2019 could partially explain the high level of state-led attacks on the press. According to interviews with journalists, officials routinely ordered the detention of journalists as an intimidation exercise to quell critical stories. This trend may explain why the majority of journalists\u2019 detentions took place without any charges presented across Somalia in 2019.<\/p> <p>Key red lines for coverage remain across the country. In 2019, there were at least 15 incidents of preventing journalists from covering bombing sites and other security related incidents in Mogadishu. Other areas such as reporting on human rights abuses, especially those perpetrated by state actors, remain another \u201cno-go\u201d area for the Somali press. Online expression is further curbed after state actors repeatedly targeted and harassed journalists on the Internet for any critical personal social media posts.<\/p> <p>Further, in 2019 alone, 12 journalists were forced into exile for fear of imprisonment or death at the hands of Al-Shabaab or from officials of the Somali government and regional states. With a deteriorating press freedom environment, the use of restrictive laws and the criminalization of critical reporting, Somaliland, where the government crackdown on independent media and journalists scaled up during 2019, is on the top of the list of places journalists fled during the year, followed by Jubbaland, Mogadishu and Puntland.<\/p> <p>The situation has not, however, improved in 2020. Just in the first five months of the year, two journalists were murdered. On 16 February 2020, armed assailants in Afgoye, a town just about 30km from the capital, assassinated 25-year-old freelance journalist Abdiwali Ali Hassan while he was returning from work and on 4 May 2020, at least one attacker armed with a knife fatally stabbed journalist Said Yusuf Ali, a reporter for the local Kalsan TV. According to the journalist\u2019s family, despite an initial police report about the arrest of the killer, no credible investigation was opened and no justice was served.<\/p> <p>Eight other journalists, including a female TV reporter, have been wounded in the line of duty this year. The police and government officials perpetrated two of these incidents.<\/p> <p>Moreover on June 25, 2020, a uniformed Somali police officer shot and injured a journalist, Abdifatah Abduqadir Sharif, as he was leaving work to head to his home in Mogadishu. On May 4, 2020, a group of police and officials assaulted and injured Shabelle TV female reporter Safiya Aden Osman and her cameraman Abdulkadir Ga\u2019al while they were covering a protest in Mogadishu. Authorities have failed to open any credible investigation to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book.<\/p> <p>As of the end of September, about 32 journalists have been arbitrarily arrested countrywide with most of them briefly detained and released without charge. However, two journalists, Abdiaziz Ahmed Gurbiye from Goobjoog Media and Mohamed Abduwahab Abuuja, were jailed for an extended period by the authorities in Mogadishu. Gurbiye was arrested on April 14, 2020 after he wrote an article alleging that the President had taken away a donated ventilator from a local hospital. He was later released after paying a fine. Abuuja on the other hand was detained on March 7, 2020 and held incommunicado for five months for writing an article criticizing the Somali security forces. He was taken to the Military Court on treason and terrorism charges and was freed in August after the court quashed the charges due to lack of evidence.<\/p> <p>At least five media houses have been raided and shuttered across the country this year. The federal police, the National Intelligence and Security Forces (NISA) and the regional security forces are the main perpetrators of these violations.<\/p> <p>To further worsen the already alarming press freedom conditions, the Federal President, Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo in late July signed a draconian media law which imposes further restrictions on the independent media and even forces journalists to register on a government-run database or face losing their accreditations.<\/p> <p>The vaguely worded provisions, such as those prohibiting reporting on issues conflicting with \u201cnational interest\u201d, \u201cspreading false information\u201d, \u201cincitement to violence and clannism\u201d as well as \u201cdissemination of propaganda\u201d, also permit the state Attorney General to prosecute journalists. The Ministry of Information also has a broad mandate to regulate media and media practitioners and could simply bar certain individuals from practicing their journalistic profession.<\/p> <p>There is a grave concern about the chilling effect that this media law will have on the right to freedom of expression. The fear over this new Law has already resulted in journalists and media outlets having to resort to self-censorship.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Somali authorities in the capital and in the regional states continue to use the country\u2019s outdated Penal Code that was first adopted in 1964, to prosecute and charge journalists.<\/p> <p>The Penal Code also limits freedom of expression by criminalizing various forms of expression and conduct by journalists such as:<\/p> <p>defamation,<\/p> <p>offending the honour and prestige of the head of state,<\/p> <p>publication or dissemination of false, exaggerated or tendentious news,<\/p> <p>insulting a public officer or institution,<\/p> <p>contempt against the nation, state or flag, or Islamic religion.<\/p> <p>Most of these offences attract penalties including sentences of up to three years in prison.<\/p> <p>The threat to a free press was recently exacerbated by President Farmajo who is seeking his second term re-election. During a public address he made on 26 September 2020, the President linked journalists and media houses critical of his administration to the terror group Al-Shabaab.<\/p> <p>In addition to the generalized ongoing violence against journalists, authorities in Somalia have often invoked alleged national security concerns and the fight against Al-Shabaab as a basis to attack journalists, shut down media houses, restrict the right to freedom of expression and access to information. Therefore, such comments against journalists by the country\u2019s leader in a particularly critical time ahead of the national elections would only amount to an imminent threat to Somalia\u2019s press freedom.<\/p> <p>Details of some of the violations recorded from January 2018 \u2013 September 2020 can be found in our report on The State of Press Freedom in Somalia which will be published on

offices \u2013 Nigerian Police","Input.publish_date":"2019-09-18 16:02:01","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Nigerian police on Wednesday laid a siege to the offices of news platform, Sahara Reporters; and rights group, Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), in Lagos as rights groups condemned the development.<\/p> <p>Fully armed police contingents arrived at about 6 a.m. at the national secretariat of CDHR at Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja and the office of Civic Media Lab at Isaac John, GRA Ikeja where Sahara Reporters is assumed to be domiciled.<\/p> <p>The security operatives were still there at the time of this report.<\/p> <p>They are believed to have gathered at both offices to prevent a protest planned to demand the release of activist Omoyele Sowore from prison.<\/p> <p>However, when PREMIUM TIMES reached out to the spokesperson of the Lagos Police Command, Bala Elkana, he said the deployment of police to the areas was to serve as protection and ensure that law and order were maintained.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey are there to provide security and ensure that there is no breach of peace\u201d, he said curtly.<\/p> <p>When this reporter visited Civic Media Lab location, two police vans with at least 10 fully armed police officers in them were stationed directly opposite the gate.<\/p> <p>Also at the CDHR national secretariat, six police vans with at least 25 fully armed officers were on ground. Four of the vans parked in front of the gate of the building housing the secretariat while two parked directly opposite the building.<\/p> <p>A reporter with SaharaTV told PREMIUM TIMES that the security guards of the property locked down the building when they sighted the police contingent.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe never had any confrontation with the police, we just saw them in front of our gate. What caused this is the protest organised by Coalition for Revolution. Sahara TV had two of the conveners on air and they felt probably the TV will be a staging point for some of those actions,\u201d said the reporter who requested not to be named.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey banged on our gate but nobody came out. They started harassing people in front of our office, passersby who were just going about their duties.<\/p> <p>\u201cNone of our crew members could get in. We have some of our staff members who worked overnight in, they couldn\u2019t get out.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe building\u2019s security men simply used their discretion by locking up totally to avoid indiscriminate arrest of workers when police officers started banging on the gate, commanding people to come out without giving any reason.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey were just shouting that everyone should come out and that they were under arrest, but they didn\u2019t present any warrant to that effect. So the security guards locked up the building and since the police have refused to leave, no one is able to go in or out of the building.<\/p> <p>\u201cAlthough they demanded that people should come out of the building, they never said why that should be the case.\u201d<\/p> <p>The reporter, who said he was just arriving for work and had not accessed the building, said a few workers were able to sneak out when the police left their gate for a few minutes.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey left for some minutes and we were able to evacuate a few workers from the building. They came back and didn\u2019t leave the gate until other media houses started coming and asking what was happening before they stepped back from the gate and went opposite the building.\u201d<\/p> <p>When PREMIUM TIMES reached out to the President of CDHR, Malachy Ugwumadu, he condemned the siege by the police.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe news of the invasion of the national secretariat of CDHR has come to me as a very rude shock. The Nigerian state is gradually slipping into an autocratic mode in which case they must remain very intolerable to any form of organised groupings, including divergent views.<\/p> <p>\u201cBut to now reverse the gains we have made over 30 years ago regarding our fundamental rights to freely assemble and associate is a very sad commentary.<\/p> <p>\u201cI condemn the siege that is presently placed on the national secretariat of CDHR. If there is any reason why they came there at all, that reason must have been a public information. You don\u2019t plan anything untoward and then give a public notice to that effect.<\/p> <p>\u201cTherefore, if Nigerians have agreed to meet at the national secretariat of CDHR that has consistently played the same role even under the military for 30 years, I do not see any justification for this and we are going to find out exactly why our office was condoned off this morning as early as 6am and they are still there. I will put a call across to the commissioner of police as to why such action was taken or necessary.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said there was no justification for condoning off or restricting people from accessing their legitimate place of business.<\/p> <p>Advertisements<\/p> <p>\u201cThe condoning off of the Sahara Reporters building is a bit excessive. Whatever it is that they have by way of their beat as security operatives, it cannot justify the violation of the rights of Nigerians to have free access to their legitimate business area.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cRemember that the national secretariat of CDHR also has other companies and concerns housed in the same building. It is a huge building, so why not invite the leadership of the organisation, why will you seal off the place and make a mockery of yourself?<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople who are issuing notices to have meetings are terrorised, those who are in the bush terrorising the country are now being paid in the form of amnesty. It is a big contradiction. These are vestiges of the state we have long passed where the military is riding roughshod on our rights, we won\u2019t take it.<\/p> <p>\u201cTo what extent will you justify sealing up a business premise? Omoyele Sowore is not Sahara Reporters. Sahara Reporters is a business concern, an entity that is a corporate legal establishment. Sowore might be a director there but he is not Sahara Reporters.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey should give us the reason for their actions because this is reminiscent of the military period. We have never had it this chaotic since that period and I believe it is condemnable and unacceptable and they need to apologise for their actions, otherwise we will all hear from ourselves one way or the other.\u201d<\/p> <p>Speaking on the siege, Olaseni Ajayi, co-covener of Coalition for Revolution (CORE), said the actions confirmed that the rights of Nigerians are no longer guaranteed under this dispensation.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe right to speech, associate, protest and even to think are no more guaranteed under this neo- regime. It is crude and confirms everything we have been saying about this regime and the situation in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>\u201cHowever, our agitation for the immediate release of Omoyele Sowore, Agba Jalingo, Abayomi Olawale (Mandate) and all others currently being held in Buhari detention centres, and for the revolutionary transformation of the country continues.\u201d<\/p> <p>SERAP condemns Siege<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has called on the federal government to lift the siege.<\/p> <p>READ ALSO:<\/p> <p>In a statement released by its deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the group said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s authorities should immediately lift the siege to the offices of Sahara Reporters and Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), end the illegality and allow journalists, activists and civil society to operate freely.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cNigeria\u2019s security agents and state governors should also immediately stop the nationwide campaign of arbitrary arrests against journalists, activists and protesters. The attack on Sahara Reporters and CDHR is coming on the heels of staggering crackdown on critics, journalists and activists by many state governors.\u201d<\/p> <p>The group said the government is increasingly targeting journalists, critics and activists, stating that it is an obvious attempt to silence investigative journalism.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe federal authorities and many state governors are targeting journalists, critics and activists, in clear violation of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution of 1999 (as amended), and international obligations, as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to requiring the authorities to respect fundamental rights and the rules of law.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese attacks are clearly aimed at silencing the kind of journalism and investigative reporting that makes federal and state governments uncomfortable. President Muhammadu Buhari now needs to make clear that he doesn\u2019t want any part of this kind of behaviour and that unacceptable and dangerous threats and attacks against journalists, protesters and activists will be fully investigated.\u201d<\/p> <p>SERAP also called on the international community to intervene in the situation in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe international community including the African Union, the UN human rights special mechanisms and Treaties Bodies, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights as well as Nigeria\u2019s international partners can and should push for an end to the escalating crackdown on journalists, bloggers and activists, and for investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for the intimidation, harassment and attacks.<\/p> <p>\u201cOtherwise, when state security forces arbitrarily arrest and detain brave journalists and protesters like Agba Jalingo, Omoyele Sowore, and Mary Ekere and continue to get away with it, they benefit from a climate of impunity.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThese journalists are prisoners of conscience who must be released immediately and unconditionally.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cWe strongly condemn the arrest of Mary Ekere of The Post, for taking photos of task force officials who raided a city spot, and Agba Jalingo, Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of CrossRiverWatch, following his publication of an article asking Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River to come clean on the whereabouts of the N500 million that was released for the State\u2019s Microfinance bank.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3FCO4VKOZ6S94P2LBM79LV16M2HE7L"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":436,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2019","month":"September","date":null,"city":"Lagos","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mary Ekere","victim_keywords":"The Post, journalist, detained, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Omoyele Sowore","victim_keywords":"activist, journalist, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Agba Jalingo","victim_keywords":"CrossRiverWatch, editor, publisher, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Abayomi Olawale","victim_keywords":"Buhari detention centres, arrested","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, Sahara Reporters, activists, Committee for the Defence of Human Rights","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2019","month":"September","date":null,"city":"Lagos","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mary Ekere","victim_keywords":"The Post, journalist, detained, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Omoyele Sowore","victim_keywords":"activist, journalist, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Agba Jalingo","victim_keywords":"CrossRiverWatch, editor, publisher, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Abayomi Olawale","victim_keywords":"Buhari detention centres, arrested","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, Sahara Reporters, activists, Committee for the Defence of Human Rights","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1037709542,"Input.title":"Andy Vermaut (AIDL -

According to International Commission of Jurists Secretary General Sam Zarifi, censorship, physical assault, and arbitrary arrest are becoming more common in Pakistan. Following \"mysterious and unnamed individuals\" were \"non-state actors or proscribed terrorist organisations\", political parties, religious groups, state officials and intelligence services.

What does it do? TV networks have been questioned about regulators like PEMRA alerting, instructing, and forbidding anchors from commenting on debate shows.

An EU research also acknowledges that criticizing the military or the CPEC is especially forbidden. Pakistan Regulators have stopped cable companies from delivering vital networks.

The Asia Internet Coalition (AlC) voiced concern about Pakistan's attempt at digital\/internet censorship through Citizen Protection Rules (Against Online Harm) in February 2020. Authorities demanded that illicit content be removed within 24 hours or risk a 500 million PKR fine. These restrictions would imperil the AIC's survival in Pakistan.

Lenin, the ultimate Machiavellian \u2014 who used every means, including the secret police and forced labor camps, in the pursuit of power \u2014 would have approved. So would Mao Zedong, the founder of the CCP, who summed up his philosophy succinctly: \u201cPolitical power grows out of the barrel of a gun.\u201d<\/p> <p>Missing from Xi\u2019s list of Communist China\u2019s \u201caccomplishments\u201d was Mao\u2019s so-called Great Leap Forward, his heedless experiment in backyard furnaces and agricultural collectivism that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 50 million Chinese. The massive toll of dead did not matter to Mao, the unrepentant communist ideologue, nor to Xi, who lavishly lauded Mao Zedong Thought.<\/p> <p>Xi also did not mention the Tiananmen Square Massacre of June 1989, when tanks and troops of the People\u2019s Liberation Army killed hundreds and quite possibly thousands of pro-democracy students who had occupied the square to call for more political freedom. To this day, most Chinese are ignorant of what happened in Tiananmen Square.<\/p> <p>Genocide against the Uyghurs<\/p> <p>Absent from Xi\u2019s address was any reference to his government\u2019s calculated persecution of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang province in Western China. Both the Trump and Biden administrations\u2019 secretaries of state accused Communist China of practicing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Uyghurs.<\/p> <p>No more serious charge can be made against a regime than that it is engaged, to quote Webster\u2019s, in \u201cthe deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group.\u201d Genocide conjures up the darkest and most disturbing images of places like Nazi Germany.<\/p> <p>Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in January 2021 that China, under the direction and control of the CCP, continues to commit genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. In his Senate confirmation hearings, then-Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken seconded Pompeo.<\/p> <p>In its annual human rights report, the State Department listed these acts:<\/p> <p>Arbitrary imprisonment in reeducation camps of 1 million Uyghur civilians, (2) forced sterilizations, (3) coerced abortions, (4) rape and torture of those imprisoned, (5) forced labor such as the picking of cotton by hand, (6) \u201cdraconian\u201d restrictions on religious freedom, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement.<\/p> <p>In addition to the mass detention of more than one million Uyghurs, an estimated two million Muslims are subjected to daytime \u2018re-education\u2019 training.<\/p> <p>Chinese Communist authorities justify their genocidal actions by referring to three occasions in 2014 when Uyghur militants bombed a market and train stations, one during Xi\u2019s visit to the region, and killed more than 100 people. In retaliation, Xi launched the \u201cPeople\u2019s War on Terror\u201d in Xinjiang province, where Uyghurs constitute almost 90 percent of the population.<\/p> <p>He delivered a series of hardline speeches, declaring that \u201cWe must be as harsh as them and show absolutely no mercy.\u201d He called on the Communist Party to unleash the tools of \u201cdictatorship\u201d to eradicate radical Islam in Xinjiang.<\/p> <p>Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party boss in Xinjiang, got the message. Chen instructed police officers and troops to prepare for a \u201csmashing, obliterating offensive\u201d and issued an open-ended directive: \u201cRound up everyone who should be rounded up.\u201d<\/p> <p>Eradicating the Uyghurs\u2019 Religion and Culture<\/p> <p>Since then, the government, under the direction of the CCP, has carried out a deliberate policy of eradication of the Uyghurs\u2019 Muslim religion and culture. Han Chinese cadres are placed in Uyghur homes as monitors. Uyghurs who engage in \u201cextremist\u201d behavior such as praying, owning religious books, or abstaining from alcohol or tobacco are placed in \u201cre-education camps.\u201d<\/p> <p>Uyghurs in rural areas are required to obtain special cards for travel between towns. Traditional festivals and pilgrimage sites have been closed. Private education in Uyghur language and religion has been criminalized. Police have raided homes in search of forbidden books. Children\u2019s names such as Fatima and Muhammad are banned as too Islamic. More than 100 Uyghur cemeteries have been destroyed. Biometric data is collected of all Xinjiang residents between 12 and 65 years of age.<\/p> <p>Selected Uyghur prisoners are placed in the liuzhi detention system, which operates outside the normal judicial system and is used by the government and the CCP to investigate what they call corruption. Treatment includes prolonged solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, beatings, forced standing or sitting for hours and sometimes days, and sexual harassment.<\/p> <p>The evidence of deliberate genocide is so compelling that even left-wing journals like The New Republic have condemned Communist China\u2019s treatment of the Uyghurs. The journal described the 2 million Uyghurs forced into scattered \u201cgulags\u201d across the region as \u201cthe largest imprisonment \u2014 based not on crimes, but on ethnicity and religion alone \u2014 since the Holocaust.\u201d<\/p> <p>The magazine estimated that Xinjiang has a higher percentage of police density than East Germany, which had more police informants per capita than Nazi Germany. Nowhere in the world, wrote the German weekly Der Spiegel, \u201cis the population monitored as strictly as it is in\u201d Xinjiang.<\/p> <p>Political Prisoners<\/p> <p>In addition to its genocide against the Uyghurs, the PRC routinely violates the human rights of the 1.4 billion Chinese who are not Muslim.<\/p> <p>Dozens of pro-democracy protestors and activists, such as famed publisher Jimmy Lai, have been routinely arrested and jailed. Hundreds of human rights lawyers have been put in jail; many have been arrested and are still unaccounted for. In 2017, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who long spoke forcefully on behalf of freedom and democracy, died in a hospital while under close surveillance by the CCP.<\/p> <p>Thousands of political prisoners, including writers, scholars, activists, pastors, Falun Gong practitioners, Catholic priests, rights lawyers, and bloggers, remain incarcerated. Numerous former political prisoners have reported they were beaten, raped, subjected to electric shock, hung by the wrists, forced to take medication against their will, and subjected to physical and psychological abuse.<\/p> <p>The Ministry of Public Security directly administers 23 psychiatric hospitals for the criminally insane. There have been reports of political activists being subjected to psychiatric treatment.<\/p> <p>Qelbinur Sedik, a former teacher at a women\u2019s internment camp, reported that some 10,000 women had their heads shaved and were forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions. Women were raped and sexually abused daily by camp guards. A torture room in the camp basement was reserved for those who resisted.<\/p> <p>There is no freedom of expression in Communist China. For example, students taking online classes at American universities were imprisoned for criticizing the government, as were university professors critical of Beijing.<\/p> <p>Just how important is control of this freedom was underscored by Xi Jinping\u2019s personal involvement. Xi has visited Chinese media outlets and demanded they pledge their loyalty to him. When blogger Ren Zhiqiang, who had 35 million followers, criticized Xi\u2019s editorial demands, he was shut down.<\/p> <p>Surveillance and the Social Credit System<\/p> <p>Advances in surveillance technology, including artificial intelligence and intrusive surveillance aps, along with police access to user data, have helped facilitate Communist China\u2019s prosecution of dissident leaders, according to Freedom House. The Ministry of Public Security uses tens of millions of surveillance cameras to monitor public events and identify individuals in crowds. The government even installed surveillance cameras in monasteries in the Tibetan Autonomous Region.<\/p> <p>The Chinese government continues to use two kinds of social credit systems. The corporate social credit system tracks corporate wrongdoing. The personal social credit system collects information from a wide variety of sources, including academic records, traffic violations, social media presence, friendships, acceptance of birth-control regulations, employment performance, and consumption habits.<\/p> <p>Destroying Religion<\/p> <p>Freedom of religion is another major concern of the Chinese Communist Party. Xi has expressed a desire to \u201cSinicize\u201d all religions. Accordingly, crosses have been removed from churches, the Bible is being retranslated to find commonalities with Socialism, the Ten Commandments have been replaced with quotes from Xi Jinping, Christian churches have been burned down, and the CCP was caught spying on the Vatican\u2019s computer networks.<\/p> <p>Promoting \u201cChinese Christianity\u201d is the end goal. The Ten Commandments have been replaced with quotes from Xi.<\/p> <p>Communist China continues to take all necessary steps to suppress any sign of true Tibetan autonomy and culture, announcing, for example, that it plans to choose the Dalai Lama\u2019s successor. Two million Tibetans have been forcibly \u201crehoused\u201d to \u201cNew Socialist Villages.\u201d Thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns have been expelled from their monasteries, and Buddhist customs such as meditation have been criminalized. More than 2,000 CCP officials have been sent to Tibetan villages to monitor their behavior.<\/p> <p>The primary instrument of the government\u2019s campaign to suppress human rights is the Communist Party. In his address commemorating the 100th anniversary of the CCP, Xi said that any attempt to separate the party from the Chinese people, or to set the people against the party, \u201cis bound to fail.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said the more than 95 million party members and the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people \u201cwill never allow such a scenario to come to pass.\u201d The ideology that unites the party and the people, he said, is Marxism. \u201cMarxism \u2026 is the very soul of our Party and the banner under which it strives.\u201d<\/p> <p>How the West Must Respond<\/p> <p>What, then, should be the response of the United States and its Western allies to Communist China\u2019s flagrant violation of the most basic human rights of its people? Below are recommendations in a paper by my Heritage colleagues Dean Cheng, Walter Lohman, James Carafano, and Riley Walters.<\/p> <p>The United States should organize and host a summit for democracy and countries commit to defending against authoritarianism and advancing human rights at home and abroad. It should also create a Ministerial on Religious Freedom, modeled after the ministerial pioneered by former Ambassador Sam Brownback, to advance religious freedom in China and around the globe.<\/p> <p>The United States should apply sanctions to those who have violated U.S. intellectual property rights by cyber means.<\/p> <p>The United States should forge closer relationships with Taiwan and India. It should negotiate Free Trade Agreements with Taiwan, Japan, and other key partners in the Indo-Pacific.<\/p> <p>In addition, the United States should apply sanctions to those who have violated U.S. intellectual property rights by cyber means.<\/p> <p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media should strengthen its messaging in countering Beijing\u2019s public opinion warfare.<\/p> <p>Finally, the United States should request the International Olympic Committee to review Communist China\u2019s suitability to host the 2022 Olympics. Given the deadly plight of the Uyghurs, now is not the time for the international community to kowtow to those who would benefit the most from hosting the Olympics: Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party.<\/p> <p>Lee Edwards is the distinguished fellow in conservative thought at the B.

There are lessons to be learned from the Kremlin\u2019s nearly decade-long failure trying to combat the mujahideen in Afghanistan. Given Russia\u2019s incompetent but brutal war in Ukraine, now being directed primarily at hapless civilians, plus an already collapsing economy caused by international sanctions, it could also mean the end of Putin\u2019s ambitions for a new empire.<\/p> <p>When the Soviet 40th Army invaded Afghanistan on 27 December 1979, the Kremlin was \u201cresponding\u201d to a call for assistance by its new Afghan puppet, Babrak Karmal, who had been conveniently flown in from Czechoslovak exile only hours before. While Soviet military advisors had been on the ground ever since the communist April, 1978 \u2018Saur\u2019 revolution, the objective was to make it seem that Moscow had been invited in.<\/p> <p>The Russians specifically wished to get rid of Hafizullah Amin, the increasingly uncontrollable head of the country\u2019s ruling Khalqi faction, but they also wanted to take charge of the regime\u2019s failing efforts to put down rapidly spreading armed revolt.<\/p> <p>Not unlike Hitler\u2019s staged attack on August 31, 1939 by Germans dressed as Polish soldiers against the German transmitter at Gleiwitz to justify his Blitzkrieg, Moscow felt obliged to justify its takeover of Afghanistan, whose Islamist influences, it feared, threatened to undermine its own Central Asian Republics. By quickly occupying Afghanistan, the Russians believed, they could contain the problem. Little did they imagine that their failure to subdue this mountainous and desert country would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union, a factor that appears to have influenced President Vladimir Putin\u2019s current reasoning for re-asserting Russia\u2019s position in the world.<\/p> <p>Putin, who was already in charge in 1999, used similar language to justify his brutal military invasion of Chechnya to prevent the majority Muslim region from breaking away. His war resulted in the razing of Grozny, the Chechen capital. The Russian dictator has replicated similar justifications for his February 24 assault against Ukraine. Describing its population as \u2018vassals\u2019 and \u2018neo-Nazis\u2019 manipulated by NATO and the European Union, the Russian dictator not only perceives democratic Ukraine as a \u201csecurity risk\u201d, but a threat to his own ambitions for a new Russian empire. (See William Dowell article on Ukraine as Russia\u2019s Vietnam)<\/p> <p>Russia\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan failed in the long run<\/p> <p>So how does Afghanistan fit into all this? While many of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, notably the deliberate bombing of towns and fleeing civilians, reek of Chechnya-revisited, there are some lessons worth exploring.<\/p> <p>Not unlike Moscow\u2019s 41st Army push with an estimated 150,000 troops deployed from Russia and Belorussia in the north, but also annexed Crimea and the Black Sea in the south, the Red Army invaded Afghanistan with a 115,000-strong force. While the bulk of its troops crossed over from bordering Soviet Central Asia, airborne units within days took major airfields, such as Bagram, Kandahar and Shindand. As this writer can ascertain based on first-hand reporting, the Kremlin figured that such military might alone would suffice to intimidate the country\u2019s largely illiterate population and poorly armed rebels.<\/p> <p>The shock and awe invasion initially worked. Resistance was light and over five million Afghans fled the country, many of them during the first few months. Supported by Afghan government forces, including paid and often ruthless communist militia, the Red Army quickly established its control in the cities. Throughout Russia\u2019s nearly decade-long control, Kabul suffered only limited damage. Only a few specialized guerrilla fronts focused on urban assaults and assassinations.<\/p> <p>It was a different story in the countryside, where the mujahideen, or holy warriors as Afghan guerrillas were known, took their war. Operating from amongst the high mountains and rugged deserts, they fought an increasingly successful campaign of attrition by ambushing Red Army convoys and attacking forward bases. Outside military assistance in the form of weapons and funds provided by the CIA, Saudis, Pakistanis and others steadily strengthened their ability to fight, particularly with the arrival of US-supplied Stinger missiles \u2013 a gamechanger for the Afghan resistance \u2013 which forced Soviet MIGs and helicopter gunships to fly high and less effectively.<\/p> <p>The mujahideen basically made it impossible for the Soviets to assert themselves despite repeated major land and air offensives involving 12,000 troops or more against guerrilla strongholds. Frustrated, the Soviets destroyed over 22,000 villages forcing out civilians and turning farms into parched moonscapes by rupturing irrigation canals and killing off fruit orchards as a means of denying the resistance local support. They also laced the mountain passes, roads and farmlands with anti-personnel and other mines inflicting a devastating problem that has taken years to clear.<\/p> <p>Russian propaganda also perpetuated the myth of \u201cbrotherly friendship\u201d between the Soviet and Afghan peoples. While the East-bloc trained KHAD, the Afghan version of the KGB, stifled urban opposition, including demonstrations, through arrests, beatings and summary executions, Moscow sought to ensure the appearance of stability and progress \u2013 at least in the cities. It did this by subsidizing wheat and other food prices to the detriment of the Soviet economy. It also inaugurated \u2018modern\u2019 or refurbished apartment blocks, factories and hospitals, sometimes several times for television and PR purposes. As Red Army soldiers found to their astonishment, you could eat better in Kabul than back in the USSR.<\/p> <p>Russian president Vladimir Putin, according to human rights organizations, already a dictator and war criminal in the making.<\/p> <p>Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine: a poorly planned operation now resorting to killing civilians<\/p> <p>Similar developments have emerged in Ukraine. Nearly three million Ukrainians \u2013 mainly women, children and the elderly \u2013 have already fled as the Russians increasingly \u2013 and deliberately \u2013 bomb populated areas. \u201cIt\u2019s like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d recalled a former International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegate who was in Peshawar, Pakistan, when the first waves of Afghan refugees crossed the border. The Russians are also preventing humanitarian supplies from reaching besieged populations.<\/p> <p>While Afghanistan had a functioning communist regime largely willing to accept Russian backing, it seems unlikely that many Ukrainians except perhaps well-rewarded Quislings will collaborate openly with the invaders. Moscow-inserted officials in the now Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, for example, which is witnessing daily anti-Moscow demonstrations, have been seeking to interact with the local population only to find themselves ostracized. Even ethnic Russian-Ukranians have been criticizing the Putin regime. The invading Russians are now resorting to kidnapping or otherwise eliminating mayors and other municipal officials in captured towns and villages.<\/p> <p>According to the Melitopol\u2019s Ukrainian mayor, Ivan Federov, the Russians have been staging fake humanitarian food distributions for propaganda purposes using actors to portray concerned aid workers, but nothing is actually handed out. \u201cWe are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThey have not tried to help us\u2026and we do not want their help.\u201d<\/p> <p>Unlike the Afghans, whether the mujahideen fighting the Soviets or the Taliban against NATO, the Ukrainians have a different and less advantageous terrain to operate in. Their war will be fought more in and around the towns with bitter street and trench fighting using shelled buildings for cover not unlike, ironically, the manner with which the Germans and Soviets fought in Stalingrad. \u201cRussia\u2019s invasion has been incredibly badly organized and is now running into real trouble,\u201d noted a senior NATO officer. \u201cTheir desperation has become clear by their efforts now to make the lives of civilians hell.\u201d<\/p> <p>The independent Russian radio station Echo was recently shut down by the Kremlin and its FM wavelengths handed over to the government-run Sputnik network. Banning words such as \u2018war\u2019 and \u2018invasion\u2019, the Kremlin\u2019s repression of independent Russian and foreign press is forcing many to rely on official information sources, such as state television, which fail to provide the real picture of what is happening in Ukraine. (Photo: Wikipedia)<\/p> <p>Kremlin disinformation: preventing the truth from reaching Russians<\/p> <p>At the same time, while costly, Ukraine\u2019s war against the invaders has already proven highly effective, something that the Kremlin was not expecting. Russian forces have only been able to advance slowly against significant resistance, which has been blocking road access for fuel supplies given the number of destroyed tankers and trucks. For this reason, the Russians will probably persist with their air and long-range artillery assaults resulting in the steady destruction of Ukraine\u2019s towns leaving a massively devastated land in their wake.<\/p> <p>The Ukrainians, who already have been receiving western military assistance in the form of anti-aircraft missiles, including Stingers, and anti-tank weapons, have been taking a toll on Russian planes and helicopters. (The mujahideen, in contrast, had to wait several years for such weaponry). According to the Royal United Services Institute in London, at least 20 Russian aircraft have been visually confirmed as shot down, an indication that the Russians are struggling for air supremacy. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, which has admitted to suffering its own aircraft losses, claims it has downed nearly 60 Russian aircraft plus more than 80 helicopters.<\/p> <p>Russia\u2019s deliberate targeting of the city of Mariupol has already inflicted thousands of casualties and is preventing the arrival of humanitarian supplies. (Photo: ICRC)<\/p> <p>While such claims cannot be verified, the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP) has noted that if western intelligence is to be believed, the Russians are suffering considerable casualties, \u201cpossibly in their thousands, including at least two generals.\u201d The Pentagon is putting the figure at between 5,000-6,000, while the Ukrainians claim more than 12,000.<\/p> <p>The Kremlin, however, is not making the mistake as in Afghanistan by sending back dead soldiers in caskets and leaving it up to Soviet mothers to spread the word. This proved a crucial factor for building popular resentment to the war during the 1980s. As one BBC journalist noted, the Russians are also leaving their dead behind without bothering to remove them. Ukranians have been removing their weapons, videoing their remains and collecting their IDs to eventually inform Russians back home as to what is happening to their boys.<\/p> <p>With this conflict, however, Putin\u2019s troops are operating mobile incinerators. The last thing the Kremlin wants is to have closed coffins lined up on airport tarmacs appearing in social media. It is also keeping the official number of deaths low, 500 or so to date, and declaring them \u2018heroes\u2019, precisely what Moscow did throughout the Soviet-Afghan war.<\/p> <p>Unlike Afghanistan, where the bulk of Red Army soldiers were poorly trained conscripts, Russia\u2019s Ukrainian war is relying more on so-called \u2018contractors\u2019, soldiers who have signed up for longer than the one-year draft in return for better pay. Many, too, are Chechen mercenaries. Last week, the Kremlin announced that it was engaging Syrian \u2018volunteers\u2019 to help with its war.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, as recently captured Russian POWs have indicated in video testimony, many are still conscripts, while contractors are pointing out that their pay is too paltry to make joining the army attractive. Morale appears low. As occurred in Afghanistan, Russian soldiers, who have access only to official information sources, are saying that they did not know they would be invading Ukraine but had been told they would be on maneuvers in Belorussia.<\/p> <p>Afghanistan resulted in the collapse of the USSR. Is Ukraine the end of Putin\u2019s expansionism?<\/p> <p>As during the Soviet-Afghan war, the Kremlin has sought to control credible information. Given Putin\u2019s repressive crackdown of social media and outside news sources, such as the now banned BBC, but also its repression of Russia\u2019s own remaining outspoken press where the words \u2018war\u2019 and \u2018invasion\u2019 are banned, Ukrainian cyberhackers encouraged by the Kyiv government are ensuring that harsh realities from the front constantly interrupt official state media. As one source with the Cyber Security Forum in Geneva maintained, \u201cthe ultimate success of Ukrainian resistance may lie in its ability to completely hack the Russian system.\u201d Many Russians still have little idea about the realities of the Kremlin\u2019s ruthless war in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Initially, the Soviets in Afghanistan at least had the benefit of an Afghan army to work with. But as the occupation became more futile, thousands of Afghans deserted. Even senior Afghan officers within the high command collaborated with the resistance. The only ones the Russians could rely on were the paid militia, but even these readily changed sides the moment funds ran out. Red Army troops, too, soon realized how pointless the war was resulting in high alcoholism, drug addiction and depression. Not only that, but the war was proving financially draining, something that international sanctions against Putin\u2019s Russia and inner circles may be achieving.<\/p> <p>The whole purpose now of an effective resistance strategy by the Ukranians is to ensure that occupation simply becomes too costly \u2013 and pointless \u2013 to continue. The Soviet Union lost up to 25,000 dead during the Afghan war. Russia could face similar casualties in Ukraine. They will have achieved nothing, except, perhaps the demise of both Putin and his dream of a new, expansionist Russia.<\/p> <p>Edward Girardet is a foreign correspondent, author and editor of the Geneva-based Global Insights Magazine.

I had heard the same kinds of accounts from other victims of torture in detention, including the same names of two lieutenants and a major who he said had supervised and participated in torturing him and others.<\/p> <p>I had sent those same names to Faik Zaidan, the head of the Iraqi High Judicial Council in April 2019, after earlier victims shared them with me, asking the council to investigate their actions. In fact, at Human Rights Watch, we have reported on torture in Iraq for decades, but it continues. It is clearly futile to keep calling on the Iraqi government to address the systemic use of torture and inhuman prison conditions on its own. Outside help is needed. Iraq\u2019s Parliament should ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. This would allow an independent United Nations team to visit prisons in Iraq and advise and assist Iraq in strengthening protections against torture. And short of parliamentary action, the new prime minister can act to uphold the dignity of his fellow citizens and reverse the country\u2019s shameful record on torture in detention.<\/p> <p>The young man who contacted us recently, now 22, told my colleague that as a boy of 17, he smuggled himself out of the city of Mosul in early 2015 after the Islamic State (ISIS) took control. He made his way to Iran for surgery he had needed for years. He returned to Mosul in May 2017, after Iraqi forces, with U.S. military support, retook the city.<\/p> <p>But Iraqi soldiers arrested him in April 2018 without a warrant, he said, put guns to his head, and ordered him to confess that he had been an ISIS member. When he refused, they beat him with a leather truncheon, shocked him with electricity, and hung him repeatedly from his hands bound behind his back and suspended from the ceiling on and off for five days. When he did not give in, they threatened to rape his mother and sister in front of him, he said.<\/p> <p>On the fifth day, they brought him a piece of paper, saying he needed to sign it, while blindfolded, so they could transfer him to the hospital. \u201cI later found out they had tricked me into signing a statement that I had joined ISIS for 20 days,\u201d he said. At the hospital, the officers forced the doctor to sign a document that he had not been tortured, though he says he had visible bruising, including on his face. They took him before an investigative judge, who ignored his bruises and told him a \u201csecret informant\u201d had accused him of manning an ISIS checkpoint on a Mosul road in 2015. He showed the judge the Iranian stamp in his passport -- proof he hadn\u2019t been in Mosul at the time.<\/p> <p>Ten weeks after his arrest, police transferred him to the Intelligence and Counter Terrorism Office and prison compound in Faisaliya, in east Mosul, infamous as a torture site. He said he was held there for a year in a cell with at least 250 other men and boys. There was only one toilet, and he was only able to shower once every two months. He wasn\u2019t allowed to contact his family. During that time, they hung him from the ceiling several more times, he said.<\/p> <p>In mid-2018, officers transferred him to a damaged home being used as a detention center in the town of Qayyarah, 60 kilometers south of Mosul, for five days, to a cell with at least 50 other men and boys. He said that every day the guards would bring the detainees rice and soup, dump both on the floor, and make them eat off the floor. Once, he said, guards took the detainees out in the rain and forced them to crawl on the ground in the mud.<\/p> <p>In December 2018, he said, officers transferred him to Tal Kayf prison, 10 kilometers north of Mosul, to a cell holding around 250 men and boys: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough room for all of us in the cell to lie down at the same time, so we had to take turns sleeping.\u201d He said prison guards watched as two former security officers being held on criminal charges regularly beat other detainees.<\/p> <p>In June 2019, he said, the authorities transferred the adults out of Tal Kayf prison, leaving only the detainees who, like him, were children at the time of their alleged crimes. He said this reduced the crowding but that SWAT forces -- Special Weapons and Tactics, under the Interior Ministry\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Service -- came to his cell at least six times and beat him and his cellmates.<\/p> <p>The Nineveh juvenile court in August 2019 convicted him and sentenced him to six years for ISIS affiliation. On Feb. 3, 2020, the federal appeals court acquitted and released him because of the evidence that he presented -- the Iranian passport stamp and medical records of his eye surgery. We reviewed the court records and spoke to a court employee who confirmed his account to us.<\/p> <p>The Iraqi Parliament has been unwilling to pass an anti-torture bill for years, even though Iraq\u2019s constitution prohibits torture. The bill would require a judge to order a medical examination of any detainee alleging torture within 24 hours of learning of the allegation, which is often not occurring. But maybe the parliament is more willing to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture that brings with it outside expertise and support to tackle this widespread wrong. But that should not prevent the government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi from taking action.<\/p> <p>The many governments that have been supporting Iraq for years in its fight against ISIS, including the US, UK and France, should bring funding and expertise to Baghdad to engage actively in helping the government at this critical juncture to set up a national unit to prevent torture -- a key pillar of the torture treaty\u2019s optional protocol. The unit should have the authority to inspect all detention centers in Iraq, and to create an effective system to bring complaints about mistreatment in Iraqi detention. The day the government does this, I will have a wealth of information to share.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3D5G8J4N5CJD4YLEJFZKQVHABUBVTK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"cfe772f1-9e88-4332-850f-791cd09c3fd2","work_time_in_seconds":827,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2018","month":"04","date":null,"city":"Mosul","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"young man, beat, shocked, hung by hands, threatened, tricked into signing confession, imprisoned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2018","month":"04","date":null,"city":"Mosul","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"young man, beat, shocked, hung by hands, threatened, tricked into signing confession, imprisoned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":933852005,"Input.title":"Ineos sparks fury in UK with possible 4x4 relocation to France","Input.publish_date":"2020-07-08 02:20:47","Input.article_interface":"<p>Ineos Automotive is now rethinking its plan to build the Grenadier car in Wales, after entering into talks to acquire a plant from Daimler in France<\/p> <p>LONDON, United Kingdom \u2013 The Ineos group of Brexit-supporting British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe said on Tuesday, July 7, it was in talks to build a new 4\u00d74 vehicle at a Daimler plant in France, shelving a planned investment in Wales and provoking cries of betrayal.<\/p> <p>Ineos Automotive had said it was looking to build the Grenadier car \u2013 billed as a successor to the iconic Land Rover Defender \u2013 partly in Portugal and assemble it in Wales, but was now rethinking that plan because of the coronavirus outbreak.<\/p> <p>The company, part of Ratcliffe\u2019s Ineos chemicals group, said the global pandemic had \u201cled to some delays in our development plans, but has also presented some new opportunities in terms of existing manufacturing capacity that were not previously available to us.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cSpecifically, Ineos Automotive has entered detailed discussions with [Daimler\u2019s] Mercedes-Benz on the acquisition of its Hambach site in Moselle, France,\u201d a statement read.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have therefore suspended the post-lockdown resumption of work at our sites in Wales and Portugal pending the outcome of this review.

But our demands were ignored. Even the speech of the minister concerned while he was placing the bill in parliament and the opinion of the media representatives placed before the standing committee was not taken into consideration,\" said the statement.<\/p> <p>The representative of the media pinpointed the questionable sections of the law and recommended their amendment. Had those recommendations were taken into consideration, today's situation might not have arisen, it said.<\/p> <p>The Editors' Council on September 29, 2018, had given a detail explanation as to why it was concerned over the act.<\/p> <p>In the explanation, the Editors' Council expressed concern over 9 sections (8, 21, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 43 and 53) of the act.<\/p> <p>In trying to make a law prevent crimes through digital devices and provide security in the digital sphere, the act ends up policing media operations and controlling the media contents. Sections 8, 21, 25, 28, 29, 31 and 32 are contradictory to freedom of the press, guaranteed by the constitution, it said.<\/p> <p>These sections will create a scope for controlling people's freedom of speech and expression. For example, section-8 says the law enforcers can request the BTRC to remove information or block it if it deems any information that are published or circulated in digital media undermining unity of the country or part of it, economic activities, security, defence, religious sentiments, or public rules and order, or creates hatred, hostility towards any ethnicity.<\/p> <p>Section-21 says that if any person, through digital media, spreads propaganda or assist it against Liberation War, Spirit of the Liberation War, Father of the Nation, National Anthem, and National Flag, such action will be considered a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-25 says if any person using a website or any digital device deliberately or knowingly spreads any information or data that is attacking or intimidating in nature; or if a person publishes or distributes any information, despite knowing that it is false, to irritate, humiliate, defame or embarrass or to discredit a person, or damages the image and reputation of the state or spreads confusion or with the same purpose publishes or distributes fully or partially distorted information or data despite knowing that it is false, and if any one assists in such actions, then all such actions of the individual will be considered a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-28 states that if a person or group with the intention of hurting or inciting religious values or sentiments intentionally or knowingly publishes or promotes something on a website or in any other electronic format, which hurts religious feelings or religious values, then this act of that person will be a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-31 states that if a person intentionally publishes or broadcasts something on a website or digital format that causes hostility, hatred or animosity between the various classes or communities concerned or destroys communal harmony or causes instability or disorder or deterioration of law and order or if it happens or is about to happen, then it will be a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-32 states that if a person commits or assists in committing any crime under the Official Secrets Act through computer, digital device, computer network, digital network or any other digital means, the person will then be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or a fine not exceeding Tk 25 lakh or both.<\/p> <p>The statement also said the DSA will create an atmosphere of panic and intimidation where journalism, especially investigative journalism, will become virtually impossible.<\/p> <p>This law will create fear among all the users, including media workers, who uses computers and computer networks.<\/p> <p>Section-43 of the act gives the police unlimited powers in terms of entering homes to search them, search offices, search people's bodies and seize everything related to computers, computer networks, servers and digital platforms. The police will be able to arrest any person without a warrant under the powers given by the law. In this case, there is no need to get any kind of approval from any police authorities.<\/p> <p>The statement adds that there is ambiguity in this law and many words have been used which can be misinterpreted and easily used against the media.<\/p> <p>Another concern of the Sampadak Parishad is that out of about 20 sections of the law relating to crime and punishment, 14 are non-bailable, five are bailable and one is negotiable.

The crackdown appears connected to an event, \u201cIngabire Day,\u201d organized by the unregistered opposition party Dalfa-Umurinzi, that had been scheduled for October 14, 2021, to discuss among other things political repression in Rwanda.<\/p> <p>Th\u00e9oneste Nsengimana, a journalist who had intended to cover the event and host a discussion on his YouTube channel with Victoire Ingabire, the party\u2019s leader, was arrested on October 13.<\/p> <p>Several party members and regional representatives \u2013 Sylvain Sibomana, Alexis Rucubanganya, Hamad Hagengimana, and Jean-Claude Ndayishimiye \u2013 were also arrested at their homes on October 13, as was Joyeuse Uwatuje, Ingabire\u2019s close friend and personal assistant.<\/p> <p>According to sources within the Dalfa-Umurinzi party, Alphonse Mutabazi was arrested on the morning of October 14, and Marcel Nahimana, the party\u2019s secretary-general, and Emmanuel Masengesho were arrested the evening of October 14. R\u00e9gine Kadoyimana, an administrative assistant in the party, was arrested on October 16 at her home in the capital, Kigali.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Rwandan government\u2019s latest crackdown underscores that it is unwilling to tolerate debate and criticism,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThese blatantly arbitrary and politically motivated arrests are intended to further discourage people from speaking out against government policy or abuse.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) announced in a tweet late on October 13 that Nsengimana and five other unnamed people had been placed under arrest for \u201cpublication of rumours intended to cause uprising or unrest among the population.\u201d It also tweeted a warning against those who use social media to \u201cundermine national security\u201d and \u201cincite divisions.\u201d The agency has not made any public announcements about the four other arrests.<\/p> <p>According to sources within the Dalfa-Umurinzi party, the ten were arrested in different parts of the country, but all except Kadoyimana, the last one arrested, are now being held at Remera police station in Kigali. Kadoyimana is reportedly detained at Kicukiro police station, but Human Rights Watch was not able to independently confirm this. The RIB spokesperson did not respond to Human Rights Watch\u2019s requests for information. All have been given access to a lawyer. On October 18, a RIB agent called Ingabire to summon her to the investigation bureau\u2019s headquarters in Kigali, but at time of publication she had not yet been.<\/p> <p>Rwandan law includes overly broad and vague provisions that enable arbitrary limitations on free speech and that violate the right to freedom of expression and media freedom protections under international law. One of the laws being used to curb free speech is the Law on the Prevention of Cybercrimes, which prohibits the publication of \u201crumours,\u201d punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to three million Rwandan Francs (US$3,000).<\/p> <p>However, whether information is factual does not in itself constitute legitimate grounds to criminalize speech under international law. These charges are wholly inappropriate and underline how the justice system is being used as a tool to stifle dissent and intimidate the public, Human Rights Watch said. All ten people arrested should be immediately and unconditionally released.<\/p> <p>Ingabire, the former president of the unregistered opposition party FDU-Inkingi before creating Dalfa-Umurinzi in November 2019, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiracy to undermine the established government and denying the genocide after she tried to contest the 2010 presidential elections. She was eventually pardoned and released in September 2018.<\/p> <p>Sibomana, the FDU-Inkingi\u2019s then-secretary-general, was first arrested alongside another member of the party, Anselme Mutuyimana, in 2012 and accused of holding an illegal meeting in a bar. Mutuyimana was released in 2018 but found dead in mysterious circumstances in March 2019. Sibomana was released in 2021.<\/p> <p>Nsengimana was previously arrested in April 2020, alongside three other bloggers and a driver, all working with Rwandan YouTube channels that reported on the impact of the Covid-19 guidelines on vulnerable populations. Charges were brought against Nsengimana, Dieudonn\u00e9 Niyonsenga, known as \u201cCyuma Hassan,\u201d the owner of Ishema TV, and his driver, Fid\u00e8le Komezusenge.<\/p> <p>Nsengimana was held in pretrial detention on accusations of fraud but released in May 2020 for lack of evidence. Niyonsenga and Komezusenge were accused of forgery, impersonating journalists, and hindering public works but both were acquitted on March 12, 2021. The prosecution appealed the acquittal, and the hearing is expected in November.<\/p> <p>On October 14, the Rwanda Media Commission issued a statement claiming that Niyonsenga is not a journalist. Rwanda\u2019s narrow definition of journalists as \u201ca person who possesses basic journalism skills and who exercises journalism as his\/her first profession\u201d runs counter to international standards and has allowed the government to prosecute bloggers doing important public interest reporting, Human Rights Watch said.<\/p> <p>In March, Human Rights Watch documented the growing crackdown on people using YouTube to report on human rights abuses and current affairs and to hold political discussions. Between March 2020 and March 2021, at least eight people reporting or commenting on current affairs were threatened, arrested, prosecuted, or \u201cdisappeared\u201d in mysterious circumstances.<\/p> <p>Online commentators, such as Yvonne Idamange and Aimable Karasira, have also used their videos to discuss the 1994 genocide, the crimes committed by the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its aftermath, and the government\u2019s commemorations of the killings.<\/p> <p>Idamange, a Tutsi genocide survivor who accused the government of monetizing the genocide and called for a protest, was found guilty, in a trial held behind closed doors, of inciting violence and public uprising, denigrating genocide artifacts, spreading rumors, and violent assault, among other charges on September 30. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison. On May 31, Karasira was arrested on charges including denying and justifying the genocide and instigating divisions, and has not yet been tried.<\/p> <p>In recent years, several members of the FDU-Inkingi \u2013 now Dalfa-Umurinzi \u2013 have reported being detained incommunicado, beaten, and questioned about their membership to the party. In January 2020, six members were convicted of charges including forming or collaborating with irregular armed forces and offenses against the state. Those convicted included Boniface Twagirimana, the party\u2019s deputy leader, who \u201cdisappeared\u201d from his prison cell in Mpanga, southern Rwanda, in October 2018, and is still missing.<\/p> <p>Three others \u2013 Th\u00e9ophile Ntirutwa, Venant Abayisenga, and L\u00e9onille Gasengayire \u2013 were acquitted of all charges and released. After their release, they gave video interviews to local YouTube channels detailing their pretrial detention and describing ill-treatment and torture, including in Kwa Gacinya, an unofficial detention facility in the Gikondo neighborhood of Kigali, and in Mageragere and Nyanza prisons.<\/p> <p>Abayisenga was reported missing in June 2020 after he went out to buy phone credit, and is feared forcibly disappeared or dead. Ntirutwa was rearrested following an attack at his shop in Rwamagana District on May 11. On May 18, Ntirutwa and three others at his shop at the time of the attack were charged with offenses including murder, theft, and \u201cspreading false information with intent to create a hostile international opinion against the Rwandan State.\u201d Their trial has yet to begin.<\/p> <p>In 2019, three members of the FDU-Inkingi were reported missing or found dead in mysterious circumstances. In addition to Mutuyimana, in September, Syldio Dusabumuremyi, the party\u2019s national coordinator, was stabbed to death. And Eug\u00e8ne Ndereyimana, a party member, was reported missing on July 15, after he failed to arrive for a meeting in Nyagatare, Eastern Province. In March 2016, Illumin\u00e9e Iragena, a political activist and FDU-Inkingi member, was reported missing, most likely forcibly disappeared in unacknowledged government detention.<\/p> <p>\u201cRwanda\u2019s brutal methods to quash dissent give reason to be greatly concerned for the safety and well-being of anyone arrested,\u201d Mudge said. \u201cRwanda\u2019s international partners should publicly condemn the crackdown and Rwanda\u2019s abysmal human rights record, and press for the group\u2019s immediate and unconditional release.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"33EEIIWHK9M0CITM2B5PLQ6NRNCVQ6"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":653,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state

If you\u2019ve got your head around this EV malarkey you\u2019ll know a 24kWh battery doesn\u2019t give you a huge range. The official figure for the car is 115 miles.

With the PICG deducted, our Action trim level 500 with no options costs \u00a322,335. The next most affordable EVs are MG\u2019s ZS crossover and MG5 estate, and Renault\u2019s Zoe. All of those are around 27 grand but do have significantly longer ranges. You can also buy a Fiat 500 with a 42kWh battery that will give a range of just under 200 miles but that car is similar money to the Zoe and MG models.<\/p> <p>The electric Fiat 500 is not related to the regular petrol 500 that\u2019s been on our streets since 2007 (we owned two of them, first a hatchback and second a convertible). For starters it is 60mm longer and the same measurement in extra width.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s still a diddy car, though. A bit more spacious in the back than the petrol models but still better suited to kids than adults.<\/p> <p>Size matters, or lack of it does. We live in a street of terraced houses and parking is a nightmare. But with a car as short as the 500 you can often squeeze into a space where others can\u2019t.

Both her parents were teachers with her elder sister, Luci, following in their footsteps, but Silvia wanted to be a doctor. And thus she became in the early 1970s, during the military dictatorship in her country.<\/p> <p>It was at this point of her life that she first came across the growing movement of activists following the teachings of Silo. This was to be the pivotal moment of her life and changed her forever. His message of how to heal suffering resonated strongly with her, \u201cOnly inner faith and inner meditation can end the violence in you, in others, and in the world around you,\u201d but the strange characters she came across at the time dissuaded her from participating formally!<\/p> <p>Her work with the doctors\u2019 trade union eventually led to a four week period of incarceration during Argentina\u2019s most bloody war against its own people: she was one person among tens of thousands of people arrested at the hands of the military, many of whom were much less fortunate than her. Silvia didn\u2019t need a second warning. Upon her release she kept her head down, earned and borrowed all the money she could and took the first boat to Barcelona where she immediately contacted Siloists who had also established themselves there and started to grow their groups.<\/p> <p>It was through Siloism that she eventually met the man who would be the love of her life, friend, partner and, eventually, her husband, Jon. Siloists from all over the world met in the Canary Islands in 1978 and Silvia met Jon and immediately fell for him (\u201cI had a thing for guys who looked like Jesus Christ\u201d, she told me once) despite the fact that neither spoke more than a few words of the other\u2019s language.<\/p> <p>In 1981, after a 3-year complicated situation for both Silvia and Jon, she moved to London with some rudimentary English and immersed herself into the Humanist Movement which was then developing in the UK. The timing was slightly unfortunate, however, as she almost ended up incarcerated a second time when the Falklands War broke out in April 1982 as the British authorities seriously considered rounding up all Argentine nationals in the country \u201cfor their own protection\u201d.<\/p> <p>Silvia\u2019s Argentinian medical qualifications were not wholly recognised in the UK and thus she had to take UK medical exams and decided to specialise in psychiatry. Eventually Silvia would rise up to be one of the country\u2019s leading forensic psychiatrists, dealing with the most violent female murderers. She spent lots of her professional time in prisons and in court rooms working out how to stop these women from harming themselves and others.<\/p> <p>But her career was never her life. Her life was in Siloism. As for many Siloists, it was the only philosophy that made any sense among all the physical, economic, psychological, sexual, racial and moral violence that the system imposed on the global population every day. In the 80s, she spent hours of her spare time on the streets talking to people about the need for simultaneous personal and social change, building groups of the Community for Human Development, the Humanist Party, the Humanist Movement and later on the Centre of Cultures.<\/p> <p>It was in those days (December 1988) that she met me, an innocent boy from the countryside who knew nothing about anything very important, and spent hours inspiring me to transform my own life using the techniques developed in the Humanist Movement. It was magical the way she told the stories and the way she explained the doctrine. I would sit there in awe, falling in love with the world she was painting in my head, thinking to myself, how will I ever have the capacity to remember all this so that I can repeat it to others? No matter what the situation I found myself in, no matter what the difficulty, Silvia always knew the right part of Silo\u2019s teachings to look in, the right technique, the right anecdote to share.<\/p> <p>Together we tried to humanise first Highgate the neighbourhood where she lived, and then Camberwell where I lived. When that didn\u2019t work very well we launched ourselves overseas joining the growing cohort of humanists who were developing missions to new parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.<\/p> <p>We arrived in Nairobi in August 2000, not knowing what to expect, and ended up coordinating a two-day workshop for 50 people. We couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. For the next 4 years we travelled frequently to Kenya repeating the experience to increasing numbers of people who, we naively thought, saw the world the same way we did. Silvia, inspired by these experiences, started to repeat them in Colombia. Taking sometimes extraordinary risks by travelling by bus through the Colombian countryside in a time of open civil war. She also returned to Barcelona, re-connecting with many friends who she had worked with before in the 1970s. This re-connection brought her enormous joy.<\/p> <p>Silvia, for me, was characterised by her towering intellect and she eventually turned this to writing. In the 1990s she started writing her first book, From Monkey Sapiens to Homo Intentional[1] which was eventually published in 2006. It contained her insights into humanism, psychoanalysis, sociology and behavioural psychology, violence, Darwinism, economics and science, among many other subjects. It was all her take on the world through the lens of Silo\u2019s teaching, and I remember her being absolutely terrified to send Silo a copy! He was possibly the only person who made Silvia ever doubt herself. He gave it his seal of approval, though.<\/p> <p>When Pressenza was launched in 2009 amid the preparations for the World March for Peace and Nonviolence, Silvia joined whole-heartedly. She always had something interesting to say about any current situation in the news and was one of the agency\u2019s most prolific writers. There are 954 entries attributed to Silvia in our archive, translated to all our languages!<\/p> <p>Silvia\u2019s last major writing was a monograph titled, \u201cThe Space of Representation as a Psychosocial Experience, A Psychology of the image, Intentionality, impulses and transcendence at the service of the non-violent revolution\u201d[2]. Silo\u2019s contribution to psychology through his development of the scheme of the consciousness and the space of representation fascinated her. As a psychiatrist she could see all the shortcomings of what western medicine was doing in the fields of psychology and psycho-analysis, but she was wise enough to see where it was doing things well, and also how Siloist Psychology could make a contribution. She rushed to finish her monograph when she was diagnosed in December 2016 with what was a probably mistaken diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The doctors never did find out what was the root of the problem inside her body, but what is certain is that it led to the leukaemia that eventually dealt the final blow.<\/p> <p>The last period since that diagnosis led Silvia to some of the most profound experiences of her life. She dedicated herself to finally resolving all traces of contradiction in her life, reconciling with absolutely everything and everyone. A team of friends all over the world supported her in that period: Ariane, Dani, Karen, Danny, Inma, Monica, Dario, and many, many more in visits to London and from a distance, were able to support her and help her to purify.<\/p> <p>We were all held in a limbo with Silvia\u2019s situation. So many times we thought we were in the last days, and so many times she was stronger than the illnesses that I started to refer to her as my immortal friend! There were dark days, but mostly there were fantastic days. She took her last days of lucidity in hospital in that isolation room, to do a final personal retreat and clean up any loose ends. She stayed absolutely lucid until about 4 days before she left us. That\u2019s how she wanted to go. Brilliant in mind until the end! There\u2019s a document on her computer somewhere with a synthesis of the experience of the last three years which I\u2019m looking forward to reading one day.<\/p> <p>Silvia leaves us in possibly the most interesting time in human history since the Italian Renaissance. The coronavirus pandemic is twisting the world into new paths that were never before imaginable. She was here to witness the opening of a door to a new civilisation, but she wasn\u2019t able to walk through it with us.<\/p> <p>She joins many of her most important guides in the constellation of the great who have come before us in the task of humanising the Earth and paving the way to the brilliant world that she painted in my head all those years ago.<\/p> <p>All of us in Pressenza and everyone who ever knew her will be today giving thanks for the time she spent together with us and for the positive contribution that she was able to make in so many of our lives.<\/p> <p>Silvia Swinden n\u00e9e Bercu (1949 \u2013 2020) leaves behind her husband, Jon and her elder sister Luci.<\/p> <p>Below, we copy the text of the Siloist ceremony of Death, from the book Silo\u2019s Message. No more poignant or useful words are available at this moment.<\/p> <p>Life has ceased in this body. We must now make an effort to separate in our minds the image of this body from the image of the person we remember\u2026<\/p> <p>This body does not hear us. This body is not the person we remember\u2026<\/p> <p>May those who do not feel the presence here of another life, separate from the body, consider that although death has paralysed this body, the actions they carried out will continue to act, and their influence will never end. This chain of actions that was set in motion in life cannot be stopped by death. How profound it is to meditate on this truth, even though we may not completely comprehend the transformation of one action into another!<\/p> <p>And, may those who feel the presence of another separate life, consider that death has only paralysed this body, that the mind has once again triumphantly freed itself, opening its way towards the Light\u2026<\/p> <p>Whatever our views, let us not weep for this body. Rather, let us meditate on the root of our beliefs, and a gentle and silent joy will reach us\u2026<\/p> <p>Peace in the heart, light in the understanding!<\/p> <p>[1] Swinden, S (2006) From Monkey Sapiens to Homo Intentional: The Phenomenology of the Non-Violent Revolution London: Adonis & Abbey Publishers<\/p> <p>[2] Swinden, S (2019) The Space of Representation as a Psychosocial Experience, A Psychology of the image, Intentionality, impulses and transcendence at the service of the non-violent revolution, France: La Belle Id\u00e9e Park of Study and Reflection, accessible at: https:\/\/www.parclabelleidee.fr\/monographies.php<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"31HLTCK4BNA9ZTZ8ZF0DRC2LL03GVW"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":1206,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Argentina","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Silvia Swinden","victim_keywords":"doctor, Siloist, trade union activist, political prisoner, released, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"political activists, citizens, civilians, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Argentina","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Silvia Swinden","victim_keywords":"doctor, Siloist, trade union activist, political prisoner, released, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"political activists, citizens, civilians, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":897097254,"Input.title":"Again, another six persons kidnapped in Abuja","Input.publish_date":"2020-01-06 17:41:30","Input.article_interface":"<p>About six persons were reportedly kidnapped by yet to be identified gunmen at Zuma community in Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.<\/p> <p>Although the report was still sketchy as at the time of filing this report, Tribune Online reliably gathered that the victims were abducted at different locations within the area council.<\/p> <p>Investigations by our Correspondent further revealed that while some were abducted at public centres, others were picked up in a farm.<\/p> <p>According to one of the witnesses, who did not want her name in print: \u201cJosephine Danlami was one of the victims.

Siddiqui ended up on Attorney General John Ashcroft\u2019s \u201cWatchlist.\u201d As the Big Lies of government grew, soon the New York Post was calling her \u201cLady Al Queda.\u201d<\/p> <p>Once the government labeled her a \u201cterrorist,\u201d she had no chance of escaping the Empire\u2019s punishment. When her true story began to emerge, it was necessary to take action. While visiting in Pakistan, helped by Pakistani American operatives, she was \u201cdisappeared.\u201d Her youngest child was killed when she was taken, and her other two children imprisoned separately for years. She was beaten, raped, tortured and kept in solitary in black site prisons of the American Empire, particularly in Afghanistan. Other prisoners have testified that they saw her at Bagram, a prison from which the Obama administration prevented prisoners\u2019 court appearances because they might talk about the conditions of their imprisonment. Eventually Aafia Siddiqui would be set up for final punishment and disposal.<\/p> <p>From my book Women Politicals in America:<\/p> <p>At the trial\u2014in January 2010\u2014the soldiers said that Aafia Siddiqui, accused would-be assassin and presumed Al Qaeda terrorist, did, in fact, get hold of an unsecured M-4 automatic rifle and open fire on US soldiers and FBI agents in Ghazni, Afghanistan. The day before, she had been picked up by local policemen as a \u201cpossible suicide bomber\u201d because she had been \u201cloitering\u201d in a public square with a young boy [whose identity is not clear]. She carried instructions to create biological weapons, descriptions of US \u201cmilitary assets,\u201d numerous jars containing \u201cchemical substances,\u201d and documents containing words like \u201cEmpire State Building\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn Bridge.\u201d The soldiers said that the day after her discovery and arrest, an American army captain, a warrant officer, two army interpreters and two FBI agents came to question Siddiqui at Ghazni police headquarters. The soldiers said that none of those men were \u201caware that Siddiqui was being held, unsecured, behind [a] curtain.\u201d Oddly, no one looked behind it. And also oddly, the American warrant officer placed his M-4 rifle next to the curtain. What happened next, said the soldiers, was that Siddiqui pulled the rifle to her, unlatched the safety, pointed the gun at the captain, and while one of the interpreters grabbed for the gun, Siddiqui fired the gun twice. The soldiers agreed she had said, \u201cGet the fuck out of here!\u201d She hit no one. The soldiers said the interpreter knocked her to the ground and the warrant officer fired \u201capproximately two rounds\u201d into Siddiqui\u2019s stomach. She collapsed, unconscious. FBI special Agent Eric Negron testified at her trial that he saw the rifle raised (although he could not see her face behind the curtain). Negron said that after she was shot he helped restrain the struggling Siddiqui. \u201cI had to strike her several times with a closed fist across the face.\u201d Finally she \u201ceither fainted or faked that she had fainted\u201d and was handcuffed. The soldiers had successfully restrained the suspected terrorist Siddiqui. Although her prints were not on the rifle, the holes in the police station wall put there by the rifle Siddiqui allegedly fired were proved to have been there before the July 2008 incident, and since, if she had tried to kill the soldiers, she missed and was herself grievously shot in the abdomen, her sentence seemed disproportionate. Aafia Siddiqui was given 86 years in prison. She had been labeled a terrorist enemy of the Empire and its soldiers, and her case was disposed of accordingly.<\/p> <p>Siddiqui had been extradited for the offense of attempting to kill soldiers, but she was tried, completely illegally, as a notorious female terrorist. She was not allowed to speak of her torture or the killing of her baby. The trial\u2014then as now\u2014of a \u201cterrorist, as with Julian Assange, allows for only the government\/prosecutorial side. The defendant cannot win. Siddiqui was also in very bad shape, physically and mentally during her trial, with a badly dressed stomach wound that the judge had to intervene to have treated. She was forced to undergo strip searches every day and was forced to testify. When she mentioned being in a secret prison, with her children tortured in front of her, the testimony was stricken from the record. She also, and this is arguably something the hostage-taker Malik Faisad Akram was aware of, did not want \u201cZionists\u201d chosen as jurors and said her guilty verdict came from Israel, not America. Some said she was irrational which was entirely possible, but with the anti-Muslim elements of her trial, perhaps not so irrational.<\/p> <p>She has been in prison since 2010 and has, according to her family, suffered unjust punishments within the prison, and her medical problems are not treated. For much of the last 11 years, she has also not been able to communicate with her family. According to the Free Aafia website, maintained by her family and friends, she was attacked last July and suffered serious injuries. After a number of years, she and her family are still waiting for Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan to follow through on promises to help free her from the Empire\u2019s prison. For the press to continue to call her a hardened terrorist and to overlook the treatment, the torture she has endured at American hands, echoes the ignorant liberal sentiment that Afghanistan is so much worse off without the American government there to torture and kill.

Hamas does not want the world to know that young men and women living under its rule in the Gaza Strip, have, as a result of economic hardship and oppression, been taking their own lives.<\/p> <p>In the past week alone, four Palestinians from the Gaza Strip reportedly committed suicide in separate incidents \u2014 by gunfire, pills, self-immolation, and jumping from a tall building. The suicides have embarrassed Hamas, whose leaders decided to take strict measures to stop the news from leaking to the media.<\/p> <p>Thirteen years after its violent takeover of the Gaza Strip, Hamas is still seeking to present a rosy picture of the situation there. Hamas wants to show the world that life for many Palestinians under its Islamic rule and repressive measures is wonderful.<\/p> <p>The reality, however, is a bit different. Under Hamas control, the Gaza Strip has suffered from rising unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and a sharp contraction of the private sector.<\/p> <p>Since 2017, the Palestinian Authority government in the West Bank \u2013 Judea and Samaria \u2013 has reduced payments for electricity supplied by Israel to the Gaza Strip and cut salaries for its employees, exacerbating the local economic crisis. Since 2014, Egypt\u2019s crackdown on the Gaza Strip\u2019s extensive tunnel smuggling network has exacerbated fuel, construction material, and consumer goods shortages.<\/p> <p>Last year, Palestinian activists took to the streets of the Gaza Strip to protest economic hardship and demand that Hamas provide solutions for soaring unemployment and poverty rates. The protests, held under the banner \u201cWe want to live!,\u201d were brutally suppressed by Hamas\u2019s security forces and militiamen. Hundreds of activists were detained by Hamas, which saw the economic protests as part of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to \u201ccreate instability and anarchy\u201d and undermine its dictatorial regime in the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>One of the organizers of the protests was Sleman Alajoury, a 24-year-old activist and unemployed university graduate from the northern Gaza Strip. Alajoury was detained several times by Hamas for his role in the widespread protests, described as the worst since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip after toppling the government of PA President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.<\/p> <p>On July 4, one year after the protests were crushed by Hamas, Alajoury\u2019s body was discovered inside his home in the Sheikh Zayed suburb in the northern Gaza Strip. His friends and family members said that the young man had committed suicide with a single shot to the head.<\/p> <p>In his last posting on Facebook, a few hours before he took his life, Alajoury wrote that his suicide was aimed at seeking \u201csalvation.\u201d He also wrote that \u201ccomplaining to anyone but God was an act of humiliation.\u201d<\/p> <p>Alajoury\u2019s words are perceived by many Palestinians as implicit criticism of Hamas over its failure to improve living conditions in the Gaza Strip and its ongoing crackdown on young activists campaigning for a better life, democracy and freedom of speech.<\/p> <p>Ramzi Mahmoud Suleiman, a friend of Alajoury, said that Alajoury had suffered greatly under Hamas\u2019s oppressive measures. Suleiman said that Alajoury had been detained by Hamas security forces, who raided his home on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>Another friend, Shaher al-Habbash, revealed that Alajoury was frequently targeted by Hamas because of his political and social activities in the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>\u201cHamas\u2019s Internal Security Force arrested him several times,\u201d al-Habbash said. \u201cThey attacked his family home and humiliated him during his interrogation inside Hamas prisons. They even raided the home during his sister\u2019s wedding; this bothered him a lot.\u201d<\/p> <p>Several other cases of suicide attempts have been recorded there in the past few weeks.<\/p> <p>Instead of addressing the problem, Hamas is now trying to sweep Alajoury\u2019s tragic death under the carpet.<\/p> <p>Some Palestinians who attended his funeral or visited the family home to offer condolences have been detained by Hamas security officers and militiamen.<\/p> <p>Kidnapped by Hamas\u2019 Military Wing<\/p> <p>One Palestinian, Basim Othman, wrote on Facebook that his brother, Fadi, and three other men were \u201ckidnapped\u201d by members of Hamas\u2019s military wing, Ezaddin al-Qassem, after attending the funeral. \u201cOur message is clear: Hamas is a terrorist organization,\u201d Othman wrote. \u201cWe will teach the kidnappers and their families a lesson.\u201d<\/p> <p>Another Palestinian, Ramez Mahmoud, wrote on his Facebook page that he had escaped a kidnap attempt by the Hamas militiamen after the funeral of Alajoury. \u201cI just survived a kidnaping attempt by security forces belonging to Hamas and its military wing,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cThey kidnapped my friend, journalist Yusef Hassan, and others who came to offer condolences to the Alajoury family.\u201d<\/p> <p>A Palestinian human rights group condemned the Hamas crackdown on Alajoury\u2019s friends and other activists and called for a thorough examination into the increased spate of suicides in the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe [Hamas] security services in Gaza arrested at least nine persons in three separate incidents on July 4, 2020, who were attending the funeral of Sleman Alajoury,\u201d the Al-Mezan Center For Human Rights said in a statement.<\/p> <p>\u201cAl-Mezan\u2019s field investigations show that members of the security services in Gaza arrested Ghasan Sadi Musalam, 37, Fadi Mohammed Othman, 38, and Khalil Adib Salim, 33, at around 1:30 pm near Beit Lahia\u2019s cemetery in the northern Gaza Strip, just after they had left Alajoury\u2019s funeral.\u201d<\/p> <p>The human rights group also pointed out that Hamas had arrested two journalists who were covering the funeral. They were identified as Ahmed al-Ras, 35, and Helmi al-Ghoul, 26, and were interrogated about the nature of their work, before being released.<\/p> <p>\u201cFour more persons were arrested after visiting the deceased man\u2019s family to pay their respects,\u201d Al-Mezan revealed.<\/p> <p>\u201cOfficers of the security services traveling in a blue vehicle and a white mini-bus stopped the four men, two of whom were identified as Yousef Khalil Hassan, and Ahmed Awni al-Mahali, and transferred them to the police station, before releasing all four the same day.\u201d<\/p> <p>The human rights group said that some of those detained by Hamas were summoned back for further interrogation in the coming days. \u201cOthers reported being beaten and verbally abused during interrogations surrounding posts they made on social media that called for peaceful assemblies, and their cell phones were confiscated,\u201d the group added.<\/p> <p>\u201cAl-Mezan condemns the incidents and demands a halt to the arbitrary arrests and summons orders that are carried out in violation of due process, and stresses that duty-bearers are obligated, under Palestinian and international law, to promote public liberties and respect human rights, notably freedom of opinion, expression and peaceful assembly.<\/p> <p>\u201cAl-Mezan further affirms that the problem of suicide in Gaza is symptomatic of the rising level of frustration and despair felt among Palestinian inhabitants.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hamas Fears the World Will Wake Up<\/p> <p>Such calls by human rights organizations are dismissed out of hand by Hamas leaders, whose only concern is the iron grip of their power. For Hamas, Palestinians who commit suicide imperil its regime, even \u2014 and perhaps more so \u2014 after their death.<\/p> <p>Why is Hamas chasing Palestinians to cemeteries and to the homes of grieving families? Because its leaders are terrified that the world will wake up to the fact that their ruinous rule is driving young men and women to commit suicide.<\/p> <p>Hamas, after 13 years of criminal negligence, rejects responsibility for the wellbeing of its people. Astoundingly, it continues to succeed in convincing the world that Israel is to blame for the misery of its own people. This convenient and toxic lie enables it to continue receiving money and weapons from its friends in Iran and Hezbollah to tighten its death grip on the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>For Hamas, jihad (holy war), not a decent life for its people, is what matters. Tragically, it seems that young Palestinians in Gaza are getting the message \u2014 loud and clear.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"302U8RURJ1GF9LGUMJD8HWBIMCPNVB"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1622,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","killing","other"],"year":"2020","month":"07","date":"4.0","city":"Gaza","region":"None","country":"Palestine","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sleman Alajoury","victim_keywords":"detained, raided, suicide","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahmed al-Ras","victim_keywords":"arrested, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Helmi al-Ghoul","victim_keywords":"arrested, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ramez Mahmoud","victim_keywords":"kidnapped, escaped","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Yusef Hassan","victim_keywords":"kidnapped, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","killing","other"],"year":"2020","month":"07","date":"4.0","city":"Gaza","region":"None","country":"Palestine","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sleman Alajoury","victim_keywords":"detained, raided, suicide","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahmed al-Ras","victim_keywords":"arrested, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Helmi al-Ghoul","victim_keywords":"arrested, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ramez Mahmoud","victim_keywords":"kidnapped, escaped","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Yusef Hassan","victim_keywords":"kidnapped, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1005377089,"Input.title":"From La Tonde\u00f1a to modern day unions: The continuous struggle against dictatorship and oppression","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-22 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By RUTH LUMIBAO<\/p> <p>Bulatlat.com<\/p> <p>MANILA \u2014 \u201cTama na! Sobra na! Wakasan na!\u201d<\/p> <p>The people\u2019s resounding call did not start yesterday. Decades ago, this was the same battle cry against the Marcos dictatorship, originating from one of the most legendary feats of the workers\u2019 movement: the La Tonde\u00f1a strike.<\/p> <p>Only three years after Marcos imposed Martial Law, thousands of people, including about 800 workers of the largest distillery in Asia at that time, braved the wrath of state fascism and picketed to assert their rights. Workers were hired for eight weeks, thereafter terminated, and then rehired as contractuals. They went to the National Labor Relations Commissions (NLRC) \u2013 30 times to be exact \u2013 to no avail. Justifiably, it was in the middle of this massive strike where student activist Edgar Jopson called, \u201cTama na! Sobra na! Welga na!\u201d<\/p> <p>After the La Tonde\u00f1a strike, more than 200 other strikes broke out nationwide. More than 70,000 workers were involved and were supported by the church, youth, women, and other sectors. Their protests took many forms \u2013 silent strikes, sit-down strikes, slowdowns, mass leaves, stretching of the break period, among others.<\/p> <p>Rattled with the resounding call for ouster and justice, the Marcos dictatorship devised means to curtail workers\u2019 rights, ending up with the pro-capitalist Labor Code of the Philippines, an ingrained labor policy that the country hails up to this day, a labor disputes commission marred with bribery and corruption, and undue restriction over the workers\u2019 strongest weapons \u2013 the right to strike, and the right to form unions.<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship\u2019s labor policy<\/p> <p>Prior to the declaration of Martial Law, the Philippine economy was already struck in a spiraling crisis. The National Census and Statistics Office (NCSO; now the Philippine Statistics Authority or PSA) recorded almost a 20-percent rate of unemployment in 1931. According to the 1977 Yearbook of Labor Statistics, 78 percent of the total 6.347 million families in the Philippines in 1971 earned below P3,000 annually, and 41 percent of families earned P2,000 per year. Consequently, a Filipino family would have had to subsist on P5-P8 per day.<\/p> <p>With prevailing economic conditions pushing the Filipino people further into poverty, strikes and uprisings became inevitable. Thus, towards the goal of curtailing the freedom of speech, of organization, and other fundamental human rights, Marcos orchestrated events building up to the imposition of Martial Law.<\/p> <p>To control the spike of strikes and workers\u2019 movements, Marcos made it a point to codify all existing labor laws of the Philippines. Showing utmost subservience to the United States, he welcomed the Rannis Mission with open arms and adopted their recommendations to the labor code \u2013 the same labor code we have up to this day.<\/p> <p>The late Marxist political economist Edberto Villegas explained in his book, \u201cThe Political Economy of Philippine Labor Laws\u201d that the Rannis Mission \u2018pushed for an export-oriented industrialization and liberalization of imports in the Philippines, advising against trade protectionism and import-substitution.\u2019 The mission was named after Gustav Rannis, its head, and was sponsored by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the World Bank (WB).<\/p> <p>Consequently, the Rannis Mission laid the foundations for labor policies that prevail even up to this day.<\/p> <p>1. Heightened export of labor and the OFW phenomenon<\/p> <p>The Labor Code then created the Overseas Employment Development Board (OEDB) and National Seaman Board (NSB) to take care of recruitment for overseas jobs. OEDB looked for employment for Filipinos abroad. Annually, 112,191 workers are deployed abroad, the Middle East being the most common destination.<\/p> <p>Benefitting from these, a journal of the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) cited how much host countries gained from the Filipinos\u2019 cheap labor: US$50.9 billion.<\/p> <p>Supposedly a temporary solution to the lack of jobs in the country, deployment overseas has, rather, become the norm. Dollar-earning remittances became an easy solution for the government to increase revenue without putting out too much from its pockets. It capitalized on the Filipino laborer\u2019s willingness to take on low-paying jobs abroad, lest be stuck inside the country without any job at all. This has left the modern-day heroes now called Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) vulnerable to rights violations and severely abusive work environments.<\/p> <p>2. The institutionalization of contractualization<\/p> <p>In the mid-1970s to 1980s, Marcos issued a decree allowing the hiring of workers on contract for special work, thus marking the beginning of a long struggle against contractualization. This was further institutionalized after being recognized in the Labor Code and with the Department of Labor (DOL) issuing several rules for the implementation of labor contracting and sub-contracting.<\/p> <p>READ MORE: The Mall Empire that Slavery Built<\/p> <p>3. Cheap labor and cost-saving schemes for capitalists<\/p> <p>How else can the government generate jobs? Supposedly, it would be through the strengthening of local industries. But the answer every past administration has to this question is a resounding \u2018open door\u2019 policy. Instead of enhancing workers\u2019 skills, especially that of the youth, the government always rushes to shove them into low-paying, low-skilled jobs.<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship established the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) in 1969. It established training institutions in the country, which according to the Labor Code, \u201cwill ensure the efficient allocation, development and utilization of the nation\u2019s manpower and thereby promote employment\u2026\u201d La Salle School of Arts and Trades, Marikina SAT, Bataan SAT, Pangasinan SAT, Iloilo SAT, Bicol University, and a lot more participated in the program.<\/p> <p>Private corporations that promised to shoulder the costs of NMYC training of future laborers were granted a tax deduction of 50 percent. Easily said, the employment of Filipino workers became synonymous with company savings.<\/p> <p>Similarly, the Labor Code produced by the Marcos regime promoted apprenticeship. In principle, it is understood to be training and preparation for a job, but in actuality, the program is abused as a means for cheap labor, child labor, and other workers\u2019 rights violation. Similar to the effect of the institution of NMYC\u2019s training programs, companies that implemented apprenticeship programs were granted a tax deduction of 50 percent.<\/p> <p>Ironically, workers\u2019 productivity and the rise of employment due to this scheme did not encourage the government to increase their wages, and actually resulted in the complete opposite \u2013 the maintenance of cheap wage levels in exchange for a flourishing export program.<\/p> <p>As a result, the number of vocational workers rose quickly, even overtaking the number of agricultural workers in a supposedly agricultural country. And, analogously, the services sector employs the largest number of workers even up to this day.<\/p> <p>4. Anti-union policies and practices<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship did not want another La Tonde\u00f1a, and thus incorporated in the Labor Code and its own implementation of labor laws all means to stop one.<\/p> <p>Under the Labor Code, what seems to be a provision protecting the economy is actually for the protection of investors. The prohibition of strikes in vital industries became a systematic impediment on the workers\u2019 right to strike. According to Marcos\u2019 Letter of Instruction NO. 368, the Secretary of Labor has the discretion on which industries to include and exclude from the list.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, even if the right to strike was still recognized (if not merely mentioned as a formality), the Labor Code prohibited the collection of strike contributions by unions and stated that all strike funds should be transferred to labor education and research purposes. A strike does not usually last for a day, and persists until the employer or management becomes willing to negotiate or to respect the workers\u2019 demands. At that time, and still a reaction to the series of nationwide strikes, Marcos imposed a ban on foreign donations to Philippine trade unions, unless permitted by the Minister of Labor. To deprive them of their capacity to raise funds among themselves for a strike directly affects their right to hold one.<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship likewise played with the classification and re-classification of \u2018unfair labor practices\u2019 or union busting from an administrative offense to a criminal offense. Nonetheless, this did not prevent management from imposing preventive suspension on workers suspected of participating in an upcoming strike. A workers\u2019 argument for unfair labor practices falls, therefore, and becomes relegated to a case of illegal dismissal.<\/p> <p>The establishment of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for compulsory arbitration likewise served as a barrier to the realization of justice and respect for workers\u2019 rights. Briberies were rampant. Amado Inciong, then Undersecretary of the Department of Labor (DOL), narrated in an interview how a manager of the Manila Hilton Hotel paid a commission for \u2018services rendered\u2019. These amounts range from P150,000 to P500,000 each.<\/p> <p>49 years later<\/p> <p>Marcos imposed these policies with the pretense of generating more jobs, boosting the economy, and making the Philippines Asia\u2019s tiger. The reasons go on and on. But so did Aquino. So did Ramos. So did Estrada. So did Arroyo. So did another Aquino. And, presently, so does Duterte, even at a larger and more destructive scale.<\/p> <p>Fast forward 49 years after Marcos imposed Martial Law and used his iron fist to clamp down workers\u2019 rights and workers\u2019 movements, the labor sector continues to rise.<\/p> <p>Crisis cannot be denied. The objective conditions will always push the oppressed to fight. It is but a natural reaction for someone offended to seek justice, and for one deprived of justice to assert. Truth be told, La Tonde\u00f1a strike workers had foreseen it all along: that their victory was not a culmination, but a commencement of a bigger and more all-encompassing struggle against oppression and exploitation.<\/p> <p>The strikes of Nestle, Coca-Cola, NutriAsia, and many other unions are reminders that the legacy of La Tonde\u00f1a strike lives on.

The Yemeni Army yesterday released footage of a large-scale military offensive in which three Saudi brigades were completely destroyed and thousands of militiamen taken hostage.<\/p> <p>This comes on top of the offensive two weeks ago where Houthi drone attacks took out Saudi Arabia\u2019s key oil facilities, shutting their oil production down by 50 per cent, causing the world oil prices to rocket overnight and throwing both the Saudi rulers and the US rulers into an unprecedented crisis.<\/p> <p>On Revolution Day (September 26) which set the stage for the creation of the modern Republic of Yemen by overthrowing the Saudi-backed rulers of northern Yemen in 1962, Houthi leader Mahdi al-Mashat, made the Saudis the following offer: You end the war on Yemen and we will end our attacks on Saudi Arabia.<\/p> <p>Saudi Arabia and its allies launched the war on Yemen in March 2015 in an unsuccessful attempt to reinstall a former regime. The Saudis have rained bombs down on the people of Yemen for four long years, killing tens of thousands of men, women and children. They have targeted hospitals, hit schools, and destroyed the infrastructure. As a result a terrible cholera epidemic erupted infecting 1.2 million and killing two and a half thousand.<\/p> <p>The Saudi aggression has further displaced millions and left 24.1 million, more than two-thirds of the Yemeni population in need of aid, with 10 million suffering from starvation.<\/p> <p>The United Nations welcomed the proposal by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement to halt strikes on Saudi Arabia in return for an end to the Saudi-led coalition war on Yemen. UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths stressed \u2018the importance of taking advantage of this opportunity and moving forward with all necessary steps to reduce violence, military escalation and unhelpful rhetoric.\u2019<\/p> <p>However, the Houthis added a warning. They warned both the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates to leave the war-wracked country or face \u2018crippling attacks\u2019 on \u2018their own soil\u2019.

Yemeni soldiers and allied fighters from Popular Committees do not hesitate to target the fleeing Saudi forces and mercenaries, setting a number of their military vehicles ablaze.<\/p> <p>The video then shows several armoured vehicles overturned, and dozens of Saudi troopers surrendering to Yemeni forces with both their hands raised in air. There were dozens of bodies strewn everywhere.<\/p> <p>The spokesman for Yemeni Armed Forces insisted that almost 200 Saudi troops lost their lives as a result of the operation in Najran and thousands of militiamen were taken hostage.<\/p> <p>This is a war which the Saudi-led coalition is losing!<\/p> <p>It is a blow to Saudi Arabia and it is a blow to US, UK and French imperialism, who supply the Saudis with the weapons they use to carry out their war.<\/p> <p>A new report by Amnesty International says that the US, the UK and France, which provide arms to the Riyadh regime, are complicit in \u2018serious violations of international law, including possible war crimes\u2019 committed by the kingdom during the war.<\/p> <p>Britain sells at least \u00a34.7bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia.

national security law on Monday, detained over suspected collusion with foreign forces as around 200 police searched the offices of his Apple Daily newspaper.<\/p> <p>Mainland-born Lai, who was smuggled into the British colony of Hong Kong on a fishing boat when he was a penniless 12-year-old, has been one of the most prominent democracy activists in the now Chinese-ruled city and an ardent critic of Beijing.<\/p> <p>His arrest comes amid Beijing\u2019s crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in the city and further stokes concerns about media and other promised freedoms when it returned to China in 1997. China imposed the sweeping new security law on Hong Kong on June 30, drawing condemnation from Western countries.<\/p> <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by reports of the arrest, calling it further proof that the Chinese Communist Party had \u201ceviscerated\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and eroded the rights of its people.<\/p> <p>The arrest \u201cbears out the worst fears that Hong Kong\u2019s national security law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom\u201d, said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Asia programme coordinator.<\/p> <p>Ryan Law, chief editor of Apple Daily, a staunch anti-government tabloid that also does investigative work, told Reuters the paper would not be intimidated.<\/p> <p>\u201cBusiness as usual,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>The security law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. Critics say it crushes freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year.<\/p> <p>Beijing said it supported Lai\u2019s arrest.<\/p> <p>A spokesman for China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office told the official Xinhua news agency Lai was a representative of people who were \u201canti-China, anti-Hong Kong\u201d and that he planned and instigated \u201cillegal\u201d protests, funded pro-independence forces and used his media group to spread rumours.<\/p> <p>Lai, 71, had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a \u201ctraitor\u201d.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong police said they had arrested nine men and one woman, aged between 23 and 72, without naming them, adding that further arrests were possible.<\/p> <p>Suspected offences included \u201ccollusion with a foreign country\/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud\u201d and others, the police said.<\/p> <p>Apple Daily posted on its Facebook page a livestream of police officers roaming through its newsroom and rifling through files, and asking staff for identity documents.<\/p> <p>Some executive offices were sealed off with red cordons. The police later wheeled in stacks of empty plastic containers. Lai himself was brought back to the office, initially in handcuffs.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t worry that much, we can only go with the flow,\u201d Lai said, before being escorted into a police vehicle.<\/p> <p>Police said around 200 officers entered the premises with a court warrant and collected 25 boxes of evidence after finishing the search. The law allows police to search premises without one \u201cunder exceptional circumstances\u201d.<\/p> <p>Slideshow ( 5 images )<\/p> <p>In major cases in Hong Kong, the central government in Beijing can claim jurisdiction. The legislation allows agents to take suspects across the border for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts.<\/p> <p>Apple Daily reported that one of Lai\u2019s sons, Ian, had also been arrested at his home and later showed his restaurant, Cafe Seasons, being raided by police.<\/p> <p>Shares in Lai's media company Next Digital 0282.HK, which publishes Apple Daily, plunged 16.7% before rebounding to trade 344% higher at one point as online pro-democracy forums called on investors to buy shares to show support.<\/p> <p>\u2018THIRD-WORLD\u2019<\/p> <p>Slideshow ( 5 images )<\/p> <p>Other senior Apple Daily staff, including Executive Director Cheung Kim-hung, were also arrested.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe see this as straight harassment,\u201d an Apple Daily source said, adding that Lai was arrested on suspicion of sedition, criminal fraud and colluding with foreign forces.<\/p> <p>Next Media Trade Union called the search \u201can extremely rare and serious incident in Hong Kong history\u201d, with a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact. It said journalists \u201cwill continue to guard their posts until the last minute\u201d.<\/p> <p>Britain said the arrest was further evidence the security law was \u201ca pretext to silence opposition\u201d.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong Journalists Association chairman Chris Yeung said the search was akin to \u201cthird-world\u201d press freedom suppression.<\/p> <p>Apple Daily executive Chan Pui-man said the newspaper will be published on Tuesday.<\/p> <p>\u201cEven if Apple Daily publish a pile of blank paper tomorrow, we would go and buy a copy,\u201d prominent young activist Joshua Wong said on Twitter.<\/p> <p>Wong\u2019s longtime colleague, Agnes Chow, and two other activists were among those arrested, local media reported.<\/p> <p>In a Reuters interview in May, Lai pledged to stay in Hong Kong and continue to fight for democracy.<\/p> <p>Before Monday, 15 people, including teenagers, had been arrested under the new law.<\/p> <p>The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other officials, drawing mockery and condemnation from Beijing.<\/p> <p>The arrests show Hong Kong \u201cwasn\u2019t intimidated\u201d by sanctions, Global Times editor Hu Xijin said in a tweet.

Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).

He was arrested in 2011 because he called attention to a planned strike by Beijing taxi drivers.<\/p> <p>In 2014, he interviewed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Beijing and asked for America to help \u201cfreedom-loving Chinese\u201d tear down \u201cthe Great Firewall of censorship\u201d constructed by the Chinese government.<\/p> <p>Zhang also asked Kerry to visit the wife of dissident Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Prize-winning human rights advocate and political prisoner who died of liver cancer three years later while under guard in a Chinese hospital, his wife cruelly held under house arrest and kept silent while he wasted away.<\/p> <p>Kerry later asked the regime in Beijing to go easier on censorship and show some compassion for its political prisoners, but nothing came of either request. Kerry claimed his meeting with Zhang and three other Chinese bloggers was the first time he was told American tech companies were helping the Chinese government control Internet access.<\/p> <p>Zhang was subsequently fired from his job as a journalist and editor by online giant Tencent, ostensibly for \u201cleaking business secrets and other confidential and sensitive information.\u201d<\/p> <p>Zhang said he was told by his department head that he was fired for the \u201cradical statements\u201d he made to Kerry, and for exposing CCP propaganda directives. One of those directives forbid all Chinese media for reporting what was said during Kerry\u2019s meeting with Zhang and the other bloggers. The U.S. State Department said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and \u201cvery troubled\u201d that Zhang was fired after talking to Kerry.<\/p> <p>Zhang tried to keep writing without his Tencent position, working to expose the scale and brutality of Chinese censorship, which he warned was growing steadily worse under the leadership of dictator Xi Jinping. He published an article at Foreign Policy in April 2014 ridiculing the CCP\u2019s claims that its growing censorship drive was aimed primarily at cleansing pornography from the Internet:<\/p> <p>The party has long controlled the media. One lever for doing so has been legal ambiguity; China does not have clear regulations governing news, and so it\u2019s unclear when a line has been crossed. The goal of the new campaign is to move the line again, putting pressure on the rights of reporters and netizens who wish to express their own opinions. It\u2019s a method of speech control we\u2019ve seen all too often. Ever since President Xi Jinping came to power in November 2012, central authorities have been tightening the net, detaining a growing number of reporters and netizens. Shortly after Xi took the reins, the CPD prohibited \u201cforeign media personnel\u201d from \u201cirresponsible\u201d Weibos, meaning micro-blog postings, and ordered that certain websites be subject to \u201cmanual review\u201d and strict regulation. The goal was to control the flow of information between Chinese netizens and foreigners. And the CPD is trying to smother mentions of Xu Zhiyong \u2014 it issued a Jan. 26 order prohibiting anything that \u201chypes\u201d the civil society organizer, who was sentenced that day to four years in prison for the spurious charges of \u201cassembling a crowd to disrupt order in a public place.\u201d \u2026 The Chinese constitution explicitly provides for freedom of speech \u2014 but in practice, authorities don\u2019t respect that right at all. China\u2019s Criminal Law already criminalizes \u201cinciting others to overthrow national authorities\u201d and other types of speech. Chinese authorities have erected the so-called Great Firewall of Censorship to keep out foreign social and mainstream media like Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube, not to mention the New York Times.<\/p> <p>His final blog post was published in 2014, but he has been active on Twitter, which is forbidden to Chinese citizens but routinely used by CCP officials, Communist Party internet operatives, and bot networks to spread their propaganda. Vice News noted on Wednesday that official CCP accounts on Twitter have tripled over the past year and their activity has increased by 400 percent, a surge that appears to have been triggered by the protest movement in Hong Kong and intensified as the CCP attempts to control the worldwide political narrative of the Wuhan coronavirus.<\/p> <p>Zhang\u2019s last Tweet was in June, when he posted a photo of his one-day-old daughter in her hospital cart with the message, \u201cEvery life is precious\u201d:<\/p> <p>Zhang\u2019s wife Shao Yuan told Philippine news site Rappler that her husband was taken in for \u201cquestioning\u201d about \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking troubles\u201d on the evening of August 13. She was not told until the following morning that he was under arrest and has not seen him since.<\/p> <p>Shao said she did not \u201cunderstand the reason for this sudden detention,\u201d as her husband had not written a blog post in years and last used Twitter a few months before his arrest.<\/p> <p>\u201cZhang wasn\u2019t able to find any stable work after he lost his job at Tencent.

In 2015, the Justice Department asked for evidence that Britain had gathered on the \u201cBeatles,\u201d saying it was doing its own investigation into Americans who were murdered in Syria.<\/p> <p>British authorities had been willing to provide the U.S. with evidence even without assurances that the men would not be executed if convicted.<\/p> <p>But in July 2018, after lawyers for Elsheikh demanded a review of the decision to allow the men to be put on trial in the U.S., Britain\u2019s Home Office said it had temporarily suspended co-operation with U.S authorities on a potential handover.<\/p> <p>Then, in March, the British Supreme Court held that it was unlawful for the United Kingdom to provide evidence to a foreign country that could be used for a death penalty prosecution. The court has not yet issued its final order, Barr said, but even after that order there could be additional litigation to block transfer of the evidence.<\/p> <p>The IS militants known as the \u201cBeatles\u201d held Western hostages in Syria and tortured many of them, beheading a group of journalists and aid workers in gruesome videos that were released to the world as propaganda.<\/p> <p>The British leader of the \u201cBeatles\u201d cell, Mohammed Emwazi, who was also known as \u201cJihadi John,\u201d was killed in a 2015 drone strike.<\/p> <p>Emwazi was responsible for the beheading of James Foley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist who was killed in Syria six yeas ago after being kidnapped by militants.<\/p> <p>His mother, Diane Foley, said in an interview that she was gratified by the Justice Department\u2019s action, which Barr had said would be coming soon in a conversation with her and other victims\u2019 families this month.<\/p> <p>\u201cI feel that both countries ideally should work together to hold these men accountable and give them a fair trial,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIf they are guilty, they need to be put away for the rest of their lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>She said the only way to stop acts of terrorism was to hold perpetrators accountable.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis would be a huge step, so I am just very, very hopeful and grateful to the attorney general\u201d and the Justice Department, she said.<\/p> <p>_____<\/p> <p>Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.<\/p> <p>Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/etuckerAP<\/p> <p>SHARE:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3EHVO81VN707DDELC7Y65O76BW9H17"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":407,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Syria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Foley","victim_keywords":"journalist, beheaded, victim, Syria","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, aid workers, killed, Syria, tortured","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Syria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Foley","victim_keywords":"journalist, beheaded, victim, Syria","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, aid workers, killed, Syria, tortured","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":890864319,"Input.title":"\u201cThey Won\u2019t Shut Us Up, Leon is Awakening\u201d","Input.publish_date":"2019-12-04 20:32:38","Input.article_interface":"<p>With a broken rib, and still sore from the beating received last Monday at the hands of the Leon Police, Diego Reyes recounts with his wife Maria Eugenia Alonso, the torture and humiliation suffered by his family \u201cso they do not continue being a nuisance,\u201d in retaliation for their activism against the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo.<\/p> <p>The couple, which has suffered a permanent siege during the last months, maintains, however, that they will not silence them and that they will continue denouncing \u201cthe injustices and all the abuses\u201d of the regime, in a struggle that they affirm is peaceful and civic. They maintain that with unity and the vote, in free and transparent elections, that they will be able to get Ortega out of power.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy family feels powerless, it was a terrible impotence that we felt, but this has not been a reason to silence our voice, to always make resistance here in Leon, and throughout Nicaragua. We will never be in favor of injustices, never,\u201d says Alonso, a doctor from Leon.<\/p> <p>In an interview with the journalist Carlos F. Chamorro on the program \u201cEsta Semana,\u201d Reyes denounced that Leon Police Chief, Fidel Dominguez, who personally led the aggression and humiliation against his family, accused him of \u201cwanting to set Leon on fire.\u201d However, Reyes reiterates that he has called the population to calm. He notes that the people of Leon, before a stronghold of the ruling Sandinista Front, are clear of the violations of the regime, being one of the most attacked during the Ortega massacre against the April Rebellion.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is a civic struggle, it is with the vote, it is with the syndrome of the UNO (National Opposition Union, in the 1990 elections) that we are going to win. And, what is the UNO syndrome? Everyone quietly to vote, everyone together\u2026 All against Ortega\u2026and when I say \u201cAll against Ortega,\u201d it is blue and white, blue, red, green, red and black, light blue, yellow, white, salmon\u2026scarlet red, those liberals, conservatives, Sandinistas, MRS, resistance, Catholics and Protestants,\u201d he urged.<\/p> <p>Reyes points out that in Nicaragua \u201cit is not the struggle of four,\u201d but \u201cfor the people of Nicaragua, for the great family of Nicaragua,\u201d because the whole country hurts from the massacre and violations of human rights against those murdered, their families, the wounded, political prisoners, mothers and widows of the victims of the massacre.<\/p> <p>Dr. Alonso thanked \u201call the people that have sympathized with us, who have come, through messages, via telephone, who have come to make themselves present here, and it is daily. This has served to wake people up again, because the fear and terror that they have planted here in Leon, have caused people to lower their heads a little, but this has helped the people to wake up again,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>The drug trafficking excuse<\/p> <p>The Reyes Alonso couple denounces that one of the objectives of the police chief was \u201cto injure us, temporally or permanently incapacitate us,\u201d to silence their voices in opposition to the Daniel Ortega regime.<\/p> <p>Chief Dominguez arrived at the house of the Reyes Alonso without a search warrant and, through blows and a mallet, the officers under his command tried to knock down the door of the house. The family finally chose to open the door, before the cry of the mother of Maria Eugenia.<\/p> <p>Dominguez gave no explanation for the operation and while his underlings beat the family, the police chief accused them of being drug dealers.<\/p> <p>Reyes recalled that his family has lived several months under the siege of the National Police and Ortega\u2019s paramilitaries, who on many occasions came to throw stones at their house. However, in recent weeks they began to \u201ccreate the expectation and atmosphere of doubt,\u201d as a prelude to the attack that finally took place on November 25.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf they (the Police) had shown a warrant, be assured that we would have opened the door, because we have nothing to hide\u2026we are not, and have never been drug dealers,\u201d Reyes upholds.<\/p> <p>The Police also tried also to make him accountable for stoning houses and patrols of the National Police, showing as evidence a pile of stones in a corner of the house, which\u2014according to Reyes\u2014they use to defend themselves, because it was the same Police that stoned the house late at night.<\/p> <p>Despite the allegations by the police chief, the Reyes Alonso family was not arrested nor do they have a court order against them, the alleged evidence was not taken and they only confiscated cell phones, computers, the wedding rings and cash that the Reyes Alonso had for any emergencies.<\/p> <p>Maria Eugenia Alonso, affirms that the money they had in the house is \u201cthe product of the sale of an inheritance\u201d and mentions a notarized receipt of the sale of a property \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t want that tomorrow (the police) would say that the money is a product of the sale of drugs,\u201d thus, \u201cit is better to demonstrate the origin of the money we had at that time,\u201d she adds.<\/p> <p>The attack: videos and darkness<\/p> <p>Part of the attack on the house of the Reyes Alonso was recorded on Facebook, through a live broadcast. In the video you can see the Police pounding the door of the house with a mallet, while the family demands an explanation and, in a corner of the house, Mrs. Margarita Flores de Alonso, 94, cried inconsolably. After eleven minutes the family opens the door and the image goes completely dark. The worst was yet to come.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe opened the side door, here next to where I am, and that\u2019s when they started beating us, and the first beating they gave us was severe, it was practically looking for how to injure us,\u201d Reyes says.<\/p> <p>Alonso adds that since the officers entered the house \u201cthey came over us, hitting us and placing the handcuffs, throwing us to the ground.\u201d She was taken to the streets and thrown on the ground, where they continued \u201ckicking me and putting their boots on my head.\u201d A group of neighbors approached to help her, but riot officers pushed and threatened them.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf anyone gets close, we will kill you\u201d, the officers said.<\/p> <p>While Alonso was kicked in the street, her husband and son Diego Reyes Alonso were also beaten inside the house, \u201clater they took my son and kicked him outside,\u201d the woman says.<\/p> <p>Simultaneously, the officers \u201cransacked the house everywhere: opening drawers, closets, they took cell phones, took computers; until later we realized that the money was missing,\u201d Alonso commented.<\/p> <p>Reyes, who was inside the house, was taken to the corner where his 94-year-old mother-in-law, \u201cwas crying out loudly,\u201d with orders to calm her.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt that moment, I saw a police officer coming out of my daughter\u2019s room with my wallet,\u201d Reyes recalls. The police stole money from the wallet and also took another hidden amount for emergencies.<\/p> <p>The Police also searched \u201ceagerly\u201d for the daughter of the marriage, Barbara Reyes Alonso, who was not at that time in the house, but they believed that she had already returned from the university.<\/p> <p>The humiliation<\/p> <p>After several hours of darkness and uncertainty about what happened in the home of the Reyes Alonso\u2019s, a series of videos began to circulate on social networks in which Police Chief Dominguez is observed coercing them so that they commit themselves \u201cto stop messing with\u201d the Police and Sandinista Front militants.<\/p> <p>In the videos Diego Reyes, Maria Eugenia Alonso and their son Diego Reyes Alonso appear in handcuffs, who after been physically assaulted were forced to repeat the words of the police chief. I pledge to \u201cnot to mess with militants (of the Sandinista Front) or the people. Non-repetition. With Peace you do not play. I am a man of his word,\u201d repeated Reyes, who was the first to be filmed.<\/p> <p>In another room, the officers beat and forced their son to say the same. The parents remember that from the next room they yelled at him: \u201ccommit yourself, son, commit yourself,\u201d so that they wouldn\u2019t continue hitting him. While they listened to Chief Dominguez threatening him: \u201cNow you will know what it is to be a real man, you son of a bitch.\u201d<\/p> <p>Alonso recalls that her son asked Dominguez to take off his handcuffs off (to show him who was the real man) and instead the officers beat him more.<\/p> <p>\u201cPolice arrogance\u201d<\/p> <p>The couple assures that they agreed to make \u201cthe commitment\u201d required by the police chief, because \u201cwe serve more alive and free.\u201d Alonso believed that the police would force them to do something in writing, but not that they would film them with cell phones, to then spread the videos on social networks.<\/p> <p>But contrary to the intention of humiliating the Reyes Alonso with the publication of the videos, the images constitute irrefutable proof of the abuse of authority, torture and cruel treatment exercised by the National Police against citizens.<\/p> <p>Alonso believes that this irrational action is the product of the \u201carrogance\u201d of Chief Dominguez, an attitude that \u201cdid not let him think\u201d of the consequences of his actions.<\/p> <p>The couple believes that possibly the dissemination of the videos \u201cwas done to send a message of terror to the people,\u201d and tell them: \u201clook at your leaders, see how we have them,\u201d but in reality, \u201cthey did not know that it was a boomerang,\u201d she adds.<\/p> <p>Reyes also believes that the videos were leaked because there is a \u201cgreat discomfort\u201d among the ranks of the \u201cdishonest National Police,\u201d because they are \u201cat the service of a dictatorship when it is the people, with their taxes, who pays their salaries, that feeds them.\u201d<\/p> <p>Long-time opponents<\/p> <p>Diego Reyes and Maria Eugenia Alonso are well-known opponents of the Sandinista Front in the city of Leon. In 2008, Reyes was a candidate for deputy mayor for the Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC) along with Ariel Teran, who at that time denounced the electoral fraud through which the Sandinista Front seized more than 40 mayor\u2019s offices of Nicaragua, including several main cities, like Leon, and the capital Managua.<\/p> <p>Alonso, on the other hand, was a candidate as a substitute deputy on the liberal ballot in 2006, and in 2011 she was the PLC departmental election-monitor, date in which she denounced the electoral fraud of the Sandinista Front and contested the elections in Leon.<\/p> <p>In April, 2018, the Reyes Alonso joined the protests motivated in part by their two children, Diego and Barbara, who went out to demonstrate with their classmates of the UNAN-Leon. Diego was in his last year of Systems Engineering, but was expelled from the university, while Barbara continues to study the fourth year of Dentistry.<\/p> <p>Months ago, the Reyes Alonso denounced the Sandinista paramilitaries damaged the roof of the house by throwing stones and, on several occasions, the same Chief Fidel Dominguez came to threaten them with taking them prisoners if they continued protesting against the Government.<\/p> <p>\u201cFrom this moment I hold the Leon Police Chief Fidel de Jes\u00fas Dominguez, the Sandinista Front and the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega-Murillo, responsible for anything that happens to my own family or any of the [extended] Alonso and Reyes families. I hold all these institutions and all the public figures responsible, such as Camilo Baez, Transito Tellez (former mayor), Ever Delgadillo (of the FSLN Departmental office), and the mayor (Roger Gurdian), because they promote and sponsor the paramilitaries, as do all public figures from here, the FSLN deputies,\u201d Alonso warned.<\/p> <p>After being tortured and publicly humiliated, the Reyes Alonso assure that they will continue denouncing the regime and that it is not within their plans to leave their home or the city of Leon.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"31ODACBENWUKKQCI8G0KA3MGSJIQSW"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":373,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":"November","date":null,"city":"Leon","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Diego Reyes","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maria Eugenia Alonso","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":"November","date":null,"city":"Leon","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Diego Reyes","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maria Eugenia Alonso","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1015680681,"Input.title":"5 Chinese mine workers kidnapped in DR Congo","Input.publish_date":"2021-11-23 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>KINSHASA\/BEIJING\uff0dA group of unknown gunmen attacked a mining company located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and kidnapped five Chinese nationals early on Sunday.<\/p> <p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian confirmed the attack on Monday, saying the five Chinese nationals had been abducted in the country's east.<\/p> <p>During a daily news conference in Beijing, Zhao said the Chinese embassy in DR Congo is trying to rescue those who were kidnapped, and had launched an emergency response after the attack and relocated eight other Chinese workers to a safe place.<\/p> <p>Chinese citizens are advised not to go to high-risk areas for the time being and to evacuate these areas as soon as possible.

The question now is why?<\/p> <p>Among those currently in detention and allegedly tortured, are two MPs Muhammad Ssegirinya (Kawempe North) and Allan Sewanyana (Makindye West).<\/p> <p>But the two recent torture cases that have led Ugandans to fear the dark days of the regimes of then-presidents Idi Amin Dada (1971-79) and Milton Obote (1980-85) when soldiers and security agencies could pick up anyone, anywhere, at any time without explain and detain, toruture and kill many of them.<\/p> <p>On Feb.01, the biggest opposition political party in parliament; the National Unity Platform (NUP) paraded its coordinator for Kasese District, Samuel Masereka, to the media with wounds all over his body. They said the wounds resulted from torture he experienced while in military detection in Mbuya CMI headquarters in Kampala. Masereka who was being supported to walk had bodily injuries on legs and feet. His back was spread with bruises of canes.<\/p> <p>Masereka had been abducted from his home in Kasese on December 07, 2021. He said his abductors first took him to the Kasese Central Police station from where a \"drone\" omnibus van drove him at breakneck speed for two hours within Kasese town and later to Mbuya CMI headquarters. From Mbuya, Masereka said he was beaten in turns while being asked what NUP's plan for Rwenzori was. For the 34 days he was detained, Masereka said he was being beaten every day, asked the plans of NUP, their source of funds, and threatened that he could be killed without trace.<\/p> <p>In another case, a video circulating on social media sites shows an undressed Kakwenza Rukirabashaija; the internationally recognised writer of fiction, displaying alleged marks of torture he says he suffered in detention recently. The video showed Kakwenza's bum, back, and thighs; all with scars that have recently healed. Those scars according to Kakwenza were inflicted on him through beatings while in military detention. Kakwenza says the bruises and scars are a result of beating meted out on him by his captors; a section of Uganda's security forces.<\/p> <p>Kakwenza was violently arrested in Kisasi, Kampala, held for weeks in unknown place where neither his family member nor his lawyer could be allowed to see him. He was later to briefly appear at his Iganga home where it was discovered he had been subjected to torture.<\/p> <p>From Iganga, Kakwenza was again held incommunicado. Later on, he was arraigned in court and charged with offensive communication under the Computer Misuse Act in which he was accused of abusing President Yoweri Museveni and his son, Lt. Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba. While in Kitalya mini maximum prison, a medical officer counted over 60 freshly cut wounds on Kakwenza's body resulting from beatings he experienced while incommunicado arrest.<\/p> <p>Ruling party silent<\/p> <p>Torture is prohibited under international law. Ugandan law also protects the right to freedom from torture. Article 24 of the 1995 Constitution of Uganda states: \"No person shall be subjected to any form of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" To supplement this article of the Constitution, torture is also criminalised by the Prevention and Prohibition of Torture Act (2012).<\/p> <p>In spite of the available legal framework and the human rights laws, Uganda's security forces continue to torture suspects with impunity. The recent case of Kasese NUP coordinator, Kakwenza and others who have been subjected to torture show that holding individual security personnel who torture citizens accountable is still an uphill task as these are shielded by the regime.<\/p> <p>As a protest repeated acts of torture and human rights violations in the country, the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Parliament led a walk out of opposition legislators on February 3.<\/p> <p>The LoP, Mathias Mpuuga, said the opposition will boycott parliament sittings for two weeks.<\/p> <p>The Deputy Speaker Anita Among, said the appropriate solution would be for the LoP to come with a motion that seeks to debate and address the issue of torture. The deputy speaker reiterated that earlier on parliament had given Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja two weeks to brief the House on allegations of torture. The two weeks will end on 8 February.<\/p> <p>After the session, the Minister of ICT and National Guidance, Dr Chris Baryomnsi said the ruling government does not condone torture.<\/p> <p>\"If any suspect or person is tortured in an established prison, the security officers of that institution should be held accountable for their actions,\" Baryomunsi said.<\/p> <p>But allegations of torture in parliament are not new. On May 23, 2017, Kasilo County MP Elijah Okupa (FDC) made the following motion in parliament (in part): The third issue I want to raise is on Makindye Military Barracks. That is another place where torture has infiltrated and been meted on Ugandans. Honourable minister, we would like to know what is happening there. The committee should also interest itself in that place and go there.<\/p> <p>\"I am a victim of torture. I went through what Members are talking about here in 1988. Hon. Gutomoi has also been a victim. Hon. Mayende Dede, from your side, went through the same situation of torture one time. The honourable Dr Chris Baryomunsi knows what he went through and how I was protected in Jinja Police Station by fellow inmates. They said, \"This is what happens here\". When we were commissioners, you know what happened.\"<\/p> <p>On August 14, 2021 President Yoweri Museveni addressed the nation on the issue of security force personnel that torture suspects. In a televised address, Museveni spoke tough against torturing suspects. He said officers who use torture to obtain information are \"lazy\". He warned security forces against barking at or beating suspects, detaining suspects for long periods in jail and deporting foreigners without trial, saying it disadvantages the country.<\/p> <p>To illustrate his point, in that address, the President asked for videos to be played of suspects arrested in the trial of the attempted assassination of former Chief of Defense Forces General Edward Katumba Wamala.<\/p> <p>One video showed a suspect sobbing in court, saying he was beaten with various canes, which made him say things he should not be saying. Others showed a man with raw torture wounds on his back, a tortured man limping out of court, and police officer running after a woman and beating her repeatedly. Museveni said these were acts by individual officers and the failure of senior commanders.<\/p> <p>\"Beating captives [suspects] is wrong. Why? You undermine your case in court -- when the court discovered that you got information through torture. Secondly, on account of beating, somebody may admit what is not true. Torture, assassination, et cetera, are used by lazy people that are not ready to do more work using gaps in the stories of the criminals if they are telling lies,\" he said. Museveni promised to eliminate such torture.<\/p> <p>Two days after the Presidential address against torture, the Inspector General of Police, Martins Okoth Ochola, issued a statement saying he had tasked the police's Directorate of Human Rights and Legal Services to list all accused police officers for prosecution.<\/p> <p>\"There is no justification whatsoever under any circumstances or orders from a superior officer or public authority for torture,\" he said in a statement issued on August 16, 2021.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Uganda Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Suspects continue to complain of being tortured while in detention. The police force has normalised beating up journalists whenever they want to hide human rights violations.<\/p> <p>Several human rights reports, including some by the government's Uganda Human Rights Commission, have ranked Uganda's security forces including the police and Uganda Peoples Defence Force (UPDF) as the lead perpetrators of human rights violations particularly torture and cruel, inhuman degrading treatment or punishment.<\/p> <p>Human rights activists now say President Museveni's condemnation of torture allegedly committed by police and the armed forces was \"cosmetic\". They want to see action taken on perpetrators of torture.<\/p> <p>Livingston Sewanyana, Executive Director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, said: \"There's still a class of people who are increasingly being untouchable, and the President needs them for his political survival. So, much as he comes out as strong, with warnings, he definitely does not live up to his words. And the way politics is played here, it is all about who has the president's ear.\"<\/p> <p>Samuel Nsubuga, CEO of the non-government organization the African Center for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, says the president needs to act.<\/p> <p>\"I would like those people who did that to the suspects to be prosecuted in the courts of law. There's that gap which we really want the justice institutions to fill,\" Nsubuga said.<\/p> <p>Political activist and former FDC president, Dr. Kizza Besigye said the goal of torture is to scare Ugandans from demanding for a free and fair society.<\/p> <p>\"The people's desire for freedom and fulfilment is far great than the terror any tyrant can project. The pictures of the Museveni junta's recent torture victims like writer Kakwenza Rukirabashaija and Kasese District NUP Coordinator Samuel Masereka. These only prove the barbarism. That's why we have the red card campaign to end such acts of torture,\" Besigye said.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3KTCJ4SCVIGT5RFW34EJXTF2SI8M1L"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":766,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["torture"],"year":"1971","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Uganda","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, political prisoners, torture, ungazetted dungeons, forced confessions","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Elijah Okupa","victim_keywords":"potilitcian, PM, tortured","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hon.

Hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis took to the Pearl Roundabout to demand political reform on 14 February 2011. The turnout was proportionally one of the greatest shows of \"people power\" in modern history, and was brutally repressed by Bahraini authorities.<\/p> <p>Despite hollow promises for political reform, most of the demands for greater democratic reform by protesters remain unmet 10 years on. If anything, repression has gotten worse. The election of Joe Biden brings some hope of a hiatus, rather than a substantive change, but Bahrain remains at the mercy of a ruthless government backed by allies willing to turn a blind eye.<\/p> <p>Foreign affairs dictate repression<\/p> <p>Repression in Bahrain is intimately tied to foreign policy. Bahrain has always been dependent on foreign powers for protection, whether Britain, Saudi Arabia or the US. British diplomat Roger Tomkys said in 1982, \"Revolution in Bahrain will never be possible so long as the Kingdom of Saudi remains intact.\"<\/p> <p>Britain, Bahrain's former imperial suzerain, has continued to support repression in Bahrain<\/p> <p>In many ways, this was true, in 2011 the arrival across the Causeway of mostly Saudi troops from the Gulf Peninsula Shield force was the death knell for the Bahrain uprising. Dozens of Bahrainis were killed through torture or police violence, with hundreds put in prison following military trials.<\/p> <p>But it's not just Saudi Arabia. Britain, Bahrain's former imperial suzerain, has continued to support repression in Bahrain under the pretext of reforming its police. Most recently, the University of Huddersfield came under fire after opposition activists complained they were tortured on its Bahrain premises by the very police being trained by the UK.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, the US administration determines who lives and who dies in Bahrain. Since 2011, the Bahrain authorities have issued several death sentences in court cases widely criticised for violations of due process and procedure. Under Obama, the Bahrain government paid lip service to human rights reforms and did not execute anyone sentenced to death, for fear of riling the Obama administration. But the election of Trump changed everything.<\/p> <p>His administration's maximum pressure campaign on Iran meant Bahrain's government had the green light to do as they pleased with anyone they accused of acting in collusion with Iran - which was basically any opposition member.<\/p> <p>Bahrain executed three men in January 2017, the month of Trump's inauguration. Another eight Bahrainis were shot and killed before June 2017, marking the deadliest year since 2011. A further three were executed in 2019.<\/p> <p>Read more: Social media fuelled the Arab Spring, then helped dictators quash it<\/p> <p>As well as brute force, the Al Khalifa ruling family has long played with and manipulated the social fabric of Bahrain. By aggravating sectarian tensions through rhetoric and the destruction of Shia religious structures, it has attempted to divide a broad based opposition coalition by fanning the flames of religious acrimony.<\/p> <p>Legal and political avenues for participatory democracy have also narrowed in the past 10 years. The government has closed the country's largest political party Al Wefaq, and clamped down on independent media such as the newspaper Al Wasat.<\/p> <p>Hundreds of political prisoners swept up under the broad pretext of national security languish in jail. The Ministry of the Interior even announced that following someone on social media deemed anti-government could result in a jail sentence.<\/p> <p>A new hope?<\/p> <p>The past year brought a false dawn. The world's longest serving and hawkish prime minister Khalifa bin Salman died in November 2020, prompting hope that his successor, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, would usher in a new era of reforms.<\/p> <p>After all, it's not uncommon in Bahrain for the death of a key political figurehead to bring about change. The same happened in Bahrain in 1999, when Sheikh isa bin Salman Al Khalifa died. His son, Hamad, made himself King but also promised a new period of political liberalisation in the form of the national charter - when actually it was a constitutional coup.<\/p> <p>The arrival of mostly Saudi troops was the death knell for the Bahrain uprising<\/p> <p>While many expected an elected unilateral parliament, they got a bicameral system with an upper house appointed by the king. The Al Khalifa remained firmly in charge.<\/p> <p>The brief period of political liberalisation that allowed the formation of political parties did not stop continued corruption, problems with housing allocation, and economic troubles. These problems, which underscored the 2011 uprising, have not gone away.<\/p> <p>As it stands, the limits of political liberalisation have been reached in Bahrain. While the election of US President Joe Biden might put the brakes on the more egregious excesses of repression, the regime, ever deferential to its increasingly autocratic allies in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has little incentive to enact top-down change.<\/p> <p>Marc Owen Jones is an assistant professor in Middle East studies and digital humanities at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Doha, and an honorary research fellow at Exeter University.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"379OL9DBSUTBOD75QKHN6UKSZ4AY9W"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":387,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","torture"],"year":"2011","month":"February","date":"14.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Bahrain","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protesters, Pearl Roundabout, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"executed by the state, 2017, 2019","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"social media, activists, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","torture"],"year":"2011","month":"February","date":"14.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Bahrain","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protesters, Pearl Roundabout, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"executed by the state, 2017, 2019","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"social media, activists, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":960369873,"Input.title":"Trump inflames Western Sahara conflict by validating Morocco\u2019s occupation","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-17 10:49:32-06:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>A Sahrawi boy walks in the Smara refugee camp near Tindouf, south-western Algeria, March 4, 2016. The boy and his family are refugees from the ongoing Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara. | Toufik Doudou \/ AP<\/p> <p>Last week\u2019s announcement that Morocco and Israel will establish diplomatic relations has reignited global attention on the freedom struggle of the Sahrawi people of Western Sahara.<\/p> <p>The Polisario Front, the national liberation movement of the Sahrawi, has been fighting for independence since 1975 when Western Sahara was invaded and occupied by Morocco. The organization\u2019s name is based on the Spanish acronym for Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and R\u00edo de Oro, two of the regions that comprise Western Sahara.<\/p> <p>In a deal orchestrated by the Trump administration, the United States will recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in return for Morocco\u2019s embrace of Israel. The pact reportedly also includes the sale of American weapons and drones to Morocco as well as $3 billion in commercial investments in the North African kingdom.<\/p> <p>As usual, Trump disclosed the agreement in a tweet punctuated with random capitalization and exaggerated adjectives. And, once again, Trump\u2019s deal positions the United States as a rogue nation that undermines international consensus and disregards human rights.<\/p> <p>The United Nations recognizes Western Sahara as a \u201cnon-self-governing territory\u201d and the Polisario Front as the genuine representative of its people. A 1979 UN resolution affirmed the Sahrawis\u2019 right to self-determination and independence. Today, dozens of nations around the world acknowledge the Sahrawi Democratic Arab Republic, established by the Polisario Front in 1976, as the legitimate government of Western Sahara, and since 1984, it has been a member of the African Union (then known as the Organization of African Unity).<\/p> <p>Oubi Bouchraya Bachi, spokesperson for the Polisario Front, condemned the Moroccan-Israeli agreement, declaring to the BBC Focus of Africa program: \u201cSovereignty over Western Sahara is a decision that should be taken exclusively by the Sahrawi people.\u201d<\/p> <p>Formerly colonized by Spain, Western Sahara\u2019s annexation by Morocco began in 1975, as the Sahrawi proclaimed independence. A 16-year war between the Polisario Front and Morocco ended in 1991 with a ceasefire agreement that included plans for a referendum on independence in Western Sahara.<\/p> <p>To this day, the referendum has not been held, despite numerous UN-mediated negotiations, partly due to disagreements over who is eligible to vote. Since the 1970s, Morocco has encouraged its citizens to move to Western Sahara and argues these settlers should be eligible to participate in the vote. The Polisario Front rightly insists a referendum on independence should be decided by the Sahrawis only.<\/p> <p>In 2007, the Moroccan government offered Western Sahara a limited degree of autonomy under Moroccan rule, another desperate effort to deny self-determination to the Sahrawis which was rejected by the Polisario Front. Morocco\u2019s ploy was reminiscent of France\u2019s proposal to West Africans in the late 1950s to accept semi-autonomy within a French-dominated union rather than immediate and complete independence.<\/p> <p>Today, a nearly 1,700 mile-long fortified sand wall separates Western Sahara into a Moroccan-controlled west, which includes the entire 500-mile-long Atlantic coast, and a Polisario Front-ruled east, bordering Algeria and Mauritania.<\/p> <p>Last month, Morocco violated the 30-year ceasefire by sending troops into a demilitarized, UN-monitored buffer zone along Western Sahara\u2019s southern border with Mauritania. Morocco claims Polisario Front activists were blocking a key highway that links the occupied territory with the rest of the African continent. Faced with this military incursion and decades of obstructing the referendum, the Polisario Front announced the resumption of armed struggle.<\/p> <p>According to the Financial Times, the Polisario Front\u2019s representative at the United Nations, Sidi Omar, explained: \u201cWe did not want this war but Morocco has been emboldened by the inaction of the international community.\u201d In the last few weeks, skirmishes between Polisario Front soldiers and Moroccan troops have been reported. Human rights groups have also documented arrests of peaceful, pro-independence protesters in Western Sahara by Moroccan occupation authorities.<\/p> <p>The Trump administration\u2019s reckless decision to recognize Morocco\u2019s claims to Western Sahara threatens to further destabilize a region that has been in turmoil since the NATO bombardment of Libya in 2011. Following the murder of Muammar Gaddafi in October of that year, Libya has been devastated by a brutal war, and much of the Sahelian zone of West Africa, particularly the nations of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria, has been terrorized by various Islamist groups.<\/p> <p>Trump\u2019s deal also risks antagonizing Algeria, one of Africa\u2019s major political and military powers and a key partner in the multinational alliance battling those terror groups in West Africa. In response to the Moroccan-Israeli agreement, Algeria\u2019s Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad stated: \u201cThere are foreign maneuvers which aim to destabilize Algeria.\u201d<\/p> <p>Algeria has long been a steadfast supporter of the Sahrawi struggle for independence and the foremost backer of the Polisario Front. About 180,000 Sahrawis live in refugee camps in the desert along the southwestern Algerian border with Western Sahara where the government-in-exile of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is based. Like Palestinian refugees in the nations surrounding Israel, the Sahrawis cling to the hope for a return to their homeland.<\/p> <p>Western Sahara is about the size of the United Kingdom, and its population is estimated at 600,000. The two-thirds controlled by Morocco includes the capital of Laayoune, where about a third of the population of Western Sahara resides. As an occupying power, Morocco exploits the wealth of Western Sahara, notably its significant reserves of phosphates as well as the rich fisheries off its Atlantic coast. In recent years, underwater oil and gas fields have been discovered along various portions of the West African coastline, and exploration has been conducted offshore Western Sahara, as well.<\/p> <p>Just like Israel, which builds Jewish settlements in areas of the West Bank that are designated as part of a future independent Palestine state, the Moroccan government continues to encourage Moroccans to settle in Western Sahara. The Moroccan and Israeli settlement schemes are deemed illegal by most of the international community. In both cases, the objectives are clear: to alter the demographic balance in favor of the occupiers and to prevent the implementation of agreements leading to independence. By recognizing Israel\u2019s designation of Jerusalem as its capital in December 2017 and Morocco\u2019s claims to Western Sahara last week, the Trump administration condones the forced seizure and continued occupation of disputed territory in violation of international law.<\/p> <p>Morocco is the latest majority-Arab nation in recent months to break tradition by establishing diplomatic relations with Israel in exchange for financial and military inducements from the Trump administration. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates were the first this summer but the deal brokered with Sudan in October has been opposed by the vast majority of Sudanese who resolutely support the Palestinian struggle, as well as some members of the United States Congress who disagree with terms they consider overly favorable to Sudan.<\/p> <p>Some observers have noted the establishment of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel merely makes official links that have long existed as an open secret, as they cooperate in military and intelligence matters. The two nations also maintained liaison offices in Rabat and Tel Aviv until 2000, when they were closed by the Moroccan government at the start of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Israeli tourists are already permitted to travel to Morocco, where they are granted a visa upon arrival from third countries. About 50,000 Israelis visit Morocco annually, drawn to the nation\u2019s Jewish history and culture. The 3,000 Jews who live in Morocco today make it the largest Jewish community in North Africa. The agreement brokered by the Trump administration will facilitate direct flights from Israel to Morocco.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, opposition to ties with Israel and solidarity with Palestine is nearly universal in Morocco. Though they are united in supporting their nation\u2019s occupation of Western Sahara, several parties within Morocco\u2019s ruling coalition government as well as in its opposition have denounced the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel.

(AP Photo\/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez)<\/p> <p>JFK8\u2019s workers voted in the ALU with 2,654 \u201cyes\u201d votes to 2,131 \u201cno\u201d votes, or a margin of close to 10 percentage points, in an election which drew out more than half of the warehouse\u2019s eligible voters. Another ALU election is planned for April 25 at the LDJ5 warehouse on Staten Island, which employs roughly 1,600 workers.<\/p> <p>The ALU\u2019s victory came a day after results were announced for a similar union election at Amazon held in Bessemer, Alabama. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) is losing the vote at the BHM1 fulfillment center, where it received only 875 \u201cyes\u201d votes to 993 \u201cno\u201d votes. Several hundred contested ballots are currently being litigated, and the result will be announced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) within the next few weeks.<\/p> <p>The highly depressed turnout (only 39 percent) for the Alabama vote came despite glowing media coverage and high-profile political support from Biden and other Democrats. Biden\u2019s NLRB allowed the RWDSU to re-run the election after an initial attempt failed.<\/p> <p>The larger turnout at the JFK8 facility may be attributed to the fact that the ALU has promoted itself as an independent union, run by current and former Amazon workers. Christian Smalls, the ALU\u2019s leader, is a former JFK8 worker who was fired in 2020 after he and several co-workers organized a walkout in protest of Amazon\u2019s lackluster COVID-19 protections.<\/p> <p>In another difference from the RWDSU campaign, the ALU raised a specific set of demands of the company, including raises to $30 an hour, more vacation days and paid time off as well as an increase in break times during shifts. Numerous investigations have revealed the widespread occurrence of workers injuring themselves in Amazon\u2019s vast warehouses as well as foregoing rest times and bathroom breaks in order to make obscenely high \u201crates.\u201d<\/p> <p>A New York Times investigation of the JFK8 warehouse last year determined that the corporation tracked \u201cevery minute of most warehouse workers\u2019 shifts, from how fast they packed merchandise to how long they paused\u2026 If productivity flagged, Amazon\u2019s computers assumed the worker was to blame.\u201d<\/p> <p>No doubt, many workers voting for the ALU did so out of a desire to improve their conditions and carry out a fight against the corporation and its multi-billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos.<\/p> <p>Such a fight, however, requires the mobilization of the working class independently of the corporatist trade unions, which are heavily promoted by sections of the ruling class, particularly the Democratic Party, as critical instruments for the suppression of the class struggle. This requires the development of a network of rank-and-file committees, democratically controlled by the workers themselves.<\/p> <p>While the ALU claims to be independent, its orientation is in fact to the trade union apparatus, a section of which sees in such initiatives (at Amazon, Starbucks and other companies) a method to somehow revive support for thoroughly discredited organizations.<\/p> <p>Tellingly, Democratic Party-connected media outlets have heaped praise on Smalls and the ALU. As it has throughout the entire Amazon unionization campaign, the Times led the way, declaring the JFK8 vote \u201ca stunning win\u201d and \u201cone of the biggest victories for organized labor in a generation.\u201d The Democratic Socialists of America-aligned Jacobin magazine, which sees as its principal role the strengthening of the trade union apparatus, called it a \u201cDavid-and-Goliath\u2026 fight between the independent union and one of the world\u2019s most powerful companies.\u201d<\/p> <p>There are already numerous signs that Smalls and the ALU are open to an approach from the RWDSU or other pro-corporate organizations. Speaking to NPR about the RWDSU, Smalls declared \u201cI hope they\u2019re successful\u2026 We know we show our support and solidarity with them.\u201d The RWDSU\u2019s president Stuart Appelbaum, a longtime Democratic Party and state operative, has offered to \u201csupport them [the ALU] and not look for anything in return\u201d if \u201cChris runs out of money.\u201d<\/p> <p>During the campaign for unionization at JFK, the ALU borrowed office space from the Unite Here, an organization (with $150 million in assets) that has played a critical role in isolating and defeating the struggles of service workers\u2014and keeping them on the job during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that in the aftermath of its victory at Amazon, the fledgling ALU will have more than just office space offered to it.

(Greg Baker\/AFP via Getty Images)<\/p> <p>UN Body Collaborating With CCP Agency Known for Human Rights Violations: Rights Group<\/p> <p>A United Nations body set up to combat drugs and corruption is being questioned for having entered into an agreement with a Chinese extrajudicial agency known for its human rights violations.<\/p> <p>On June 29, Madrid-based human rights group Safeguard Defenders announced a new investigation into China\u2019s secretive detention system known as \u201cliuzhi,\u201d as well as the submission of its investigative findings (pdf) to the U.N. Special Procedures, which consists of special rapporteurs and expert working groups.<\/p> <p>The rights group calls the liuzhi system a \u201clegalized system for disappearance.\u201d<\/p> <p>The rights group\u2019s concerns center around the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) choosing to work with the Chinese agency behind the liuzhi system, the National Supervision Commission (NSC). The two signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in October 2019.<\/p> <p>Since then, the NSC has subjected at least 28,983 victims to the liuzhi system, according to estimates by the rights group. During that same time span, the Chinese regime has only confirmed to have placed 5,909 people under the system.<\/p> <p>The rights group also estimated that a minimum average of 16 to 76 people is subjected to the liuzhi system every day.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe NSC is responsible for widespread and systematic acts of enforced disappearance, torture, and other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health, gross human rights violations that have all been reported to the United Nations,\u201d the rights group stated.<\/p> <p>There are limited details of the agreement, except that the two sides would work in areas including information sharing on corruption prevention and fugitive repatriation. As a result, Safeguard Defenders stated that it has asked the UNODC to release the full contents of the MOU, but its request has been denied.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf 28,983 people [arbitrarily] detained, disappeared and [tortured] since signing the MOU is not enough for the UNODC to realize NSC is not a suitable partner, let alone develop deeper cooperation with, [what would be]?\u201d Safeguard Defenders asked.<\/p> <p>The NSC, a non-judicial organ, is a supersized anti-corruption agency established by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in March 2018. It\u2019s tasked with investigating economic crimes committed by business people, party members, and employees at state-run institutions.<\/p> <p>The NSC holds enormous power, including the ability to issue warrants, freeze assets, summon suspects, and hold suspects for at least six months in the liuzhi system, where they\u2019re denied access to their family or a lawyer.<\/p> <p>Laura Harth, campaign director for Safeguard Defenders, said that U.N. agencies are all \u201cbound to the fundamental human rights contained in the human rights treaties and conventions,\u201d which prohibits arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, tortures, and absence of access to legal representation.<\/p> <p>\u201cYet, in signing an MOU and recognizing the extrajudicial body NSC as the legitimate representative of the Chinese Government for the scope of the Convention Against Corruption, UNODC completely derogates from its obligations in this regard,\u201d Harth said in an email to The Epoch Times.<\/p> <p>She noted that suspects could be held under liuzhi for more than six months.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe sole purpose for the time inside\u2014up to six months\u2014is to produce a confession, and a suspect will likely remain for as long as needed to secure such a confession,\u201d Harth said.<\/p> <p>In May 2018, less than two months after the NSC was established, the first known death in the liuzhi system was reported. Citing China\u2019s state-run media Caixin, Safeguard Defenders reported that the dead man was Chen Yong, who was held in liuzhi for 26 days before his death. Chen was a driver for a local official who was a suspect in a corruption case.<\/p> <p>Chen\u2019s family saw his body, which was mangled and bruised, suggesting that he was \u201ctortured to death,\u201d according to the rights group (pdf).<\/p> <p>Another known detainee under the system was Meng Hongwei, former president of Interpol. He went missing after returning to China in September 2018, before the NSC released a statement confirming his detention the following month. In January 2020, Meng was sentenced to 13 years and six months in prison after he pleaded guilty to accepting more than $2 million in bribes.<\/p> <p>The MOU that the NSC signed with UNODC isn\u2019t the only one. According to the NSC\u2019s website, the commission also inked similar agreements with several countries, including Argentina, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt least for the NSC, signing of these MOU has effectively legitimized China\u2019s move of handing over judicial cooperation, and criminal investigations, to a non-judicial organ,\u201d Safeguard Defenders stated.<\/p> <p>Liuzhi isn\u2019t the only form of forced disappearance in China. The CCP also commits \u201cmass state-sanctioned kidnapping\u201d of its people and foreigners under a system called \u201cResidential Surveillance at a Designated Location\u201d (RSDL). This system is carried out by police officers from China\u2019s ministries of public security and state security.<\/p> <p>In August 2019, 27 human rights organizations, including Safeguard Defenders, World Uyghur Congress, and the International Campaign for Tibet, issued a joint statement calling on the Chinese regime to end all forms of forced disappearing, including RSDL and liuzhi.<\/p> <p>Safeguard Defenders has asked the U.N. Special Procedures to carry out a \u201ccomprehensive analysis\u201d of the liuzhi system and how it \u201cstands in line with international legal and human rights obligation.\u201d<\/p> <p>Harth called on UNODC to release the contents of the MOU. The U.N. agency should immediately cease any cooperation with the NSC that puts the Party organ as the \u201clegitimate representative\u201d of the Chinese regime, she said.<\/p> <p>UNDOC told The Epoch Times that it did not have any problems disclosing the MoU if NSC also agreed.<\/p> <p>\u201cAs any UN-entity and being an integrated part of the UN Secretariat, UNODC is bound to apply the standards set out in the UN human rights due diligence policy in whatever it undertakes, be it technical, normative and any other related work,\u201d UNDOC said in an email.<\/p> <p>Cathy He contributed to the article.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"302U8RURJ1GF9LGUMJD8HWBIMCPVNJ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":705,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","torture"],"year":"2018","month":"May","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"liuzhi system, forced disappearance, National Supervision Commission, CCP","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chen Yong","victim_keywords":"driver, liuzhi system, forced disappearance, CCP, National Supervision Commission, tortured, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Meng Hongwei","victim_keywords":"former head of INTERPOL, liuzhi system, forced disappearance, National Supervision Commission, CCP, tortured, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","torture"],"year":"2018","month":"May","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"liuzhi system, forced disappearance, National Supervision Commission, CCP","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chen Yong","victim_keywords":"driver, liuzhi system, forced disappearance, CCP, National Supervision Commission, tortured, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Meng Hongwei","victim_keywords":"former head of INTERPOL, liuzhi system, forced disappearance, National Supervision Commission, CCP, tortured, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":996152774,"Input.title":"Hong Kong police arrest 5 trade union members for sedition","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-21 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Hong Kong police on Thursday arrested five trade union members over children\u2019s books they described as seditious, and a court denied bail for four editors and journalists held on charges of endangering national security, as part of a widening crackdown on dissent in the city.<\/p> <p>The five who were arrested are members of the General Association of Hong Kong Speech Therapists, according to local media reports.<\/p> <p>The association published three children\u2019s books that Li Kwai-wah, a senior superintendent of the national security department, said have seditious intent.<\/p> <p>The books feature stories that revolve around a village of sheep that has to deal with wolves from a different village.

Within minutes of his post, Rukirabashaija was abducted by Uganda\u2019s Special Forces Command, a military outfit notorious for torturing nonviolent activists.<\/p> <p>Rukirabashaija \u2014 author of a political allegory novel and an autobiographical book detailing his previous torture \u2014 has only surfaced once since his brutal kidnapping. When his lawyer Eron Kiiza summoned Rukirabashaija\u2019s captors to present him in court, they violated the summons and brought their victim to his rural home in Iganga to search his home, much to the terror of his wife and children. Showering for the first time in eight days while armed men stood watching him, he removed his bloody clothes and boxers as men ransacked his house looking for \u201cevidence\u201d of the tweet he had posted. In a few short hours, Rukirabashaija was again whisked away to an undisclosed location.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, the court magistrate signed off on Kiiza\u2019s orders for Rukirabashaija to be produced in court. Special Forces Command refused to adhere to the court orders, a blatantly illegal act to which Rukirabashaija\u2019s spouse, Eva Basiima, responded with a lawsuit.<\/p> <p>A fragile dictator and his fragile son<\/p> <p>Nothing spells male fragility like torturing a writer for weeks on end due to a single tweet. Shortly before Rukirabashaija\u2019s abduction, he had been blasting government-bankrolled trolls on Twitter with his characteristically dense vocabulary. Eventually, he took a jab at General Muhoozi Kainerugaba \u2014 the son of dictator Yoweri Museveni \u2014 who is attempting to inherit the presidency from his brutal elderly father. \u201cMuhoozi has humongous hips and breasts,\u201d Rukirabashaija tweeted. \u201cHe\u2019s obese. How can a soldier who went to genuine military training and exercises everyday have such a sedentary figure? God punishes the corrupt in a good way with a badge of stupid figure.\u201d<\/p> <p>Before dismissing Rukirabashaija\u2019s tweet as reckless body-shaming, a little context may be useful. Soldiers in the Uganda People\u2019s Defense Forces are allegedly subjected to forced hunger and sleep deprivation during their training. They are famously in shape due to the demands of their work, coupled with their wretched living conditions. In Uganda, an overweight middle-aged man of a prestigious title is said to \u201ceat money.\u201d In other words, he is massively corrupt and uses money or other means of force to coerce those who work for him with impunity.<\/p> <p>According to one of Rukirabashaija\u2019s tweets the day before his abduction, \u201cNo one in their sense of mind can support such a plump moustached pachydermatous inebriated curmudgeon.\u201d (At risk of mispronouncing words he did not know, one police spokesperson refused to read these tweets in his statement to the press on the extrajudicial arrest of Rukirabashaija.)<\/p> <p>Stella Nyanzi with Kakwenza Rukirabashaija (Facebook\/Stella Nyanzi)<\/p> <p>Kainerugaba reacted to this tweet swiftly by wrangling his armed men to forcefully enter Rukirabashaija\u2019s home and whisk him away. The day after the abduction, Stella Nyanzi, a poet so vulgar that her Facebook posts have landed her in prison for years, published \u201cSex in Exchange for Kakwenza,\u201d a graphicly incendiary poem directed at Kainerugaba, putting his atrocities in the spotlight for her hundreds of thousands of followers.<\/p> <p>It is also worth noting that the very act of using social media to discuss matters of public concern \u2014 even when not directly attacking a member of the first family \u2014 is an act of civil disobedience by Ugandans. After placing a daily tax on social media use, Uganda\u2019s government placed an outright ban on Facebook, a platform used by many small business owners to earn a living. VPN downloads in Uganda have skyrocketed since the tax and the Facebook ban.<\/p> <p>Striking back against citizens circumventing the ban, Uganda\u2019s government greedily imposed an additional 12% internet tax, even while children across Uganda were subject to the world\u2019s longest school shutdown. Just as the most modest forms of peaceful dissent in Uganda are met with brute force, everyday use of the internet is also now effectively criminalized.<\/p> <p>State co-optation and a baby\u2019s arrest<\/p> <p>The timeline of these events overlap with another national scandal. On the first day of the new year, NBS Television reported that the Uganda Human Rights Commission, or UHRC, denounced criticism of Uganda\u2019s security agencies. UHRC boss Margaret Wangadya said that security agencies were being wrongly portrayed as leading human rights abusers. Public comments like these continue to reveal the co-optation of human rights institutions by the Museveni family.<\/p> <p>In response to Wangadya\u2019s remarks, the pressure group Friends of Kakwenza showed up to protest at the offices of UHRC, directly opposite the Uganda Police Force national headquarters. Activist Nana Mwafrika \u2014 who lost her uterus to police brutality and now walks with a cane \u2014 came to the offices with Rukirabashaija\u2019s two-year-old son. Moments after her arrival, security operatives fully clad in anti-riot gear invaded the premises and arrested both Mwafrika and the young boy, who had offered his toy trucks in exchange for his father. The duo was forced into a police van and released on bond later that day.<\/p> <p>The malfeasance of regime-captured human rights institutions like the UHRC illustrates an endemic challenge in Uganda. Even would-be allies caution the most modest forms of nonviolent action against Museveni\u2019s brutal regime and insist on taking reformist action through state-controlled \u201cproper channels.\u201d<\/p> <p>Unfortunately international bodies such as U.N. agencies and embassies are perhaps even worse than national human rights offices. Just as the U.N. deliberately suppressed media freedoms during a month-long 323-person occupation of one of their offices in northern Uganda, there is nothing but a loud silence on Rukirabashaija\u2019s torture from most of the foreign missions.<\/p> <p>A legacy of performative colonial courtesy<\/p> <p>Such cynical apathy and regulation of the means of resistance is inherited through colonial history. \u201cThe colonizers used politeness to control and subdue us,\u201d Nyanzi explained. \u201cThis is why radical rudeness emerged. It was in defiance of this passively courteous subjugation.\u201d<\/p> <p>Academic Carol Summers has explored how Ganda resistance to British diplomacy in the 1940s took the form of disorderliness, insults and other forms of rudeness. Nyanzi sees her academic work, poetry and activism as a kind of appropriation of this tradition. If the Museveni administration has accelerated colonial policies of domination, she has also inspired a new generation of writers and activists to take up their pens and gadgets and spew hellfire upon those who are most greedy and bloodthirsty.<\/p> <p>Support Us Waging Nonviolence depends on reader support. Become a sustaining monthly donor today! Donate<\/p> <p>This radical rudeness has emerged despite the fact that Ugandans are highly religious and extraordinarily polite, in one survey being named the world\u2019s friendliest people. But everyone has their limits, and for an increasing number of Ugandans, four decades of the same family in power is one such limit. Rukirabashaija and Nyanzi are not the only Ugandan writers to borrow a leaf from their vulgarly long-winded anti-colonial predecessors. Youth such as Ashaba Annah are honing their own courageous foul-mouthed power with lines like, \u201cI want to be Museveni\u2019s side chic.

But it seems to have invigorated Austin Smucker of Madras.<\/p> <p>\"I believed in prayer when I went down there,\" Smucker told the Madras Pioneer, sister publication to the Portland Tribune, \"but I believe in prayer more since I came back.\"<\/p> <p>Smucker, 27, a construction worker, went to Haiti in October with Christian Aid Ministries to rebuild homes after the August earthquake there. Before they even began, Smucker and 16 of his fellow missionaries, including three children, stepped into a bizarre trap that thrust them into the national spotlight, as people around the country fasted and prayed for their delivery.<\/p> <p>The abduction<\/p> <p>Returning from visiting an orphanage, the missionaries' van encountered a roadblock. The quick-thinking driver pulled a U-turn, only to be cutoff by gun-toting gangsters. Trapped, the driver was forced to follow the ringleader.<\/p> <p>When he didn't drive fast enough, \"They opened the driver's door and pulled Dale out,\" Smucker said. \"One of them slapped him across his face, grabbed him and took him to the vehicle behind us.<\/p> <p>\"We felt like we were never going to see him again. We didn't know where they were going to take him.\"<\/p> <p>One of the gang members took the driver's seat, speeding down the rocky dirt road. \"I think I spent more time with my hair plastered to the top of the van than I did with my rear on the seat I was supposed to be sitting on,\" Smucker said.<\/p> <p>The driver did rejoin the group, but Smucker said those first few days were disorienting.<\/p> <p>\"They wanted all our money and our phones. They told us they would kill us if we were hiding anything,\" Smucker said, \"but they were drunk or on drugs. So, I don't know if they meant that.\"<\/p> <p>The gang missed 1,500 Haitian gourds \u2014 worth about $15 in U.S. currency \u2014 tucked inside a diaper bag. That money became useful later.<\/p> <p>The kidnappers stuffed 17 hostages, including three children, in a 10 by 12 foot room and gave them a price tag. The captors asked Christian Aid Ministries for $1 million per head for a total of $17 million.<\/p> <p>The aid agency has a policy against paying ransoms.<\/p> <p>Captivity<\/p> <p>So the hostages waited. For two months.<\/p> <p>They had no idea people around the world prayed and fasted for them, Smucker said.<\/p> <p>As the fear eased off, the gangsters \"would cock the guns in front of us expecting to see us cower in fear. But we didn't because the worst they could do was shoot us and we'd go to heaven,\" he said.<\/p> <p>Smucker said he didn't believe their captors would kill them. \"They kept bringing us stuff that didn't make sense to bring us if they were planning to kill us later,\" he said, \"food and mattresses, couches, box fans wired to a generator so we'd have air going inside the room.\"<\/p> <p>The food wasn't great or plentiful: spaghetti in fish sauce for breakfast, rice and beans for dinner. They didn't starve, but Smucker lost 20 pounds in two months.<\/p> <p>The missionaries smuggled food to other captives in the next room. Those prisoners were bound hand and foot, and they weren't Americans. Smucker said he thinks his group may have gotten better treatment because they were Americans.<\/p> <p>The escape<\/p> <p>Throughout the experience, the topic of escape came up. Smucker said, at first, he was one of the most outspoken against escape, until one of his fellow captives convinced him God told him the time had come to leave.<\/p> <p>Smucker told the Madras Pioneer he wanted the group to rely solely on God for their safety. \"We'll open the door and just walk out in full plain site of the guards and just leave. And if God wants us to leave he'll blind their eyes and they won't see us,\" he said.<\/p> <p>The group had smuggled in a stick to shove away the stone and the post holding the door that blocked them in. Then the team lined up single file, and, with the guards just on the other side of the house, the group slipped across the yard and through a hedge that shielded them from view. It took them less than a minute.<\/p> <p>A spiritual journey<\/p> <p>The group left at 2:30 in the morning. Confident their guards would not notice their absence until daylight, the group figured they had three or four hours to establish a safe distance. A full moon lighted their way.<\/p> <p>With two children in tow (ages 10 months and 3 years) they embarked on a peculiar adventure with obstacles worthy of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" \u2014 a canal, which some jumped and most waded, only to find a bridge 500 yards downstream; a lake, which they had to walk around; a deep, dark forest of thorns, through which they bushwhacked for two hours, dodging two-inch spikes and jumping cacti; a cow path, which they took instead of the road to avoid discovery At each crossroads they circled and prayed to get God's direction.<\/p> <p>Sometime after sunrise they decided to be bold and ask for help. In the middle of gang territory they had no way of knowing who might help them, or who might turn them over to their captors.<\/p> <p>The first person they approached pointed to a home where someone had a phone.<\/p> <p>That person was willing, but had no minutes on the phone. The missionaries handed him Haitian money from their diaper bag stash, telling him, \"Buy yourself some minutes and keep the change.\"<\/p> <p>Finally, after two months in confinement, and 10 hours on foot, the group called the mission's Haiti field director. Moments later they were rescued.<\/p> <p>Smucker said saw a father who greeted them at the compound dance and yodel with joy to see his four captive children, whom he hadn't seen in 62 days . \"The reunion was absolutely amazing,\" Smucker said.<\/p> <p>The ransom<\/p> <p>While Smucker says Christian Aid Ministries stayed true to its policy to not pay ransoms to kidnappers, someone did pay a ransom. He says he doesn't know who, and he doesn't know how much. But Smucker understands that his group stayed imprisoned even after the agreed upon sum had been paid.<\/p> <p>The gang's leader is serving a life term in prison, and conversations with Smucker's guards led him to believe the gang used the missionary group as leverage to free their leader. The captives escaped before that happened. On two occasions, the gang released some of the original 17 hostages: first a married couple, he had a severe infection that could lead to death if left untreated; then two women and a child; the women had several infected sores over their skin. Smucker said he's uncertain if the guards released the suffering hostages for money or out of compassion.<\/p> <p>The kidnappers<\/p> <p>\"I don't have any feelings of anger toward the guards,\" Smucker said. \"To them, it's their job. It's how they make their money, by kidnapping people. And these guards had to keep us from escaping.\"<\/p> <p>This was not Smucker's first mission trip and it won't be his last, he said. If anything, the experience energized his enthusiasm.<\/p> <p>\"If Satan was attempting to scare me from ever wanting to go on another mission he was totally unsuccessful.\"<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3ACRLU860PTW615BO3JPQXN25S8EB7"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":338,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"October","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Haiti","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Austin Smucker","victim_keywords":"missionary, construction worker, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"missionaries, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"October","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Haiti","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Austin Smucker","victim_keywords":"missionary, construction worker, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"missionaries, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":923858230,"Input.title":"Ridgeland Correctional Institution lieutenant charged with trying to sexually assault co-worker","Input.publish_date":"2020-05-15 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>RIDGELAND, S.C.

They wrote to Britain\u2019s Conservative Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday, warning, \u201cMr. Assange could die\u201d because of years of arbitrary detention and his continued incarceration in almost permanent isolation in London\u2019s Belmarsh maximum security prison.<\/p> <p>The doctors insist that Assange be moved to a university teaching hospital, where he can be assessed and treated by an expert medical team. They stress, \u201cThe medical situation is thereby urgent. There is no time to lose.\u201d<\/p> <p>Julian Assange<\/p> <p>We urge workers, young people and all those concerned with democratic rights to heed the doctors\u2019 warning and join the fight to defend Julian Assange as well as the courageous whistle-blower Chelsea Manning, who has also been locked away for refusing to give false testimony against Assange.<\/p> <p>The doctors\u2019 initiative marks a new stage in the struggle to free Assange because it has been taken independently by a group of professional workers, animated by profound concern for his fate and for democratic rights.<\/p> <p>The doctors were acutely concerned by the findings of Nils Melzer, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, that Assange is suffering the effects of prolonged \u201cpsychological torture\u201d after nearly a decade of arbitrary detention and state persecution, which \u201cmay soon end up costing his life.\u201d They saw how this warning by the world\u2019s foremost authority on torture was simply dismissed by the UK government.<\/p> <p>Following the harrowing account of Assange\u2019s physical and mental condition given by former British diplomat and whistle-blower Craig Murray, who attended the October 21 Westminster Magistrates Court hearing at which Assange appeared, the doctors decided to act. They resolved that it was their professional duty to report \u201csuspected torture of which they become aware, wherever it may be occurring\u2026 That professional duty is absolute and must be carried out regardless of risk to reporting doctors.\u201d<\/p> <p>The brave and independent action of the doctors has inspired many others, evoking a powerful global response and forcing the world\u2019s media to report on the letter. Other doctors are now coming forward to append their own signature.<\/p> <p>The open letter has revealed the massive but latent support for Assange that can and must be mobilised in his defence. The central issue is how this must be done.<\/p> <p>On June 20, the editorial board of the World Socialist Web Site issued a statement, \u201cFor a worldwide campaign to prevent Julian Assange\u2019s rendition to the US!\u201d The statement stated: \u201cThe movement to secure Julian Assange\u2019s freedom must come from below. Moral appeals to the governments that are persecuting him are less than useless. Assange\u2019s freedom must be fought for independently of, and in opposition to, the political agents of the ruling class.\u201d<\/p> <p>This position has been fully vindicated by the open letter.<\/p> <p>The doctors\u2019 stand was taken in defiance of a vindictive gang-up against Assange involving the state machinery and governments of the United States, the UK, Australia, Sweden and Ecuador to punish him for exposing war crimes in Afghanistan and elsewhere and then silence him forever.<\/p> <p>Dr Stephen Frost, a specialist in diagnostic radiology, wrote of the open letter: \u201cIf the UK government does not heed doctors\u2019 warnings and continues with its current reckless, dangerous and cruel behaviour, people from all over the world will rightly call for those responsible to be held to account. We say that the situation is medically urgent and that it must not be allowed to continue. There is no time to lose. The torture must stop NOW.\u201d<\/p> <p>In response, the UK government has again made clear that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of the plans to stage a show trial next February before carrying out a predetermined decision to extradite Assange to the US. Patel\u2019s Home Office issued a statement to the media yesterday declaring, \u201cThe allegations Mr. Assange was subjected to torture are unfounded and wholly false. The UK is committed to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that no one is ever above it.\u201d<\/p> <p>The open letter cuts across the toxic mixture of personal and political slanders employed by the liberal media, social democratic parties, including Britain\u2019s Labour Party, trade unions, civil rights organisations, right-wing feminists and various pseudo-left groups to justify their refusal to defend Assange.<\/p> <p>The letter was issued at the height of Britain\u2019s general election campaign. It was sent to Labour\u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott. But she has refused to issue any statement whatsoever. Neither Abbott nor Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has once mentioned the world\u2019s most famous political prisoner during the course of the campaign\u2014a man incarcerated less than 12 miles from the Houses of Parliament. His name doesn\u2019t appear in Labour\u2019s manifesto, even when it pledges to protect \u201cwhistle-blowers\u201d and bring in \u201ca legal right of public interest defence for journalists.\u201d<\/p> <p>Corbyn has tried to justify his refusal to defend Assange by citing the bogus sexual allegations made by two women in a case that was dropped for the second time in 2017. In April, he declared that if the case was \u201creinstated,\u201d then Assange \u201cmust answer those questions and those demands about the accusations made against him.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Swedish investigation was dropped last week, after nine years in which no charges were ever brought. But neither this, nor the intervention by over 60 doctors, will prompt Corbyn to act in defiance of the state conspiracy against Assange.<\/p> <p>For the ruling class, the persecution of Assange is the spearhead of a massive assault on democratic rights, aimed at destroying freedom of speech, illegalizing investigative journalism, intimidating and terrorizing critics, preventing the exposure of government crimes and suppressing popular opposition to social inequality and war.<\/p> <p>The World Socialist Web Site insists that only the working class, the world\u2019s most powerful social force, has the necessary strength to oppose this and that it must do so independently of the old parties and trade unions.<\/p> <p>Just as the capitalist class is using the persecution of Assange as the linchpin of its plans for dictatorship, so the working class must make his defence the focal point for a counteroffensive against militarism and all attacks on democratic and social rights.<\/p> <p>Already there is a rising tide of international class struggle, strikes and mass protests against social inequality and corrupt government, which provides the powerful mass foundation for the struggle for Assange\u2019s freedom.<\/p> <p>The defence of Assange must be guided by a global strategy that consciously links the fight to defend democratic rights to the growing social struggle of the international working class against capitalist exploitation and political oppression. The Socialist Equality Parties, sections of the International Committee of the Fourth International, call on all those who fear for Assange\u2019s life and want to see a heroic and innocent man freed to join this vital struggle.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"38VTL6WC4CSSNQ5TNU46UEFQD8RY55"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":3457,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"WikiLeaks, founder","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chelsea Manning","victim_keywords":"refusing false testimony, Assange","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"WikiLeaks, founder","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chelsea Manning","victim_keywords":"refusing false testimony, Assange","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":939845240,"Input.title":"Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested under security law, bearing out 'worst fears'","Input.publish_date":"2020-08-10 00:23:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai became the highest-profile person arrested under a new national security law on Monday, detained over suspected collusion with foreign forces as around 200 police searched the offices of his Apple Daily newspaper.<\/p> <p>Mainland-born Lai, who was smuggled into the British colony of Hong Kong on a fishing boat when he was a penniless 12-year-old, has been one of the most prominent democracy activists in the now Chinese-ruled city and an ardent critic of Beijing.<\/p> <p>His arrest comes amid Beijing\u2019s crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in the city and further stokes concerns about media and other promised freedoms when it returned to China in 1997.

According to all three contacts, the government wanted to prosecute him under a law criminalising certain types of communication with inmates.<\/p> <p>Soyombo pulled out of a public event he had travelled to Lagos for, and went into hiding.<\/p> <p>Had he been detained, Soyombo would have been the latest victim of a crackdown on the media and freedom of speech this year in Nigeria, which is 12th out of 13 on the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Impunity Index, a ranking of countries with the worst records of unsolved murders of journalists.<\/p> <p>Soyombo said he received a lot of support on social media in the days after he went into hiding, and that the plan to arrest him has seemingly been dropped. The Nigerian correctional service eventually released a statement saying work could be done to clean up the system, and that it had \u201cno intention of arresting or harassing\u201d Soyombo.<\/p> <p>At least three journalists are currently detained in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Omoyele Sowore, an activist and founder of the New York-based online news agency Sahara Reporters, was taken by secret police from a hotel room in Lagos in August. Sowore, who stood as a candidate in February\u2019s presidential elections and usually lives in the US, has been charged with treason, cyberstalking and money laundering for allegedly sharing false and insulting information about the president, Muhammadu Buhari.<\/p> <p>Despite being granted bail earlier this month his lawyers said they were denied access to him, and he remains in detention and is currently on hunger strike.<\/p> <p>Jones Abiri, the publisher and editor-in-chief of the Weekly Source newspaper, was arrested in May and charged with cybercrime, sabotage and terrorism. The case related to 2016 allegations of links to rebels in the Niger Delta, after which he was detained by Nigeria\u2019s intelligence agency for two years without trial.<\/p> <p>In the southern state of Cross River, Agba Jalingo, who publishes the Cross River Watch paper, was arrested in August, days after the publication of an article about alleged corruption. Jalingo has been charged with treason and a bail request has been declined.<\/p> <p>Return to the dark days<\/p> <p>Human rights activists and civil society groups say that the muzzling of the press under Buhari has raised the spectre of a return to the dark days of military rule in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Buhari, a former army general who has been president since 2015, was also Nigeria\u2019s head of state in the mid-1980s, when he took power in a military coup. At the time he introduced the draconian Public Officers (Protection Against False Accusation) law, better known as Decree 4. The law targeted the press, criminalising the publication of information deemed injurious to the junta.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese (recent) incidents suggest a disturbing trend towards repression of freedom of expression and create a climate of fear which may stifle the media,\u201d said Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThrowing reporters in jail for doing their job of informing the public sends a chilling message to journalists, activists and citizens.\u201d<\/p> <p>Soyombo said gagging the press was a misuse of power. \u201cIt is an irony that a president and state governors who ascended to power via the polls can suddenly not tolerate dissent,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, in an article titled \u201cShort walk to totalitarianism?\u201d, Matthew Hassan Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, criticises the controversial Social Media and Hate Speech Bills. Excerpts:<\/p> <p>Democracy thrives on debate, consensus building, negotiation, persuasion, argumentation, rule of law, process, and inclusion. The military thrives in a coup culture, secrecy, betrayal, violence, command structure, exclusion and lack of transparency. That explains why I have always warned against describing the current charade of violent elections as democracy\u2026<\/p> <p>\u2026The recent outrage by the Minister of Information, Mr. Lai Mohammed, over public reaction to the Social Media Bill, is illustrative of the point I am making, namely, that not all who call themselves democrats appreciate the enormous burden that goes with the claim today\u2026The Minister says that no amount of threat, blackmail, etc., will dissuade the government from going ahead with the social media because it is borne out of patriotism. Really?..<\/p> <p>\u2026Is this the language of people who understand or have really imbibed and internalized the spirit and fine principles of democracy? If we must do your will or face the wrath of government, then, this suggests two things: First, we must obey you and government because we are subservient to you and government. We must be answerable to you not the other way round. We must, because if we don\u2019t, we can be penalized by imprisonment for daring to question its wisdom or seek to have an input in a law that concerns us\u2026<\/p> <p>\u2026To be sure, there is no one, including myself, who is not aware of the dangers posed by the social media. We have all been victims. However, should the government wish to address this matter legally and openly, why should they be afraid of a public debate?<\/p> <p>Public debate<\/p> <p>\u2026Technology is here to stay. All we can do is to try to make it work for us\u2026the future of employment lies there and we need to extend the frontiers of the imagination of our [brilliant and energetic] youths to enable them explore a future that can make us safer and prosperous\u2026<\/p> <p>\u2026It is a measure of who we are and the premium we place on life that anyone would dream of suggesting a death sentence for the propagation of Hate speech. Surely, unscrupulous and immoral theft of humungous resources belonging to all of us by our politicians is more damaging to our society than any Hate speech. It is like comparing saliva and a dam\u2026.<\/p> <p>The ultimate goal of this Bill is not to punish those who offend, but those who offend government or those in government\u2026<\/p> <p>The Government [already] has all the laws it needs to fight any form of crime\u2026This Bill is a redundant, stale, superfluous\u2026totalitarian attempt to circumscribe our hard earned freedom.<\/p> <p>Vanguard<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3FVBZG9CLLT76OT3GOU6RJOW643H04"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":1240,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Lagos","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Omoyele Sowore","victim_keywords":"journalist, opposition candidate, politician, Sahara Reporters, kidnapped, Lagos","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Jones Abiri","victim_keywords":"publisher, editor in chief, Weekly Source, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Agba Jalingo","victim_keywords":"publisher, Cross River Watch, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","kidnapping","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Lagos","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Omoyele Sowore","victim_keywords":"journalist, opposition candidate, politician, Sahara Reporters, kidnapped, Lagos","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Jones Abiri","victim_keywords":"publisher, editor in chief, Weekly Source, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Agba Jalingo","victim_keywords":"publisher, Cross River Watch, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":938254860,"Input.title":"Booker prize-longlisted author Tsitsi Dangarembga arrested in Zimbabwe","Input.publish_date":"2020-07-31 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Tsitsi Dangarembga, the award-winning Zimbabwean novelist who was nominated for the Booker prize longlist earlier this week, was arrested on Friday amid a sweeping crackdown by security agencies ahead of planned anti-corruption demonstrations.<\/p> <p>Hundreds of police and soldiers remained on the streets of Harare, the capital, and others cities late into the evening, ordering inhabitants to go home and stay indoors.<\/p> <p>Tensions have risen in the poor southern African country recently, as security agencies have sought to stifle widespread anger at soaring prices, inadequate public services and allegations of corruption at the highest levels of President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government.<\/p> <p>Harare\u2019s usually bustling centre was virtually empty throughout the day.

Three of the four main architects involved \u2013 Grimshaw, Scott Brownrigg and Haptic Architects \u2013 are British. Norwegian practice Nordic was the other international practice involved alongside Turkish architects Fonksiyon and TAM\/Kiklop.<\/p> <p>Crushed to death<\/p> <p>The first time Osman saw someone die, he was queuing in his truck, working the night shift.<\/p> <p>The drop-off points were always manned by a worker on foot. They would beckon the vehicles into position and direct the dumping of loads.<\/p> <p>Another vehicle in the queue had excavated material piled way above the driver\u2019s cab. It was a larger truck designed to accommodate 80 tonnes but was carrying around half as much again.<\/p> <p>As the line of trucks moved forward, the overloaded vehicle moved into position to release its load.<\/p> <p>The worker directing traffic moved across the back of the truck to gesture where it should be dropped. But the visibility was poor and the driver could not see him. A horrified Osman watched as the hatch was released and the earth was tipped over the man behind the vehicle. He was buried alive and did not survive. That victim wasn\u2019t the first and he wouldn\u2019t be the last.<\/p> <p>Questions over safety training<\/p> <p>By the time they\u2019d discovered Arda*, it was too late, he\u2019d bled to death. As the workers looked down at the corpse, its arm blackened from dried blood, they knew Arda\u2019s death could have been prevented if there had been safety measures and emergency protocols, or if anyone had known what to do to save him.<\/p> <p>When someone was injured or killed, supervisors would promise to train the workers. But nobody we spoke to knew of such training ever taking place<\/p> <p>None of the workers we spoke to had been given health and safety training. Instead, they had signed forms that said they had been trained \u2013 but the documents were simply for show.<\/p> <p>When someone was injured or killed, supervisors would call the men together and promise to train them. But nobody we spoke to knew of such training ever taking place \u2013 they\u2019d just write down ID numbers and act as if it had.<\/p> <p>In some instances, the charade went further. Workers say that wherever international companies were operating, the appearance of the site would be transformed to give the appearance of a safe working environment. Traffic lights and safety barriers would be installed, and shifts reduced to eight hours.<\/p> <p>File8<\/p> <p>But when the foreigners moved on to a different section, the safety measures went with them.<\/p> <p>The workers\u2019 accommodation, which was situated far away from the bedrooms occupied by the international engineers and architects, was even worse. Beds were ridden with bed bugs, rotten food crawling with insects was served and facilities often had no running water.<\/p> <p>Arda was one of the unlucky ones. He\u2019d got out from his vehicle to clean dirt from the piston that raised the back of the truck because it was so filthy. In the process of removing the dried mud, his arm had become trapped and started bleeding.<\/p> <p>He was stranded on his own for many hours and by the time someone found him, Arda was dead.<\/p> <p>Dangers on the roof<\/p> <p>Burak* never got used to the sound of sirens. They blared across the site around five times a day and were a sign that someone was badly hurt.<\/p> <p>He worked as a roofer on one of the terminal buildings and had seen some near misses himself. He\u2019d had to drag his friend\u2019s leg from underneath a girder, that had been accidentally lowered on to it by a crane.<\/p> <p>But what scared him more than anything was that the wind would blow the roof off, something he\u2019d seen happen in other places.<\/p> <p>Joining the roof sections together, he was forced to cut corners and use fewer bolts than intended. Burak could see there were five holes for screws, but he was only allowed to put three in.<\/p> <p>When roofers asked \u2018why don\u2019t we put the full amount in?\u2019 bosses would reply, \u2018don\u2019t complain.\u2019<\/p> <p>Burak\u2019s silence was required when the project\u2019s top management or a government inspector came to visit.<\/p> <p>The roof was built using a German engineering system, and foreign engineers would be there for the final quality control. But by the time they came to inspect the roof, you couldn\u2019t tell there were too few screws holding it together.<\/p> <p>File9 1<\/p> <p>\u2018We are not slaves\u2019<\/p> <p>Finally, workers across the site downed tools in September last year because they could no longer stand the filthy living conditions, the disgusting food, the long hours and the sheer risks they were being forced to take.<\/p> <p>By this point, the pressure on iGA to complete the job had been ratcheted up further because of President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s desire to see the airport open in time for Turkish Republic Day at the end of October.<\/p> <p>iGA had already tried and failed to have it open in February 2018 in time for the president\u2019s birthday.<\/p> <p>Yet now it was witnessing thousands chanting \u2018Kole Degiliz\u2019 (\u2018we are not slaves\u2019) while occupying the area where the workers\u2019 shuttle buses departed.<\/p> <p>The police and local gendarmarie were quick on the scene, as too were a handful of Turkish television journalists from broadcaster Arta TV. They captured images of the authorities using water and tear gas to violently disburse the crowds. While 401 workers were arrested and detained because of the walkout, the protests were successful in communicating the plight of the workers to a wider audience including human rights groups and international media outlets such as Reuters.<\/p> <p>Architectural promotion<\/p> <p>In terms of what was known and when, the Turkish media reported that by February 2018 there had been 27 fatalities on the project. The international press picked up on this during the protests that September, and in January this year, Turkish authorities confirmed the number of deaths had risen to 55.<\/p> <p>Yet despite the project\u2019s mass protests and heavy death toll, the British and European architectural practices that designed Istanbul Airport have continued to promote the project in recent months.<\/p> <p>As protesters against the death toll sat in jail, Scott Brownrigg invited British journalists to tour the facility and construction site.<\/p> <p>The six-runway development has a prominent place on the websites of delivery architect Scott Brownrigg and concept architects Grimshaw, Haptic Architects and Nordic Office of Architecture. The practices have entered the scheme for awards, exhibited their design at trade shows and posted about it on social media.<\/p> <p>In October last year, as site protesters sat in jail, Scott Brownrigg \u2013 which acted as lead designer for the new terminal building from March 2015 to October 2017 (initially as GMW) \u2013 invited British journalists to tour the facility and construction site.<\/p> <p>The invitation was sent to coincide with the airport\u2019s partial opening that month on behalf of iGA and boasted that the \u2018incredible\u2019 scheme had been completed \u2018after only 42 months of construction\u2019. Both the AJ and Construction News declined the invitation.<\/p> <p>File4<\/p> <p>Scott Brownrigg says that during its time on site it was \u2018not made aware of any fatalities, poor working conditions or the site safety issues\u2019. On its website, the practice says that it always \u2018considers the social, environmental and economic context\u2019 in which it works and understands that its operations \u2018have impacts at a local, regional and global level\u2019. Additionally, the firm has signed up to the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact which includes sections on protecting human rights and labour rights.<\/p> <p>The practice\u2019s director of aviation, Maurice Rosario, defends its work on the airport but declines to explain how this aligns with its ethical policies other than to say that Scott Brownrigg cannot \u2018control the policies and procedures of our clients\u2019.<\/p> <p>He says: \u2018We developed the design and reviewed mock-ups but were not required to review any on-site work during the construction process.<\/p> <p>\u2018Access to the site was limited and tightly controlled by the EPC contractor,\u2019 he adds. \u2018During this time, we were not made aware of any fatalities.\u2019<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, construction is inherently risky. Deaths and injuries can also happen on UK sites Maurice Rosario, Scott Brownrigg<\/p> <p>Rosario says that Scott Brownrigg was not \u2018contractually responsible\u2019 for on-site delivery and construction, and was \u2018shocked and saddened\u2019 to hear news of the deaths.<\/p> <p>\u2018The safety of all who work on projects we are involved in is of paramount importance,\u2019 he says. \u2018Unfortunately, construction is inherently risky. Deaths and injuries can also happen on UK sites despite extensive work to mitigate them \u2026 it is only by being involved internationally that we can try to make the situation better and provide a catalyst for changing and improving global design standards.\u2019<\/p> <p>Asked about the practice\u2019s recent promotion of the airport, Rosario says the design has won several awards including a World Architecture Festival (WAF) prize and that it is \u2018widely acknowledged to be of architectural interest to journalists and those within the sector\u2019.<\/p> <p>Concept architects Grimshaw, Haptic Architects and Nordic Office of Architecture all ceased working on the project in late 2014 or early 2015, prior to the construction phase, and have voiced shock and sadness about what Grimshaw has described as the scheme\u2019s \u2018alarmingly high number\u2019 of subsequent deaths.<\/p> <p>A spokesperson for Grimshaw says its concept design enabled \u2018straightforward and safe construction\u2019, adding that, \u2018while we are generally always keen to see our projects through to completion\u2019, it decided against bidding for the delivery role \u2018after careful consideration of the very swift programme and associated design and construction challenges.\u2019<\/p> <p>The spokesperson adds: \u2018Istanbul Airport is a very large and complex project and it was clear to us from the outset that our designs should be clear, simple, modular and must prioritise ease of construction.<\/p> <p>\u2018This would allow the contractor to build safely and with reliable quality, even in circumstances where our involvement in the project wouldn\u2019t continue through the later stages of design.<\/p> <p>\u2018As a practice, we place the highest importance on the safety of all who work with us, either directly or indirectly, and we endeavour to work with clients and contractors who maintain the highest possible safety standards for all those involved at every stage of a project.\u2019<\/p> <p>For its part, Nordic, which is based in Oslo, says it is \u2018very proud to have designed this fantastic building\u2019 but also \u2018deeply saddened\u2019 by the scheme\u2019s health and safety record.<\/p> <p>Founding partner Gudmund Stokke says he visited the construction site but did not see evidence that it was \u2018different to any other building site\u2019.<\/p> <p>He adds: \u2018I\u2019m aware of what I\u2019ve read in the newspapers. It is very sad. This experience makes me think in relation to future projects: can we as architects do more to safeguard good working conditions on our building sites?<\/p> <p>\u2018It strikes me that policies for this could be a challenge for the Architects Council of Europe.\u2019<\/p> <p>In a statement from London-based Haptic Architects, the firm says it is \u2018very saddened\u2019 by the large number of people who died building Istanbul Airport, adding \u2018as far as we are concerned any death on site is one too many, as we hold the safety of our teams and co-workers to be of the highest importance.\u2019<\/p> <p>Commenting on the situation, architecture and human rights expert Eyal Weizman, the founder of Forensic Architecture, says he finds it disturbing that contemporary architecture around the world often has what he calls a \u2018pharaonic dimension\u2019.<\/p> <p>He adds: \u2018These projects are made mainly for the affluent sections of society and are built by a poorer migrant workforce under gruelling conditions and schedules.<\/p> <p>\u2018A building like this should be a monument or a memorial. It should be dedicated to the casualties that its architecture and its delivery demanded.\u2019<\/p> <p>\u2018Soul searching\u2019<\/p> <p>What do the workers who endured life in \u2018the cemetery\u2019 \u2013 as the project was nicknamed \u2013 think of the involvement of the international architects?<\/p> <p>For some, it is difficult to see how rolled-out blueprints composed in an airy London studio can relate to a man dying alone in the dirt on a building site near the Black Sea. But for others, the connection is all too clear.<\/p> <p>\u2018English architects need to do some soul-searching,\u2019 says Burak, the roofer.<\/p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s us that put our blood, sweat and tears into building it. Officially, on record, we have 55 friends that died. Their blood has been shed building the airport.<\/p> <p>If the architects are so proud of being part of building the airport, they should be willing to give their lives like the 55 people did<\/p> <p>\u2018Wherever you are in the world, you need to consider the relationship between money and labour. They should think about the workers and support them.\u2019<\/p> <p>In a complex international project, stakeholders naturally tend to be selective about their involvement when things go wrong. But can you boast about your involvement in the world\u2019s biggest airport while simultaneously disassociating yourself from the workers that lost their lives?<\/p> <p>For Burak, whose labour helped bring the architects\u2019 visions to life, this pride should recognise the costs borne by those who built it.<\/p> <p>\u2018If the architects are so proud of being part of building the airport, they should be willing to give their lives like the 55 people did,\u2019 he says.<\/p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not saying the architects or engineers need to die, but none of them did. It shouldn\u2019t be the fate of those building the airport either.\u2019<\/p> <p>Construction News and the Architects\u2019 Journal contacted iGA, detailing the allegations laid out in this article. A public relations company acting on behalf of the joint venture responded with the following message: \u2018iGA will not answer the request you sent.\u2019<\/p> <p>The politics behind the world\u2019s biggest airport As the land on the edge of the Black Sea was transformed from ancient forests to the world\u2019s biggest airport, the rest of Turkey was rapidly changing too. Two years after construction began, the infamous 15 July 2016 G\u00fclen coup d\u2019\u00e9tat took place. Even beforehand President Erdo\u011fan (pictured) and his ruling AKP party were being described by The Economist as establishing a \u2018new sultanate\u2019 that ruled with an \u2018iron grip\u2019. But following the failed coup, Erdo\u011fan further cemented his grip on power. A two-year state of emergency, which came to an end after the election in June 2018, has seen more than 107,000 people removed from public-sector jobs and more than 50,000 people imprisoned pending trial, according to official statistics and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Turkey also became the world\u2019s leader in jailing journalists during this period, topping the Committee to Protect Journalists global list for a third straight year in 2018. Perceived insults of the president on social media platforms such as Twitter, which are also intermittently blocked by the government, can also land you in jail. And Erdo\u011fan\u2019s strongman status has always relied on delivering megaprojects. Multi-billion transport investments, which include a new bridge across the Bosporus, are described by the Turkish leader as his self-proclaimed \u2018crazy projects\u2019. The airport is the latest and most ambitious to date and its successful completion is of great importance to Turkey\u2019s most powerful man.<\/p> <p>Top image: Associated Press<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"35XW21VSVIT9TTW5GBSOTHNMIDVLS2"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":620,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","unknown","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Istanbul","region":"None","country":"Turkey","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"construction workers, safety, deaths, poverty, laborers, Turkey, Istanbul Airport,","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","unknown","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Istanbul","region":"None","country":"Turkey","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"construction workers, safety, deaths, poverty, laborers, Turkey, Istanbul Airport,","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1021832976,"Input.title":"EFF Condemns the Unjust Conviction and Sentencing of Activist and Friend Alaa Abd El Fattah","Input.publish_date":"2022-01-04 10:37:58-08:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>EFF is deeply saddened and angered by the news that our friend, Egyptian blogger, coder, and free speech activist Alaa Abd El Fattah, long a target of oppression by Egypt's successive authoritarian regimes, was sentenced to five years in prison by an emergency state security court just before the holidays.<\/p> <p>According to media reports and social media posts of family members, Fattah, human rights lawyer Mohamed el-Baqer, and blogger Mohamed 'Oxygen' Ibrahim were convicted on December 20 of \"spreading false news undermining national security\" by the court, which has extraordinary powers under Egypt's state of emergency. El-Baqer and Ibrahim received four-year sentences.<\/p> <p>A trial on the charges held in November was a travesty, with defense lawyers denied access to case files or a chance to present arguments. At least 48 human rights defenders, activists, and opposition politicians in pre-trial detention for months and years were referred to the emergency courts for trial just before Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi lifted the state of emergency in October, Human Rights Watch reported.<\/p> <p>The profoundly unjust conviction and years-long targeting of Fattah and other civil and human rights activists is a testament to the lengths the Egyptian government will go to attack and shut down, through harassment, physical violence, arrest, and imprisonment, those speaking out for free speech and expression and sharing information. In the years since the revolution, journalists, bloggers, activists and peaceful protestors have been arrested and charged under draconian press regulations and anti-cybercrime laws being used to suppress dissent and silence those criticizing the government.<\/p> <p>A free speech advocate and software developer, Fattah, who turned 40 on November 18, has repeatedly been targeted and jailed for working to ensure Egyptians and others in the Middle East and North Africa have a voice, and privacy, online.

We stand in solidarity with #SaveAlaa, and Fattah\u2019s family and network of supporters.

Swedish prosecutors have dropped the investigation into the ten-year old rape allegation. Furthermore, a U.S. federal judge has dismissed a Democratic National Committee lawsuit accusing Russia, the Trump campaign, Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange, and others of conspiring to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.

Schneir writes that Assange \u201cis now accused of publishing the Manning documents on his WikiLeaks website. This is a far more serious matter\u2014the first time in the history of the United States that the publication of truthful information has been defined as a crime.\u201d In other words, we are talking about a journalist who may be prosecuted for journalism.<\/p> <p>Caitlin Johnstone warns that \u201conce the Assange precedent has been set by the US government, the US government isn\u2019t going to be relying on your personal definition of what journalism is; they\u2019re going to be using their own, based on their own interests.\u201d When Mike Pompeo was Trump\u2019s CIA director, he pulled out of his pocket a nonsense definition of Assange with no basis in law: a \u201chostile non-state intelligence service.\u201d Yes, informing people about U.S. war crimes is hostile from the perspective of the U.S. government, but how can Assange be an intelligence service if he is serving everyone in the world who has Internet access?<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks Showed Us How Washington Deceives Japan<\/p> <p>Let us look at how WikiLeaks has improved our understanding of the ways in which Washington (mis)treats its most important ally, Japan. Assange\u2019s non-hostile service, including a \u201cpublic library of US diplomacy,\u201d has greatly expanded our understanding of how Washington exploits Japanese people.<\/p> <p>Edward Snowden, a truth-teller who helped Washington for many years, alerted us to the fact that Washington was backstabbing Japan. For example, we heard in Oliver Stone\u2019s film \u201cSnowden\u201d that if Japan went \u201crogue\u201d and stopped obeying Washington, they could shut down Japan\u2019s power grid. Snowden also informed us that Washington was spying on everyone around the world, including the people of allied states such as Japan.<\/p> <p>By sharing the cables that exposed wrongdoing, WikiLeaks has again confirmed for those of us in Northeast Asia that Washington is not to be trusted, even by precious allies like Japan, despite the fact that Tokyo and Washington are in constant, close consultation. The Japan-based journalist David McNeill quotes a Japanese newspaper: \u201cThe U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and the State Department exchanged 5,697 diplomatic cables between 2006 and 2010 (226 of them secret), the third largest number from any diplomatic mission after Ankara and Baghdad: The cables include classified documents on Okinawa, diplomatic relations with North Korea and China, and joint ballistic missile defense.\u201d That is an average of four messages per day.<\/p> <p>An expert on US bases in Okinawa, Japan, Maedomari Hironori emphasizes how strange the Washington-Tokyo relationship is: \u201cRight in the middle of the metropolis of Tokyo there exists a giant base for another country\u2019s military, and although Japan is put in a subservient position with respect to Washington, none of the citizens of Japan are concerned about this. They approve of this US privilege. Nobody knows how often occupying troops are forgiven for the violation of our laws. US military aircraft are guaranteed free passage through the air space of our territory. And they get a free pass when they fly at low altitudes in residential areas.\u201d (September 2018 issue of the progressive political magazine Sekai)<\/p> <p>Through WikiLeaks, however, we received solid confirmation that what Washington really cares about is the \u201crelocation of Futenma Marine Corps Air Station on Okinawa and providing funds for USMC-related facilities on Guam.\u201d (Quoted by Shorrock in The WikiLeaks Files). Those are the words of the US embassy in Tokyo in a secret cable to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when it was reported that the purpose of her trip was supposed to be offering \u201creassurance\u201d to the Japanese government that We were on their side.<\/p> <p>\u201cCough up the cash,\u201d America says to its sidekick Japan. Shorrock notes that Japanese taxpayers were supposed to provide $900 million for the \u201cUSMC-related facilities on Guam.\u201d From that same cable we learn that \u201cour,\u201d i.e., Tokyo and Washington\u2019s, \u201cmissile defense cooperation is moving forward quickly and we are increasing bilateral planning coordination and intelligence sharing.\u201d Many astute observers had already gathered as much, but it is one thing for a newspaper journalist to say it, and quite another to see the Bully Government saying it.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the \u201cmissile defense cooperation\u201d and \u201cintelligence sharing\u201d here encompassed Japan\u2019s interest in purchasing the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense system or Aegis Ashore. (In the end, Japan went with Aegis Ashore). Assange has suggested that the US provoked North Korea, such as through its war games, so that North Korea would continue to develop nukes and missiles and the US would have an excuse to install THAAD in South Korea. And he criticized the deployment of THAAD in South Korea in the context of US relations with China. (There is a concern that \u201csince China sees THAAD as actually directed at it, Beijing may well respond by expanding its arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles\u201d. In short, the leaked cables show Washington manipulating both South Korea and Japan in order to sell them THAAD and Aegis, complements of Lockheed Martin.<\/p> <p>In the case of Japan, Okinawa is Japan\u2019s \u201csacrifice zone,\u201d gifted to the US military, and now used as a U.S. training center for Middle East wars. But many Japanese and a few good Americans would like to know more specifics, about in what manner Tokyo is pressured to manipulate Okinawa, to violate the constitution of Japan, block democracy, and continue their assault on the living things of the ocean in Henoko, Okinawa. As Maedomari sees it, we do not know about who is responsible for what, and there is no accountability in Okinawa, because discussions between Washington and Tokyo are hidden in a kind of \u201cblack box.\u201d<\/p> <p>The face that Washington presents to the world is very different from the face that we get a glimpse of through WikiLeaks cables. WikiLeaks confirmed that the NSA has spied on Japanese companies, too. As early as 1999, it was rumored in Japan that Washington\u2019s Ladylove satellite communications interception facilities at Misawa Air Base were part of the ECHELON civilian telecommunications monitoring program. We heard that surveillance at the Base allowed the US to gather intelligence from conversations held at the prime minister\u2019s residence in Tokyo. At the time it sounded crazy, but WikiLeaks has confirmed that it is true: Our Government spies on elite Japanese politicians as well as major Japanese firms. But Tokyo\u2019s special \u201cclient state\u201d relationship with Washington is so precious to Japan\u2019s elites that the Japanese government could only muster up the courage to call this violation of trust \u201cdeeply regrettable.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cClothed in the rhetoric of civility, they continue to enact Manifest Destiny,\u201d Nozomi Hayase writes in \u201cImprisoned Light of Our Civilization that Kindled the Heart of Democracy,\u201d in In Defense of Julian Assange. Yes. Our Government with its War Machine continues to implement the Open Door Policy. But this must be hidden from the eyes of Washington\u2019s closest allies, both the governments and their citizens, if it is to succeed. Hayase exposes the lack of free exchange of information and ideas in Japan when she writes that WikiLeaks \u201callows marginalized perspectives to come forward and challenge the claims of professional journalists.\u201d Hardly any such journalists in Japan have written about Assange or quoted WikiLeaks cables. (See also Hayase\u2019s CounterPunch essay.) The anonymous Japanese journalist quoted by David McNeill may be right that journalists in Japan \u201cdo not approve of what Assange did.\u201d<\/p> <p>It is through the work of WikiLeaks that Japanese can see how Our Government is complicit in supporting Their Government\u2019s illegal whale killing; They can see how Their Government communicated to Our Government their preference for a \u201cdivided Korean peninsula to one reunified under Seoul\u201d (McNeill); They can see that Their Government is bending to pressure from Our Government to start selling weapons overseas, that Washington wants Japan to sell the \u201csophisticated system known as the SM-3 (a ship-based missile system) to other nations, possibly including South Korea,\u201d even if Japan is forced to \u201crewrite its tight restrictions on weapons exports, which have been a pillar of the nation\u2019s post-World War II pacifism\u201d (McNeill); and They can see that Tokyo is backstabbing the hibakusha (A-bomb survivors) with the help of Washington elites who feel no remorse for Truman\u2019s war crime. In 2001 we in Japan learned from WikiLeaks that the US Ambassador to Japan cabled then Secretary of State Clinton about the idea of Obama apologizing to Japanese: \u201cBoth governments must temper the public\u2019s expectations on such issues, as the idea of President Obama visiting Hiroshima to apologize for the atomic bombing during World War II is a \u2018non-starter.\u2019\u201d This showed everyone in Japan that Tokyo\u2019s efforts on behalf of the hibakusha were a \u201csham,\u201d as one representative of the Hiroshima Alliance for Nuclear Weapons Abolition called them.<\/p> <p>The Bully never misses an opportunity to raise the stakes and run toward the precipice of the disaster of war in Northeast Asia. Japan and South Korea already pay for most of Our expenses incurred at the bases that they host, but when asked, \u201cHow much should we give?\u201d Washington only replies, \u201cMore more more.\u201d It is poetic justice that the greedy billionaire Trump is the spokesperson for Our Greedy Government and Greedy Corporations, demanding of Japan and of South Korea that they pay five times more. At least the South Koreans are outraged.<\/p> <p>Conclusion<\/p> <p>A number of people, including John Pilger, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture Nils Melzer, and Editor-In-Chief of WikiLeaks Kristinn Hrafnsson have informed us that Julian Assange\u2019s health is being ruined, i.e., knocked down by years of being stuck in unhealthy physical environments and undergoing psychological abuse. Melzer said, \u201cMy most urgent concern is that, in the United States, Mr. Assange would be exposed to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights, including his freedom of expression, his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d In his view, these governments (including the US, the UK, and Sweden) are \u201cganging up to deliberately isolate, demonise and abuse\u201d Assange.<\/p> <p>The problem for Washington is that if Assange successfully pulls off this bee sting without getting his head cut off, other journalists will follow in his footsteps. Even Japanese, who mostly trust Washington, might start to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d when Washington twists their arm demanding they pay more for Washington\u2019s empire. They might start to wonder if the US-Japan Security Treaty (anpo) is all that it is cracked up to be. Worst of all, more Japanese may start dropping their prejudices against Okinawans, line up alongside them, and collectively say no to Japan\u2019s participation in Washington\u2019s endless wars.<\/p> <p>In Japan, there is less free flow of information than in the US, and therefore, the information that Assange and WikiLeaks provide us is an especially precious resource. Japanese and Americans, rise to the occasion, for the sake of the freedom of the press, if not for the sake of a great journalist who is being unjustly abused.<\/p> <p>Many thanks to Stephen Brivati for comments, suggestions, and editing.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"35U0MRQMULMXR6G6NYDLWLBNCMUVOY"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":718,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2016","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, extradition, Ecuadorean embassy, failing health","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2016","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, extradition, Ecuadorean embassy, failing health","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":953949122,"Input.title":"Sri Lanka Guardian","Input.publish_date":"2020-11-04 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Rajapaksas created a moral wasteland and called it patriotism, and damned anyone not succumbing to it as traitors to the nation.

They made a conscious attempt to turn that nodal point of struggle into a microcosm of a different Sri Lanka, a place where racial and religious animosities were absent, the youth were heard and women could be both active and safe, a space of sanity, decency, compassion, and reason. A symbol of the best in us both as individuals and a nation, a microcosm of what Sri Lanka could be when her people embrace their best impulses rather than the worst.<\/p> <p>As the days passed and the struggle spread, that spirit seemed to be spilling over and permeating other loci of resistance. Even when a young father of two was brutally gunned down in Rambukkana by the police, the protestors resisted the siren song of violent retaliation. Despite innumerable provocations by the Rajapaksas, sanity and peace prevailed.<\/p> <p>Then Mahinda Rajapaksa, the political paterfamilias of this most egregious of political families, went to the ancient city of Anuradhapura. He visited a couple of sacred places, experienced the public\u2019s ire in loud calls for his resignation, and had a powwow with his abiding supporters, solidifying plans which would have been laid days before were solidified.<\/p> <p>Next morning, busloads of Mahinda devotees and hired thugs (reportedly at 2000rupees a day, a reflection of the economic crisis and the resultant mass desperation) were brought to Temple Trees. Mahinda Rajapaksa gave them a speech. They poured out of the Temple Trees armed with poles and laid waste to Maina-go-gama, the protest encampment outside the premises. Then, with no hindrance from the police, who would have been told to stay out of it by their political masters, they made their way to Gota-go-gama and laid waste to it. Even the makeshift library did not escape the devastating onslaught.<\/p> <p>Meantime, the government declared a curfew effective immediately.<\/p> <p>From that point, events departed drastically from the Rajapaksa script. The protesters resisted and overcame the attackers. Across the country, people, ignoring the curfew, poured on to streets in solidarity.<\/p> <p>Knowingly or unknowingly, the Rajapaksas had done something more devastating than sending an army of thugs to attack the two protest encampments. They had sent a dose of their own poison along with their thugs. The unarmed protestors confronted the defeated the attackers. But not before the toxin was injected into the bloodstream of the protest movement.<\/p> <p>As day turned into night, the anti-Rajapaksa struggle moved away from being the antithesis of Rajapaksas, and became their pale copy.<\/p> <p>Means and ends: the old conundrum. The ruins of struggles and revolutions corroded from within remind us that means shape and colour ends. An unjust struggle cannot create a just society. Mobs are mobs, limbs without heads or hearts guided by a single compulsion, irrespective of what their battle-cry is, be it Kill Tamils or Aragalayata Jayaweva (Victory to the Struggle).<\/p> <p>The public stripping of Rajapaksa thugs by Gota-go-gama protestors symbolise the discarding of the core-values of resistance, decency, mercy, and non-excess. The fires engulfing hated SLPP leaders are also incinerating the promise of a better Sri Lanka.<\/p> <p>Learning from history<\/p> <p>On 22nd October 2007, a group of Black Tigers attacked the Saliyapura air force camp in Anuradhapura. Afterwards, the Lankan Forces stripped the corpses of the attackers (including of three women) and paraded them in the Anuradhapura town: Many local people, instead of cheering, responded with embarrassment and even outrage.<\/p> <p>Two years later, the dead body of Vellupillai Pirapaharan, was stripped down to his underpants, and displayed \u2013 to wild acclaim. There was no shame or embarrassment when pictures of captured Tiger cadres, including radio announcer Issipriya and Vellupillai Pirapaharan\u2019s 13 year old son (a non-combatant) were publicised, pictures taken shortly before they were murdered.<\/p> <p>In two short years, the Rajapaksas had succeeded in infecting Sinhala society with their brand of unethical ethics. Only success and victory mattered, not the road to it, or its aftermath. With this sanctification of the abhorrent, Lankan society reached a new level of brutalisation.<\/p> <p>To heal that Sri Lanka the Rajapaksa virus has to be removed from the national bloodstream. In the month since current protests began, the hope that we are on our way to such a cure began to take root. That hope is now almost dead. When Galle Face protestors stripped their attackers, took pictures of them, and paraded them, when those indecencies were lionised and those pictures celebrated, that development held up a mirror before us. The visage is showed belonged to the enemy we wanted to depose. We might all be against the Rajapaksas now; but we have not stopped being like them.<\/p> <p>If further evidence was needed, it came in the form of a series of tweets by journalist Roel Raymond, published in Newswire. Ms. Raymond was doing her job as a journalist, recording the public protest at the back gate of the Temple Trees. The protestors objected to their doings being recorded by her. \u201cWatched men stripped naked, beaten and bloodied being brought in, some carried by hands and legs. Terrible scenes. Same crowd would have turned on me had I not been taken out by friends,\u201d she wrote in her first tweet. Two minutes later, the second one, \u201cTear gas just now shot at protestors there so I am glad I got out in the nick of time. Had actually feared I too would be stripped and beaten...\u201d<\/p> <p>She ended her tweet by saying \u201cRajapaksas you did this.\u201d There is no argument that with their brutal attacks on Galle Face and Temple Trees protestors, the Rajapaksas paved the road to this calamity. But was it inevitable? Why did non-violent protestors allow Rajapaksas to push them into violence? Why did ordinary human beings let Rajapaksas turn them into rampaging mobs? Do we have no will of our own? Must we always react, and rush like driven cattle?<\/p> <p>What is the difference between this reaction, and other reactive actions such as Black July or the LTTE\u2019s Anuradhapura massacre? Must we always pile wrong on wrong, respond to violence with violence, become like the enemy we oppose?<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t we have minds of our own to make different choices and the courage to activate them?<\/p> <p>When Black July erupted, individual Sinhalese helped individual Tamils, but as a society we failed to take a stand against the crimes being committed in our name. The same thing happened vis-a-vis the LTTE and the Tamil society (with some courageous exceptions like Rajini Rajasingham Thiranagama). It was the same story during the second JVP insurgency, the Eelam War (especially the fourth one) and the various attacks on Christians and Muslims by Sinhala mobs.<\/p> <p>This unwillingness to criticise our own side, intolerance of such criticism to the point of equating it with enemy action continues.<\/p> <p>Stripping and photographing one\u2019s opponent, parading them around sans clothes is not resistance or heroism. It is brutality, cowardice, and thuggery on par with the Rajapaksas. Those who attack and burn houses and destroy vehicles are not protestors. They are mobs. We failed\/refused to see these differences in the past. If we are still unable\/unwilling to make those distinctions, if we are still reluctant to criticise our own side, how can our national future be any different from our national past?<\/p> <p>The solution to tyranny is not anarchy<\/p> <p>Ignoring the rule of law, replacing the rule of law with the law of the rulers is a Rajapaksa trait. Now we, their opponents, have taken a leaf from their book, replacing the rule of law by the law of the mobs.<\/p> <p>This way, even if the Rajapaksas go today and go willingly, their tyranny will not be succeeded by democracy but by anarchy.<\/p> <p>This embracing of violence, illegality and indecency can lead to one of three outcomes: the Rajapaksas aligning themselves with the military and imposing a reign of terror; the military capturing power and imposing a reign of terror; mob rule imposing a reign of terror. Always, and each time, a reign of terror, with no peace or stability, no justice or tolerance.<\/p> <p>There is still time to stop, turn back, take a less devastating path, realise the promise of the first phase of the struggle. Politicians of all stripes have lost credibility and relevance. But there are others who can still provide a reasoned, just, and democratic leadership to the leaderless resistance. Lawyers led by the BASL, doctors led by SLMA (and not the GMOA), a few religious figures, some trade union and civil society leaderds can still come forward to educate, explain, and guide the struggle away from the looming abyss. Similarly the leading activists of Gota-go-gama should condemn the ongoing violence and plead for a cessation.<\/p> <p>The Rajapaksas must go, not one or some of them, but all of them including President Gotabaya. Maybe the chief justice can be an interim president until the executive presidency is abolished. Maybe a group of experts, sent to parliament via national list, form a cabinet, and implement urgent economic and political measures until an election is held, perhaps in six months. These measures may not be strictly constitutional, but the alternative is the constitution either being suspended under military rule or becoming irrelevant under mob rule.<\/p> <p>In the Iliad, when god Hephaestos devised a new shield for Achilles at the request of his mother, he adorned that instrument of war with scenes of peace. Perhaps it was his, and the poet\u2019s way of reminding humanity of what it loses to violence.<\/p> <p>The memories of the first Gota-go-gama, a haven of peace, a place of promise, its images recorded for posterity, is like the Shield of Achilles, a reminder of what we could be if we, in our just anger, don\u2019t give into our worst impulses. There is still time to stop, to change track, to stop being like Rajapaksas, to abandon their ethos, to cleanse ourselves of their toxin, to be not just against the Rajapaksas but opposite them.<\/p> <p>The Rajapaksas created a moral wasteland and called it patriotism, and damned anyone not succumbing to it as traitors to the nation. In that desert, anything could be done to the enemy, anything; law, morality, ethics, decency, pity, mercy, compassion, reason were all banned in that space.<\/p> <p>The anti-Rajapaksa struggle is in the process of creating a similar moral wasteland, calling it Aragalaya (struggle) where anything goes, so long as it is done to the Rajapaksas and their supporters.<\/p> <p>How can a different Sri Lanka, a better Sri Lanka come into being in such a place?<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t try to teach Gota-go-game protestors; just learn from them was a popular saying in the resistance space. There was much to learn from Gota-go-gama protestors. But they too had \u2013 and have \u2013 much to learn from history. And one key lesson is that attempts to create utopias end in dystopias, always, every time.<\/p> <p>Violence, intolerance, indecency, these are all habit forming. And once the habit is formed, escaping is harder. Political devastation will worsen economic devastation. No aid, no trade, no investment, no production, nothing to consume, more want, more poverty, more anger, more violence, eventually turning on Tamils, on Muslims on other Sinhalese, the worst vicious cycle, endlessly repeated.<\/p> <p>We can stop that degeneration. Still. If we depart from the false turn, now.<\/p> <p>Tomorrow will be too late.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"35F6NGNVMAYBT8KI1HW4KH17PC4T7Q"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":607,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["killing"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vellupillai Pirapaharan","victim_keywords":"murdered, showcase, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protestors, Gota-go-gama, Gota-go-game, Tamil, anti-Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka, Temple Trees","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["killing"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vellupillai Pirapaharan","victim_keywords":"murdered, showcase, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protestors, Gota-go-gama, Gota-go-game, Tamil, anti-Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka, Temple Trees","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":954252721,"Input.title":"Minister Rugumayo\u2019s tales of Amin\u2019s terror","Input.publish_date":"2020-11-08 10:14:44","Input.article_interface":"<p>In 1973, President Idi Amin\u2019s Minister of Education Prof Albert Edward Bitanywaine Rugumayo and Foreign Affairs\u2019 Joshua Wanume Kibedi visited Kenya on official duties but the two decided to cable their resignation letters to Amin and opted to remain in exile.<\/p> <p>The flight of the two prominent ministers followed a fierce wave of indiscriminate killings and disappearances in the country followed by careless dismissal of several ministers in February 1973 including Labour Minister Abu Mayanja, Culture Minister Yekosafati Engur (who was later murdered in 1977), Tourism Minister Apollo Kironde and Animal Resource Minister Prof William Banange, branding them as \u201cinsufficient\u201d.<\/p> <p>Rugumayo was the first to send his resignation letter to the President.<\/p> <p>\u201cAfter a very careful consideration of the situation in our country, I have decided to resign my office,\u201d he noted adding: \u201cThe reasons for my resignation are purely personal and moral and are based on the fact that I have found it increasingly difficult to fulfill my duties in the atmosphere that prevails in our country.<\/p> <p>Amin hastily replied that he was unperturbed by Rugumayo\u2019s cowardly decision and accepted the resignation without hesitation, adding that the Education Minister had been under strain because of the death of his wife and \u201cconstant threats\u201d made by Milton Obote\u2019s guerrillas to assassinate him and other ministers.<\/p> <p>The defected Rugumayo however, approached the European and African diplomatic missions in Nairobi and made his views of Amin and his government known in a memorandum to African Heads of State and Governments.<\/p> <p>Thus his full description of Amin and his government goes as follows:<\/p> <p>\u201cAmin is an illiterate soldier of very low intelligence from the minority Nubian\/ Kakwa tribe and an adherent of the minority Islam religion. He is medically unfit; he suffers from a hormonal defect. He is racist and a fascist; a murderer and a blasphemer; a tribalist and a dictator. Gen Amin has no principles, no moral standards and scruples. He will kill, or cause to kill, anyone without hesitation as long as it serves his interests, such as prolonging his stay in power, or getting what he wants such as a woman or money.<\/p> <p>He is an incorrigible liar, both locally and internationally; his word in international dealings should never be relied on. He possesses no moral or political standards. He sets his own \u2018standards\u2019, writes his own \u2018rules\u2019 and changes them as he moves along. It therefore becomes very difficult for anyone to predict his moves. If we take that level of illiteracy for a President of a modern state, the problem takes on fantastic dimensions. For instance, Amin finds it well-nigh impossible to sit in an office for a day. He cannot concentrate on any serious topic for half a morning. He does not read. He cannot write. The sum total of these disabilities makes it impossible for him either to sit in the regular cabinet, to follow up cabinet minutes, or to comprehend the briefs written to him by his ministers.<\/p> <p>In short, he is out of touch with the daily running of the country, not because he likes it but because of illiteracy.<\/p> <p>He rarely attends the cabinet, and even then it is only when he is giving directives about the problems concerning defence or \u201csecurity\u201d of the country, or when he is sacking some civil servant. So the only means of getting the information about the country which he rules is by ear from various sources. In other words, he relies solely on listening and perhaps seeing.<\/p> <p>Since most of his ministers are what one might term technocrats, he finds them too complicated and uninteresting, although they are the people who should actually give him correct information. Instead, he has to have recourse to people of his own level of intelligence and calibre. In effect, these are the people who rule the country: the illiterate and semi-literate army officers who have recently been drafted into the service. Practically, all of them get their information by word of mouth and get directives from their superiors verbally. Since little is ever written down, and once said, there is little or no follow-up to change the plan or check the facts. This type of government can lead to disastrous result, especially where security is concerned.<\/p> <p>Illiteracy led to overloading of Amin\u2019s memory. In one instance, he deported three expatriate doctors he had been told were British spies, bombastically accusing them of spreading \u201cpolitical gonorrhoea\u201d. Two of them were members of his medical team. We are presented with a picture of a man who cannot fathom the complex problems of modern society...he oversimplifies the problems as well as their solutions, to the detriment of the entire nation\u2019s future. He thinks governing a country means talking to and entertaining big crowds of people.<\/p> <p>He does not possess slightest rudiments about economics. For instance, he was urging his Finance Minister to print more paper money if there was not enough money in government coffers. The country is bankrupt. A lot of the money is spent on spying, the army and his personal projects. He has literally millions of shillings, in USA dollars which he keeps at his house in case of troubles. He has deposited millions in Libya, to which he will retire in the event of trouble. In fact he has bought three big villas in Tripoli for his personal use.<\/p> <p>His abysmal ignorance has made him hate education, educated people and educational institutions. He brags that if he could rule the country well, then there is no need for highly educated people. Amin fired an experienced, fully qualified public servant from the job of permanent secretary to the President\u2019s Office replacing him with an Assistant District Commissioner educated only to school certificate level. Chairmanship of the Public Service Commission went to the Town Clerk of a small town in Karamoja region, Moroto. Both the new appointees came from Amin\u2019s West Nile home region.<\/p> <p>On my first trip with him to Libya, Amin assured Col. Gadaffi that 80 per cent of Uganda\u2019s population was Muslim and that this majority had for long been dominated by Christian or heathen minority. In truth- Muslim- mainly the Nubians only accounted for not more than 10 per cent of the population. Both Libya and Saudi Arabia donated money from the Jihad (Holy War) Fund to be used to eliminate the few remaining Christians and turn Uganda into a Muslim country.<\/p> <p>Amin\u2019s first victims had been Catholic; Chief Justice (Benedicto) Kiwanuka was a catholic, Father Kiggundu, the editor of the Catholic newspaper Munno had been abducted and burnt to death. Munno reported a Women\u2019s Council resolution calling for the investigation into \u2018disappearances\u2019. Amin went on to liquidate many of the important Catholics in the civil service and business world... many Catholic prison officers, administrative secretaries and others. He went further to attack nuns and priests in the press for allegedly acting as spies. He also turned against Protestants. Among the leading protestant killed: Michael Kaggwa. Amin was also known to be interested in Kaggwa\u2019s girlfriend (Hallen Ogwang).<\/p> <p>Methods of killing<\/p> <p>The former minister further notes in his letter: \u201cThe methods of killing used during the first months of the coup included straight-forward shooting or beating; with disposal of dead bodies becoming a problem, the soldiers resorted to throwing bodies of their victims either in rivers, swamps or even water reservoirs. This was found to be unsatisfactory, as human bodies tend to float and to attract vultures. Later, they were simply thrown into the bush and left there to rot or eaten by wild beasts, or were burnt by petrol fires.<\/p> <p>Amin\u2019s principal killers were to devise harrowing tortures. The victims would line up and the first one would be ordered to lie down while the prisoner next to him was then ordered to smash his head with a huge hammer. The trend would go on until the last man who would either be shot by Towelli himself or be killed in the same brutal manner by a police officer.

As per the news item, Dr. Rukshan Bellana, President of the Government Medical Officers\u2019 Forum, has told that the health service is maintained by the taxes levied on the people of the country and if they have any problems, a civilized society will not allow them to take the patients hostage without resolving them through negotiations. He also said that this was being done as a trade union struggle to do what the political parties wanted and that the trade unions affiliated to the political parties\u2019 should be banned and that the people should unite against such rallies. He said that some of the trade union-based instances and attempts to base themselves on various demands such as going to parliament from national lists and requesting ministerial posts in ministries.<\/p> <p>Although Dr Bellana has not named the individuals who are currently posing as trade union leaders, we are fully aware of how a trade union activist attached to the health sector entered the parliament for a week or two via the national list for his political services rendered to the Yahapalana government. What he did to the duty free vehicle license thus obtained has become an interesting issue. The easiest way to find out how they even contributed to the continuation of terrorism in the past is to search their records on line. Interestingly, I found a list of names of the trade union activists attached to the Health services among the list of politicians, so-called civil societies and trade union activists, who were promoting LTTE as an integral part of \u2018the solution\u2019 and campaigning in support of the CFA in 2006, in a pro LTTE website (https:\/\/www.tamilnet.com\/art.html?artid=19261&catid=13).<\/p> <p>Freedom to involve in strikes were very limited (or not at all) for the government employees prior to 1956. As a result of granting some freedom to the government and public sector employees affiliated to political parties in 1956, we remember how trade unions of \u2018comrades\u2019 political parties who called upon workers to \u2018establish an administration of the working class\u2019 started strikes throughout the country even for extremely minor issues. While addressing a public meeting during the 1960 elections held after the assassination of SWRD, Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranike stated how those \u2018comrades\u2019 parties, \u2018politically killed him without physically killing\u2019 (\u2018\u2019nomara maruwa\u2019\u2019) her husband by promoting strikes. By allowing politicians of successive governments to interfere with the appointments of various positions within the public service, the government servants and their trade unions are politically divided to an uncontrollable extent today. I remember, as a former employee, how those \u2018comrades\u2019 started their first ever strike in the then Ceylon Steel Corporation in 1969 and how they attempted to achieve their dream of \u2018an administration of the working class\u2019 by chasing away forcefully the non union members and the leading administration including the Chairman and the General Manger from the site, after their failed strike and return back to work. Some of the officers had to runaway for fear of life and finally, the then the Minister of Industries Mr Phiip Gunawardana had to interfere and ensure their safety for them to reenter the Corporation site.<\/p> <p>Although right to strikes is considered as a human right and recognized in almost all so-called democratic champion countries, they have introduced legislations to regulate the strike actions. In particular; they impose limitations for the strikes of workers in public essential services, such as health, security, movements, assistance and welfare, education, and communications.<\/p> <p>In the UK, strike action organized by a trade union is legal provided some tough conditions are met. For example: The union must have conducted a lawful ballot of all the members it believes will be called upon to take part. In Australia, there may be a right to strike in limited circumstances, but in practice there is no right to strike, except for exceptional circumstances.<\/p> <p>Under Australian laws, strikes can only happen during bargaining. At all other times they are unlawful.<\/p> <p>Even during bargaining there are too many hurdles. Before workers can take a bargaining strike they must prove that they are genuinely trying to reach agreement, hold a secret ballot, give their employer three clear days notice of the strike etc. If a strike happens outside of bargaining then workers and their unions face dire consequences.<\/p> <p>The employer can:<\/p> <p>Gets an automatic order from the Fair Work Commission requiring a return to work.<\/p> <p>Get injunctions from Federal and State Courts.<\/p> <p>Discipline workers or sack them.<\/p> <p>Sue unions and workers for contempt of court if orders or injunctions are not followed to the letter.<\/p> <p>Sue the workers and their union under various laws for fines up to $10,800 for workers and $54,000 for unions.<\/p> <p>Seek compensation against workers and their unions for lost revenue.<\/p> <p>Even if the employer doesn\u2019t want to take legal action, government agencies, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Australian Building and Construction Commission can initiate such actions.<\/p> <p>I spent almost half of employment life outside Sri Lanka including African and Pacific regions, I have not come across or even seen a single strike in those countries similar to what is going on in Sri Lanka. Considering the inconvenience caused to the general public, while accepting the right to strikes, the government should take necessary steps to regulate the strike actions, at least, in public essential services similar to what the other countries do in the world.<\/p> <p>S.

A graduate of West Virginia State College, Zain had only managed to pass some of his chemistry courses by the skin of his teeth, while utterly failing in others. Somehow, these flashing signs of inability didn\u2019t prevent him from landing jobs as a police chemist for the state of West Virginia and chief of physical evidence in Bexar County, Texas. But they may explain why Zain spent the duration of his forensics career habitually faking lab results and lying to courtrooms in order to secure criminal convictions.<\/p> <p>Over a span of 13 years, prosecutors in two states sought out Zain\u2019s ostensibly expert opinions, never questioning the fact that he managed to produce evidence with a certainty that other lab technicians couldn\u2019t approach. This faith in Zain\u2019s abilities sent untold numbers of innocent men behind bars, primarily for rape and murder charges. While some of those men were exonerated, the exact number of cases influenced by Zain is unknowable. And, from what is known, it\u2019s clear that Zain\u2019s dissembling reach was tremendous.<\/p> <p>In West Virginia alone, Zain may have lied in as many as 182 different cases. And in addition to his work in a Texas crime lab, Zain served as a forensics consultant to 10 other states, creating the possibility that he lied across thousands of primarily rape and murder trials. As one would expect, the costs of cleaning up after the trail of investigative mayhem have been astronomical. West Virginia alone paid $6.5 million in compensation to innocent people convicted by Zain\u2019s deception, and the state of Texas shelled out $850,000.<\/p> <p>For Zain\u2019s many victims, exoneration and compensation are the only justice possible. Fred Zain died of cancer after the first attempt at holding him accountable for his misdeeds ended in mistrial, and before retrial could begin. One can only hope that, in time, his legacy will evolve into one of wrongs righted by a wiser justice system, rather than the virulent injustices he authored.<\/p> <p>9 FBI Agent Repeatedly Steals And Fails To Report Evidence<\/p> <p>Though movies and media headlines have taught society to view police officers with an ample (but arguably healthy dose) of suspicion, pop culture\u2019s treatment of the FBI has been comparatively favorable. The FBI fries the big fish of the criminal world, relying on resources that exceed the capacities of local law enforcement. And a certain heightened credibility comes with that. But, when an agent like Matthew Lowry is caught getting high on heroin that he stole from an FBI crime lab, that credence suffers greatly.<\/p> <p>The son of a Sunday school teacher, a long-time law enforcement officer, and an honors graduate of the FBI Academy, Lowry was not exactly the spitting image of drug addiction. Yet, at some point during his five years as a Washington, D.C. FBI agent, he lost his way and was eventually found at the wheel of an FBI vehicle under the influence of drugs. In that moment, Lowry single-handedly torpedoed the prosecutions of at least 28 alleged drug offenders, many of whom are thought to be part of dangerous gangs, and he potentially compromised an additional 150 cases. While he has not been charged yet, he has been suspended while the authorities investigate these allegations.<\/p> <p>The bulk of Lowry\u2019s offenses entailed checking out drugs stored at the FBI lab as trial evidence, and returning them with altered weights after days, and sometimes months, of delay. But, in at least one other instance, he failed to submit marijuana and guns seized during a crime, and there is some cause to believe that he may have been involved in the displacement of $130,000 confiscated during an FBI search. But, like so many corruption cases, Lowry\u2019s greatest crime may not be one which exists on any US law book.<\/p> <p>Lowry\u2019s unchecked indiscretions fly in the face of claims that the FBI has a rigorous drug testing policy and raise numerous questions about why the length of time he held onto evidence wasn\u2019t questioned, ultimately implicating the FBI as an irresponsible actor. As the defense attorney for an alleged narcotics kingpin opined, \u201cIt stands to reason that the strict chain of custody claimed by the government in most cases is a sham.\u201d<\/p> <p>8 CSI Chief Tilts Murder Scene Evidence In Favor Of the Prosecution<\/p> <p>The abbreviation \u201cCSI\u201d has become a household term to capture the magic of Hollywood\u2019s high-tech vision of forensic work. But, for residents of Douglas County, Nebraska, those three letters could just as easily stand for \u201cCriminal Subterfuge in Investigations\u201d thanks to disgraced David Kofoed, whose tenure as chief of the local CSI division was marred by the willful manipulation of DNA evidence in a series of murder cases.<\/p> <p>The case, which earned Kofoed his first and greatest encounter with infamy, revolved around the suspects in a double murder: Nicolas Sampson and Matt Livers. Over the course of an 11-hour interrogation, local authorities managed to force a false confession from Livers, who is mentally disabled and eventually buckled under the pressure and repeated threats of incarceration.<\/p> <p>To buttress law enforcement accusations, Kofoed planted traces of blood which tied the suspects to the murder scene, ultimately securing a guilty verdict in court. However, additional evidence later led authorities to the actual perpetrators of the double homicide and exposed Kofoed\u2019s deception.<\/p> <p>The retribution was prompt and costly. In addition to spending more than two years in prison for his misdeeds, Kofoed was slapped with a lawsuit for playing God with Sampson\u2019s and Livers\u2019s lives. A civil court awarded the plaintiffs a total of $6.5 million\u2014a gesture which is more symbolic than practical in light of Kofoed\u2019s inability to pay the fine.<\/p> <p>Subsequent exploration of Kofoed\u2019s other cases revealed a pattern of dubious handiwork. In 2003, Kofoed linked Ivan Henk to the murder of four-year-old Brendan Gonzales with what was likely a manufactured blood sample that prompted Henk\u2019s arrest and eventual guilty plea. In 2006, he faked DNA evidence that was used to solve the murder of Jessica O\u2019Grady. On the the basis of falsified evidence, her presumed killer, Christopher Edwards, may now have legal grounds to overturn an otherwise convincing murder conviction. Ironically, the work of a man determined to secure criminal convictions, regardless of innocence, may allow an apparently guilty man to go free.<\/p> <p>7 Sex Crimes Investigators Alter And Neglect Evidence In Over A Dozen Rape Cases<\/p> <p>Second only to Sherlock Holmes and Batman, Scotland Yard is what people associate with excellence in detective work. And, for a time, its Sapphire sex crimes unit was expected to be no exception. But when the unit faced blistering criticism over a barrage of bungles that allowed a prolific rapist to prey on more than 70 women and another to victimize up to 102 people, a number of Sapphire investigators categorized cases incorrectly, attempting to artificially reduce the number of unsolved sexual assaults.<\/p> <p>According to a 2010 investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), a detective constable and two trainees revised the statement of a rape survivor to suggest that she had retracted her claims. This blatant falsification of a crime report, the IPCC found, was part of a concerted effort by senior officials in the Sapphire unit to improve the rate of solved rape cases in part by recording a higher number of non-offenses.<\/p> <p>The grim implications of such a callous disregard for the law were clear: In order to improve the Sapphire unit\u2019s image, these three men were willing to deny victims justice and permit violent predators to roam free among the vulnerable. And they weren\u2019t alone in this scandal.<\/p> <p>In a separate, more jarring, example of wanton duplicity, detective constable Ryan Coleman-Farrow, another member of the allegedly elite Sapphire unit, simply declined to pursue the claims of at least 12 women who reported sexual assaults between 2007 and 2010. Over the course of this three-year period, Coleman-Farrow not only neglected to interview suspects, but also forged victim statements, allowed video evidence to remain untouched, and failed to bring forensic evidence to the proper channels. As a result, the cases against 11 suspected rapists have gone cold, perhaps never to be solved.<\/p> <p>In the face of brazen inaction by Scotland Yard\u2019s sex crimes investigators, a drastic rejiggering of the force followed. The Sapphire unit was merged with the Metropolitan police force\u2019s child abuse division, and bolstered with 100 additional officers in what was essentially a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d for what was supposed to be a world-class collection of crime solvers.<\/p> <p>6 New York Police Plant Drugs On Innocent People To Fill Arrest Quotas<\/p> <p>In 2008, Brooklyn cops were caught siphoning off drugs confiscated in arrests which, for many observers, would constitute a textbook case of crooked policing. But, according to law enforcement, those drugs were being used to pay informants for information that would lead to major arrests in a case of \u201cnoble cause corruption.\u201d Three years later, the public was blindsided by the news that the tale of evil woven by New York\u2019s finest was also a cover for the intentional arrest of innocent people.<\/p> <p>In hindsight, one might characterize the scandal as a logical offshoot of the very system which condemns its criminality. With police performance measured in numbers of arrests, officers who failed to book enough criminals risked such penalties as being removed from undercover assignments. According to Officer Steve Anderson, who himself was caught partaking in the scheme, this translated into undercover narcotics agents handing over some of the drugs purchased during covert operations to officers who were struggling to meet arrest quotas. Those struggling used the extra drugs to frame innocent people.<\/p> <p>Anderson\u2019s account of the illegal evidence planting operation wasn\u2019t enough to convict every officer he claimed had framed innocent people to pad their arrest numbers. But the evidence of his wrongdoing, along with the actions of other Brooklyn officers, was enough to throw out 400 different drug cases and secure the release of over two dozen people wrongfully arrested on drug charges. In addition to bearing the financial burden of revisiting tainted convictions, the government has agreed to award $1,000 for each hour of wrongful incarceration endured by an innocent person, leading to compensation for at least 25 people believed to have been booked on bad evidence.<\/p> <p>Some costs, however, may be incalculable. The reputation of Brooklyn\u2019s officers has been doubly besmirched, as not only had they likely been arresting innocent people for years as a matter of convenience, but they covered up that behavior by casting themselves as heroic wrongdoers when, in reality, they were simply doing wrong.<\/p> <p>5 New York State Troopers Fake Fingerprint Evidence For Nearly A Decade<\/p> <p>In 1989, the Harris family of Dryden, New York became the victims of a grisly murder. The family of four was bound and gagged, a 15-year-old female raped and tortured, and the whole family shot in the head before their home was set on fire. Two people were convicted and imprisoned for that brutal affair: Michael Kinge and his mother, Shirley.<\/p> <p>But, after spending two and a half years of a 17- to 44-year sentence behind bars for burglary and arson, Shirley Kinge was released. Fingerprint evidence that tied her to gasoline cans used in the arson had been planted by New York State Troopers.<\/p> <p>Shirley Kinge\u2019s plight was one of at least 36 instances of evidence planting perpetrated by members of the New York State Troopers\u2019 C Division and at least one member of Troop F. Between 1984 and 1992, members of New York State Troopers\u2019 C Division, and at least one member of Troop F, systematically fabricated fingerprints and other evidence. And, for those eight years\u2014which is a long time to get away with any crime\u2014those troopers helped decide thousands of felony cases across more than half a dozen counties across New York.<\/p> <p>At the heart of the scandal were five forensic investigators from Troop C. According to investigators, these individuals benefited from a culture of lax, and even tacitly complicit, oversight that nurtured a felonious hubris. A sixth officer, situated in Troop F, had long known the other five perpetrators and undoubtedly shared in their criminal nonchalance, even planting evidence in one instance where a conviction would have been secured without it.<\/p> <p>Troop C\u2019s incorrigible corruption might have gone unchecked were it not for a miscalculation by former trooper David Harding. While interviewing with the CIA, Harding touted his evidence planting exploits as an example of his ability to conduct covert operations, somehow failing to comprehend that admitting to a string of serious crimes might get him in trouble with the government. The ensuing investigation resulted in guilty pleas from five troopers and a criminal conviction of the sixth. But perhaps the most significant outcome was a rule change requiring more rigorous checks to confirm fingerprint evidence.<\/p> <p>4 Delaware Drug Lab Compromises Thousands Of Cases Through Sloppiness And Theft<\/p> <p>In January 2014\u2014mere weeks after the world welcomed a new year with celebratory optimism\u2014prosecutors throughout Delaware faced a legal nightmare that would haunt the foreseeable future. It began during the trial of a suspected Oxycontin dealer, when the court discovered that confiscated drugs had vanished and been replaced with heart medication. In the months that followed, investigators revealed a pattern of malfeasance and unprofessionalism that would tax and tarnish Delaware\u2019s criminal proceedings.<\/p> <p>Between 2010 and 2012, there were over 50 thefts from the state Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. Sometimes, the stolen items were replaced with false evidence. But, in truth, the lab had been plagued by corruption long before those thefts ever occurred. And a big part of the problem could be pinned on the man running the show: Chief Medical Examiner Richard Callery.<\/p> <p>Helmsman of the drug lab for nearly two decades, and himself suspected of professional improprieties, Callery had overseen a spate of irresponsible hiring decisions. One of the drug thieves, James Woodson, was hired despite allegations that he had stolen evidence from the New Castle Police Department in Delaware. In 2006, the lab rehired a forensic analyst who previously resigned under suspicion of falsifying data. And, in another case of negligence, Callery failed to fire a chemist who had failed required proficiency tests.<\/p> <p>With a team of criminals and incompetents running the drug lab, unconscionable misconduct ensued. For 14 years, the lab relied on malfunctioning equipment that incorrectly logged all evidence entry dates as January 1, 1970. In another instance, a former employee had managed to hold onto an evidence locker pass key six years after leaving the job. And some of the lab\u2019s forensic data is believed to have been falsified. The overwhelming evidence of lab misconduct has already resulted in the dismissal of 200 drug cases and reduced sentences in 60 more. But that\u2019s only the beginning. An additional 500 convictions are slated to be challenged with thousands more in the works.<\/p> <p>3 The Philadelphia PD\u2019s Narcotics Unit Resembles A Mafia Operation<\/p> <p>Every city has ignominious chapters in its history that it would rather forget. For Philadelphia, one of those chapters is undoubtedly devoted to its 39th district police officers. In a scandal that broke on the heels of extensive efforts to reform Philadelphia\u2019s habitually corrupt police force, the officers of the 39th shocked the conscience of Philadelphia with tales of false arrests, evidence tampering, violence, and even theft.<\/p> <p>Everyone from criminals to harmless grandmothers were targets of the 39th district, as feared figures like the infamous John Baird ran roughshod over mostly poor black citizens with virtual legal impunity for years. Individuals like 54-year-old Betty Patterson spent three years in prison on false charges of selling cocaine thanks to planted evidence. Over the course of a 14-year career, Baird was the target of nearly two dozen official complaints related to his propensity for police brutality, inflated criminal charges, robbing drug dealers, and the wholesale planting of narcotic evidence on innocent people\u2014an impressive list of evils to say the least.<\/p> <p>But, despite even the presence of eyewitnesses who could attest to grotesque law enforcement misconduct, charges leveled against Baird and other officers were consistently dismissed as baseless until Philadelphia investigators and federal agents finally began pursuing the matter in 1991. The exploits of the 39th district eventually made media headlines in the mid-1990s. In the years that followed, more than 1,400 cases were reviewed, hundreds of convictions overturned, and $5 million in compensation was awarded to victims of the police. In addition, eight officers were ultimately convicted for their crimes, reversing a longstanding trend of wrongfully incarcerating innocent people in the city of the Liberty Bell.<\/p> <p>But, despite the laudable efforts of local and federal officials to stem the tide of narcotic officer corruption in Philadelphia, rampant corruption is alive and well on the streets of Philadelphia. In 2014, a group of police officers was apprehended after executing a vicious extortion plot that involved kidnapping, threats, and even holding criminal suspects out of windows. Apparently, old habits die hard.<\/p> <p>2 Houston Crime Lab Has A Long History Of Shoddy Lab Work And Biased Testimony<\/p> <p>In the state of Texas, America\u2019s death penalty capital, forensic analysts weighing in on cases of rape and murder literally tip the scales in favor of life or death for a defendant. It\u2019s a grim burden that grows ever heavier in light of the fact that, for decades, the Houston Police Department crime lab has relied on faulty DNA analyses and bogus courtroom testimony that, according to a lab director, have tainted at least 5,000 to 10,000 cases.<\/p> <p>Forensic analyst James Bolding demonstrated overwhelming incompetence and willful dishonesty in his work, appearing not to grasp even the basics of blood sample analysis, while providing courtroom testimony that wrongfully imprisoned men like George Rodriguez, who languished behind bars for 17 years for a rape he didn\u2019t commit, and Josiah Sutton, who was wrongly incarcerated for four years.<\/p> <p>Bolding, and the hundreds of cases he compromised, were emblematic of a culture of inadequacy at the Houston crime lab, where numerous technicians knowingly conducted unreliable analyses in a lab which itself was woefully sub-par. Disorganization was rife, and records were regularly falsified. Even before the shoddy evidence testing began, samples were often contaminated via a leaky roof.<\/p> <p>With examples of misconduct extending into the 1980s, the Houston crime lab precipitated a lengthy reign of errors that has led to two mandatory shutdowns. In 2002, the facility was closed due to unacceptably shoddy lab work and, in 2008, an internal affairs probe uncovered evidence of cheating on lab proficiency tests, resulting in a second closure.<\/p> <p>Then, 2014 brought yet another wave of criticism when another forensic analyst resigned after revelations that he eschewed lab protocols and falsified official records, casting an all-too-familiar doubt on roughly 180 criminal cases.<\/p> <p>With the rate of laboratory malfeasance far outpacing the capacity of authorities to address it, we may never fully ascertain just how many lives were ruined or potentially lost thanks to the Houston Police Department\u2019s forensic infractions. But the sheer scale of ineptitude and invalidation wrought by this crime lab arguably rivals the grievous nature of the crimes it was tasked with solving.<\/p> <p>1 Lab Tech Annie Dookhan Faked Up To 60,000 Drug Sample Analyses<\/p> <p>For nine years, Annie Dookhan worked as a crime lab chemist in Massachusetts, performing drug tests for criminal cases. And, in that capacity, she seemingly set a bar for excellence that was prohibitively high. Over her career, Dookhan completed as many as 60,000 analyses, making her partly responsible for an estimated 11,000 criminal convictions. All the while, she outpaced her colleagues in productivity, sometimes by a factor of three. Unfortunately, Dookhan wasn\u2019t some laboratory wunderkind with a passion for drug offenses. In fact, she didn\u2019t even have the master\u2019s degree she claimed to have earned. Rather, she had been faking test results at a rate of thousands per year.<\/p> <p>In some ways, it can be said that Dookhan was just giving her superiors what they wanted. In the results-driven world of laboratory work, her virtually inhuman ability to amass test results placed Dookhan in a position of distinction. Few questioned it when, in 2010, as her lab saw a drastic decrease in the number of drug analyses completed, Dookhan\u2019s output skyrocketed, accounting for an astounding 31 percent of all the evidence processed by her lab\u201410,933 samples in all.<\/p> <p>When she testified on the witness stand to voice her certainty of a defendant\u2019s guilt in a drug case, no one suspected that she was sometimes adding cocaine to evidence samples to produce incriminating results. The consequences of that complacency have been devastating for Massachusetts.<\/p> <p>Since the discovery of Dookhan\u2019s conduct, at least 1,100 criminal cases have been dropped or dismissed and at least $8.5 million has been spent attempting to account for her mountain of faked lab data. In addition to the untold numbers of people who have been convicted on faulty evidence, a fair number of known violent drug offenders have also been released, leading to an increase in the crime rate and time spent rearresting offenders released because of fabricated evidence.<\/p> <p>In the wake of the legal, ethical, and financial chaos wrought by Annie Dookhan, her punishment may strike many as light. After pleading guilty to perjury, obstruction of justice, and evidence tampering, she received a prison sentence of three to five years, followed by two years of probation. In the meantime, the criminal justice system will be left to clean up the countless messes caused by a single person with too much incentive to lie and too little oversight.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"36D1BWBEHPG0UCXSM8EX2CP7KOMM22"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ea7ca118-9f34-4464-9425-0be339155b76","work_time_in_seconds":3027,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"2010","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fred Zain","victim_keywords":"forensics","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ryan Coleman-Farrow","victim_keywords":"detective constable","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Annie Dookhan","victim_keywords":"Chemist","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Richard Callery","victim_keywords":"Chief Medical Examiner","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Michael Kinge","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Shirley","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"2010","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fred Zain","victim_keywords":"forensics","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ryan Coleman-Farrow","victim_keywords":"detective constable","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Annie Dookhan","victim_keywords":"Chemist","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Richard Callery","victim_keywords":"Chief Medical Examiner","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Michael Kinge","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Shirley","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":889569596,"Input.title":"Simon Cheng\u2019s TV \u2018confession\u2019 reveals the truth about China\u2019s coercive legal system","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-28 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By Peter Humphrey<\/p> <p>Last week, I wrote a lengthy article about my fight against Beijing\u2019s abusive practice of using forced and falsified televised confessions extracted from prisoners under duress and torture to pervert the course of justice. I remarked that, since my unprecedented filing of a regulatory complaint against Chinese state television in London last November, China had not paraded another foreigner on TV in this manner.<\/p> <p>In the moment my article was published in The Diplomat magazine, I was proven wrong. They did it again. They aired a crude video clip of Simon Cheng, former UK Consulate worker in Hong Kong, falsely and forcibly \u201cconfessing\u201d to some peculiar alleged crimes. Cheng vanished during a business trip to Shenzhen across the border in August. He was detained incognito and released a fortnight or so later after a diplomatic contest with London.<\/p> <p>Photo: People\u2019s Daily screenshot.<\/p> <p>This broadcast was carried by CGTN, the international offshoot of China Central Television (CCTV), a propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party. It was CCTV and CGTN that I filed a complaint against a year ago over their broadcasts of me locked in a cage forcibly and falsely \u201cconfessing\u201d to crimes I had not committed, in 2013 and 2014.<\/p> <p>The British broadcast regulator Ofcom is still investigating my complaint along with a subsequent complaint filed by Angela Gui, the daughter of publisher Gui Minhai. On Ofcom\u2019s own initiative, it is also investigating CGTN\u2019s broadcasting of fake news about Hong Kong.<\/p> <p>The UK\u2019s broadcasting law, policed by Ofcom, has crystal-clear, black and white provisions on issues of privacy, fairness, factuality and standards of content that must be upheld by all TV outfits licenced by this regulator to broadcast in the UK. CCTV and CGTN hold licences to broadcast on two channels to UK airwaves, and the Simon Cheng fake confession was aired on one of those, China24, while a companion clip was broadcast on CGTN\u2019s YouTube channel.<\/p> <p>Not only did CGTN yet again violate the UK broadcasting code, and equivalent broadcasting laws in other countries, it also violated Chinese law and the Chinese constitution, which, believe it or not, guarantees fair and transparent trials.<\/p> <p>CGTN on social media. Photo: Twitter.<\/p> <p>The Simon Cheng broadcast was intended to counter a slew of articles in the international media revealing that he was tortured, as he was forced to sign false confessions related to soliciting prostitutes. The combating of accurate and factual news in international media about why I had been detained, as well as to falsely incriminate me, was also the reason for my own false TV confession in 2013.<\/p> <p>Apart from being illegal, the Cheng broadcast was also revealing in ways that his Chinese police captors and tormentors may not have realised \u2013 or cared about \u2013 at the time.<\/p> <p>Cheng\u2019s brutal treatment tells us much about the Chinese dictatorship\u2019s approach to justice. His mistreatment, globally decried as a human rights abuse, and his false charge, absolutely typify the Chinese police methodology \u2013 both by the Public Security Bureau (the police) and the Ministry of State Security. It is fully representative of their coercive and abusive legal system. To me, Cheng\u2019s story which he told to media a few days before the CGTN broadcast, is totally credible because \u201cI have been there\u201d.<\/p> <p>The abuse described by Cheng is the pervasive norm of Chinese police behaviour. They know no other way. The Public Security Bureaus and the Ministry of State Security rely exclusively on forcing confessions and statements from detainees and from so-called witnesses to obtain a conviction at any cost. They do not rely on any forensic or real police investigative skills; they rely on menace, duress and torture.<\/p> <p>The entire legal system in China is one of coercive force, not of judicial process.<\/p> <p>An artists\u2019 impression of how Peter Humphrey\u2019s televised confession was set up. Artwork: Alexey Garmash.<\/p> <p>When I was a prisoner, I was interrogated every day by multiple interrogators. During interrogation, I was always locked inside a steel cage, locked into a metal chair, in handcuffs, with no legal counsel present. My thumb was then pressed into red seal ink, forcing me to thumbprint statements that bore little relation to what I had said.<\/p> <p>While in detention, the authorities do everything to crush the human spirit in order to extort a confession, in order to justify a detention that has nothing to do with whatever charge they publicly announce.<\/p> <p>They hold the prisoner in sordid conditions, without civilised hygiene facilities, without heating or air-conditioning, without hot water, without proper nutrition, in crowded unfurnished cells, freezing in winter, like an oven in summer, withholding medical treatment, blocking access to lawyers when it is most needed, barring contact with family, no phone calls, no correspondence, lights on 24\/7 preventing sleep, forced to squat for hours on end, with guards yelling at them all the time.<\/p> <p>Detainees in so-called pre-trial detention centres are subjected to what is effectively a punishment regime from day one and treated as guilty before any charges, indictment or trial, even though China\u2019s own \u201claws\u201d provide for presumption of innocence before proven guilty by a court, a gross fallacy.<\/p> <p>Peter Humphrey\u2019s two confessions on CCTV. Photo: Screenshot.<\/p> <p>With non-citizens, during interrogations, they also often try to get the prisoner to admit to false charges of espionage. They did this to me. Predictably, they did this to Simon Cheng.<\/p> <p>They tried to get him to admit falsely that the UK was funding and organizing the Hong Kong protest movement, code for undermining Chinese national security, a capital offence. With me, they tried to charge me with spying in Xinjiang, because of remarks in a country risk analysis report written by one of my colleagues for our clients. It was pathetic. I resisted and luckily destroyed these accusations very quickly. They have also done this to the two Canadians being held in Beijing for the past year, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.<\/p> <p>When the police grabbed Cheng at the frontier checkpoint turnstiles, they told him \u201cthis is orders from the top\u201d. It is not the norm for a person suspected of soliciting a prostitute to be arrested on \u201corders from the top\u201d, code for high-level Chinese leadership. From the very beginning, this slip of the tongue made it clear this was not about prostitution.<\/p> <p>The police inadvertently disclosed that the charge against Cheng of soliciting prostitution was utter nonsense. Everybody in China knows only the organising of prostitution is a real crime in China. Brothel keepers, pimps and human traffickers who are not protected by the PSB get stiff prison terms. But soliciting a prostitute in China is a minor offence that usually earns a smack on the hand, just a few weeks in detention, and usually does not go to court.<\/p> <p>The exception is when the detainee has been a special target of the regime all along, or the target of some kind of revenge action by somebody with friends in the police, and then the prostitution charge is just a pretext for victimisation.<\/p> <p>A collage of forced confessions. Photo: Handout.<\/p> <p>That was so when the critical American political blogger Charles Xue Manzi was paraded on Chinese television in 2013. And this is the case with Cheng. He was targeted as a means to attack the UK, a critic of the harsh anti-democracy crackdown in Hong Kong.<\/p> <p>In addition, the authorities as reported by CGTN have admitted they had him under surveillance for days. The PSB never expend such resources on somebody who is just suspected of visiting prostitutes. They would only go to this effort if the person was a target for some other reason.<\/p> <p>In this case, he was surveilled because they wanted a pretext to arrest and rough up someone working for the British. In other words, he was a scapegoat and instrument in an attack on the UK. He was singled out because of his employment at the Consulate. His detention was classic Chinese diplomatic-hostage taking aimed at punishing Hong Kong\u2019s former master.<\/p> <p>The CGTN footage from surveillance video showed Cheng transacting at a reception desk and following a woman down a corridor and into a room. If this was indeed a brothel, it begs the question how and why it exists after President Xi Jinping ordered a crackdown against prostitution after coming to power in late 2012. How on earth can such a brothel still exist if President Xi shut them all down and if prostitution is illegal?<\/p> <p>Photo: People\u2019s Daily screenshot.<\/p> <p>The answer is plain. Every Chinese knows that most brothels are either owned by or protected by police, and the crackdown left many or most of them untouched. Neither CGTN nor the authorities have explained why it was not the brothel that was subjected to \u201clegal action\u201d but one particular visitor among the thousands who use this house of ill repute every month.<\/p> <p>What China has done through this incident, aided and abetted by state television, is to prove for the world to see that there is no transparency, fairness or genuine due process in China.<\/p> <p>Former British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called on the UK government to issue a British passport to Simon Cheng because his life is now in danger.<\/p> <p>I would also urge Ofcom to investigate Cheng\u2019s subjection to forced and falsified televised confession aired by CGTN on UK airwaves.<\/p> <p>Peter Humphrey has been a China specialist for 44 years.

The police spokesperson also distanced himself from his earlier admission that they had arrested the three women.<\/p> <p>Fortunately, the car they had been driving on the day of the protest was found parked at Harare central police station, so we knew the police were lying.<\/p> <p>Zimbabweans took to Twitter and other media platforms to call for the immediate release of the women, undoubtedly victims of enforced disappearance. There has been a systematic and widespread use of abductions and enforced disappearance by the state on dissidents.<\/p> <p>On 15 May, two nights after their disappearance, the three women were found dumped on a roadside near Bindura about 86km from Harare, traumatised and seriously injured. They were admitted to hospital for treatment. Zimbabweans were relieved when we heard they had been found. We thought their troubles were over, but it seems they were just beginning.<\/p> <p>The women narrated their ordeal and in tears explained how after their arrest they had been abducted from police custody by armed men and taken to a forest where for two days they were physically and sexually assaulted and forced to perform humiliating and degrading acts such as drinking one another\u2019s urine.<\/p> <p>While still in hospital, on 26 May, they were charged with \u201cinciting public violence\u201d. A magistrate went to the hospital to hear the matter and a kangaroo court-style hearing was held at their hospital bedsides. Zimbabweans were outraged by the brazen continuation of the victimisation of these women, who had already been tortured. They were granted bail for that charge 29 May.<\/p> <p>On 8 June they were discharged from hospital to finish their recovery at home. As they were attempting to pick up their lives after the traumatic experiences, just two days after they were discharged, on 10 June, they were arrested again and this time charged with faking abduction. They were sent to Chikurubi maximum prison only to be granted bail by the high court more than two weeks later on 26 June.<\/p> <p>It is clear that the state is hellbent on forcing the MDC Three to face trial despite their mental health challenges. Everything that is happening to them is not because they broke any laws, but persecution for daring to question the government on how it used Covid-19 donations.<\/p> <p>The bail conditions barred them from using social media, they were to report to police three times a week and they had to surrender their passports and pay Z$10,000 (about $100).<\/p> <p>They were also banned from talking to the media. The media ban has meant that the world has no access to the finer details of the lengths to which Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government has gone to abuse the women. There were rumours that all three were struggling with depression, anxiety and other stress- and trauma-induced conditions. Through it all, they observed their bail conditions religiously. They have not given any interviews, they have not participated in public gatherings and they have been reporting to the police three times weekly as stipulated.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, that has not prevented the state from victimising them further.<\/p> <p>On 4 September, Mamombe had a psychological breakdown which saw her admitted to a mental institution. She was diagnosed with anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.<\/p> <p>While in hospital she missed a court hearing for her ongoing trial of faking an abduction. Her lawyers explained to the magistrate that she was in hospital and therefore could not attend the hearing, but the magistrate would have none of it. On 15 September, police brandishing an arrest warrant descended on Mamombe and forcibly discharged her from hospital in her nightwear, despite pleas from her doctors to allow her to continue treatment.<\/p> <p>On 24 September, to our disbelief and shock, a magistrate by the name of Bianca Makwande ordered that Mamombe be sent back to Chikurubi maximum prison for 14 days on the pretext that she had to be assessed by two state psychiatrists to see if she could stand trial. She was housed in the mental health section of Chikurubi maximum prison where the sickest members of the country are imprisoned. This is where the criminally insane are housed.<\/p> <p>It is reported that on the day she was admitted they tried to inject her with an unknown substance, but she violently protested until they let her go. I believe the government put her there in a bid to drive her insane and thus have an excuse to commit her to a mental asylum.<\/p> <p>Mamombe was released through a high court order on 7 October, but after having already spent 13 days in prison. The assessments by the doctors at a hearing held on 22 October 2020 indicate that Mamombe is not ready for trial and needs medical attention.<\/p> <p>When I heard the news I believed it was good news, but unbeknown to everyone the state had something up its sleeve. Instead of waiting until Mamombe is well enough to stand trial, they say they now want to separate the trials of the MDC Three by trying Mamombe separately from her co-accused. This seems like a clear attempt to frustrate Mamombe further and to isolate her from the support and solidarity she shares with her co-accused. It also ignores the fact that the other two victims are also struggling with anxiety, depression and other mental health issues.<\/p> <p>In December 2019, in the case of the State vs former Minister Prisca Mupfumira who is facing corruption charges involving theft of $95-million in pensioners\u2019 funds, Prisca\u2019s lawyer told the court that she was not mentally fit for trial. A psychiatrist had recommended that she be given three months to recover. The court granted her request and till today, she is free.<\/p> <p>It is clear that the state is hellbent on forcing the MDC Three to face trial despite their mental health challenges. Everything that is happening to them is not because they broke any laws, but persecution for daring to question the government on how it used Covid-19 donations.<\/p> <p>It is important that the world takes an interest in the case of these three women, victims of torture, enforced disappearance, persecution, grave forms of sexual violence, imprisonment and other inhuman acts; all crimes against humanity, according to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Article 7.<\/p> <p>Today, Friday 23 October, the court will give its ruling. I pray we all take a keen interest.<\/p> <p>What kind of people would we be, what kind of world would this be, if all of us, Zimbabweans and citizens of the world, human rights defenders, women\u2019s organisations, mental health organisations, political parties, civil society organisations, neighbouring and other countries, allow the government of Zimbabwe to continue these gross violations of human rights, unchecked?

The centers are euphemistically portrayed as inviting learning camps equipped with volleyball courts and ping-pong tables. However, newly obtained tender documents show that those interned inside the camps are treated more like prisoners than students. In addition to textbooks, items listed on local government shopping lists and procurement outlays for the facilities include tear gas, tasers, police batons, and handcuffs. Ben Dooley at AFP reports:<\/p> <p>Around April 2017, local governments began posting a wide variety of tenders related to the facilities. Some orders \u2014 furniture, air conditioners, bunk beds, cutlery \u2014 would not seem out of place at a typical Chinese university. But others resembled prison equipment: sophisticated surveillance systems, cameras for recording students in their rooms, razor wire, a system for eavesdropping on phone calls, and infrared monitoring devices. The centres also bought police uniforms, riot shields and helmets, pepper spray, tear gas, net guns, stun guns, electrified batons, billy clubs, spears, handcuffs and spiked clubs known as \u201cwolf\u2019s teeth\u201d. At least one centre requested \u201ctiger chairs\u201d, a device used by Chinese police to restrain interrogation subjects.

[Source]<\/p> <p>A BBC investigation using satellite images from Google Earth and aerospace company GMV has found evidence of a rapidly expanding web of detention facilities. Extensive construction activities can be traced across Xinjiang that point to the remarkable speed at which officials are building the physical infrastructure to hold Muslims without trial. From John Sudworth:<\/p> <p>There is a striking conclusion \u2013 the recent trend is towards larger facilities. [\u2026] GMV calculates that, from this set of 44 sites alone, the surface area of secure facilities in Xinjiang has expanded by some 440 hectares since 2003. [\u2026] We took one of GMV\u2019s findings \u2013 the increase in building size at the facility in Dabancheng \u2013 and showed it to a team with long experience in prison design at the Australian-based Guymer Bailey Architects. Using the measurements from the satellite images they calculated that, at an absolute minimum, the facility could provide space for about 11,000 detainees. Even that minimum estimate would place it alongside some of the biggest prisons in the world.

In the mornings, they would sing together at daily flag-raising ceremonies outside the village Party office, at night they would attend classes on Xi Jinping\u2019s vision for a \u201cNew China.\u201d The teaching of \u201cculture\u201d would suffuse all the time in between. They would converse in Mandarin and watch approved TV, practice Chinese calligraphy, and sing patriotic songs. And all the while the \u201crelatives\u201d would be watching the villagers and taking notes, assessing the Uighurs\u2019 level of loyalty to their country, noting how well they spoke Chinese, staying alert for signs that their attachment to Islam might be \u201cextreme.\u201d Had a Uighur host just greeted a neighbor in Arabic with the words \u201cAssalamu Alaykum\u201d? That would need to go in the notebook. Was that a copy of the Quran in the home? Was anyone praying on Friday or fasting during Ramadan? Was a little sister\u2019s dress too long or a little brother\u2019s beard irregular? And why was no one playing cards or watching movies? [\u2026] The \u201crelatives\u201d have been essentially conscripted into service in three separate waves. The first campaign started in 2014, dispatching some 200,000 Party members, including minority Party members, to \u201cVisit the People, Benefit the People, and Bring Together the Hearts of the People\u201d (fang minqing, hui minsheng, ju minxin, \u8bbf\u6c11\u60c5\u3001\u60e0\u6c11\u751f\u3001\u805a\u6c11\u5fc3)\u2014through long-term stays in Uighur villages. In 2016, a second wave of 110,000 civil servants were sent into Uighur villages as part of a \u201cUnited as One Family\u201d (jie dui renqin, \u7ed3\u5bf9\u8ba4\u4eb2) campaign which focused on placing \u201crelatives\u201d in the homes of Uighurs whose family members had been imprisoned or killed by the police. [Source]<\/p> <p>The systemic persecution of Uyghur intellectuals in Xinjiang has been documented in SAR\u2019s Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. It illustrates how Uyghur scholars and students have become primary targets of the Chinese state under the current crackdown. From the Uyghur Human Rights Project:<\/p> <p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has frequently targeted Uyghur academics, students, and artists, including noted scholar Ilham Tohti, in a bid to silence dissenting views to repressive state policies. However, the latest persecution of intellectuals represents a significant escalation of ethnic suppression, as even Uyghurs loyal to the state and party are now subject to absurd allegations, such as harboring separatist tendencies, and labeled as \u201ctwo-faced.\u201d Those disappeared and believed to be held in the camps include Rahile Dawut, an internationally known folklorist, literature professors Abdukerim Rahman, Azat Sultan and Gheyretjan Osman, language professor Arslan Abdulla and poet Abdulqadir Jalaleddin. High ranking university administrators such as Kashgar University\u2019s president Erkin Omer and vice president Muhter Abdughopur have been removed from their posts and their whereabouts are unknown, while others such as Halmurat Ghopur, former president of Xinjiang Medical University Hospital and former president of Xinjiang University Tashpolat Tiyip have received suspended death sentences. Other prominent figures have already died in the camps, including the religious scholars Muhammad Salih Hajim and Abdulnehed Mehsum. The disappearances of Uyghur intellectuals belie the Chinese government\u2019s assertions that the \u201cre-education\u201d campaign is an effort to de-radicalize the population and combat terrorism. Instead it is part of a coordinated effort to undermine and eliminate a distinct Uyghur identity as rapidly as possible in an unprecedentedly aggressive forced assimilation campaign. UHRP calls on the government of China to immediately release all scholars, writers, artists, and students arbitrarily detained and at risk of harsh mistreatment, including torture. UHRP urges governments and academic institutions around the world to vigorously press the Chinese government for information about the whereabouts and well-being of disappeared and detained academics and intellectuals.

These cases raise the question of what kind of treatment Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo received before his death in July 2017 due to complications from liver cancer. Chinese security agents and propaganda officials went into overdrive before and after his death, attempting to paint a picture that Liu received the best available medical care. However, during Liu\u2019s seven years at Jinzhou Prison in Liaoning Province, authorities knew that Liu had hepatitis B, a disease that put him at greater risk for liver cancer. Yet, Liu\u2019s cancer was so advanced when he was granted medical parole and moved to a hospital that no surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy could be performed, according to his wife, the poet Liu Xia.<\/p> <p>Chinese law mandates that prisoners and individuals held in detention facilities receive prompt medical care; however, the reality is often far removed from the law. Deliberately depriving prisoners of medical care is a life-threatening form of torture, and appears to be commonly used against political prisoners on China. Many of these cases follow a similar pattern, starting with a decline in health from existing conditions or new injuries emerging due to torture or ill-treatment, denied access to adequate and prompt medical care, and a refusal to approve applications for medical bail or parole. Family members worry that the government will simply let their loved ones die behind bars; the death of China\u2019s most famous political prisoner in police custody only strengthens that fear.<\/p> <p>Another pressing case of deprived medical treatment is that of rural women\u2019s rights activist Su Changlan. Su was detained in 2014 after posting social media messages in support of the Occupy Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Authorities in Guangdong\u2019s Foshan City arrested and charged Su with \u201cinciting subversion of state power,\u201d accusing her of trying to \u201coverthrow the socialist system\u201d with her articles and comments on WeChat. Su suffers from hyperthyroidism, which can be fatal if not treated. In custody, she has suffered from complications from a lack of treatment, including heart arrhythmia, trembling hands, swollen eyes, weight loss, and incontinence. Su told her lawyers in meetings throughout 2015 and 2016 about the poor or non-existent medical care she had been receiving, as well as the poor hygiene and living conditions.<\/p> <p>Conversation Liu Xiaobo, 1955-2017 Perry Link, Thomas Kellogg & more When news this morning reached us that Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo had died, we invited all past contributors to the ChinaFile Conversation to reflect on his life and on his death. Liu died, still in state-custody, eight years into his 11-...<\/p> <p>For more than two years, authorities repeatedly denied her lawyers\u2019 applications to secure her release on medical bail. In March 2017, Su was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. Su\u2019s health continued to dangerously deteriorate after her conviction, and she now reportedly suffers from possible kidney failure and is having difficulty speaking. Her husband, who visited her on June 2017\u2014the first time that officials allowed him such a visit\u2014told journalists, \u201cHer health is much, much worse than it was before.\u201d Su\u2019s family fears her life is in danger and she won\u2019t receive better treatment until she is released in October 2017.<\/p> <p>The risk of death from deprived medical care is very real. On March 14, 2014, human rights activist Cao Shunli died after being deprived of medical treatment for over six months in a Beijing detention center. Police seized Cao, who had several manageable health conditions, in September 2013 to prevent her from traveling to Geneva to testify to the U.N. Human Rights Council about the human rights situation in China. Cao had a liver condition that she had managed in the past, but guards reportedly confiscated medication that she had with her. While Cao was held in a detention center, her health began to deteriorate, but authorities refused to approve her lawyers\u2019 requests for medical bail. It was not until she was practically in a coma that bail was approved, and Cao died from organ failure only 22 days later. Other individuals who challenged the government and have died after being deprived of medical care in custody include petitioner-activists Chen Xiaoming and Duan Huimin in the mid-2000s, and more recently Tibetans Goshul Lobsang and Tenzin Delek Rinpoche.<\/p> <p>The international community has spoken out about deprivation of medical treatment as a form of torture used against China\u2019s political prisoners. U.N. human rights experts, in calling on China to provide adequate medical care for activist Guo Feixiong in August 2016, felt that, \u201cHis public profile as a human rights defender seems to have been the cause and aggravating factor for the denial of appropriate medical care and ill-treatment.\u201d<\/p> <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to \u201cgovern the country according to the law,\u201d but the pattern of deprived medical care shows a disregard for the lives of human rights defenders and a lack of rule of law. Legislation requiring \u201cprompt medical treatment\u201d are not implemented, and other regulations and rules are deficient because they don\u2019t contain legal guarantees that doctors in prisons or detention facilities can make independent medical decisions without interference from either law-enforcement or Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) officials.<\/p> <p>The NYRB China Archive China: A Life in Detention Yang Zhanqing from New York Review of Books Every year in China, thousands of people suffer what the United Nations calls \u201carbitrary detention\u201d: confinement in extra-legal facilities\u2014including former government buildings, hotels, or mental hospitals\u2014which are sometimes known as \u201cblack jails...<\/p> <p>Under the Regulations on Detention Facilities, detainees are only guaranteed a medical examination upon entering the detention facility. A request for treatment outside the facility must be approved by the head of the detention center, allowing for arbitrary decision-making in \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d cases. The new draft Detention Center Law doesn\u2019t contain any new language that would ensure prompt, impartial, and comprehensive medical treatment, exposing the government\u2019s failure to act to end this disturbing trend. Though prisoners receive periodic medical checks, in practice exams are only required to be done once a year, and they may not be comprehensive or timely enough to detect health problems.<\/p> <p>Securing release for medical reasons is also difficult. China\u2019s Criminal Procedure Law allows for detainees and prisoners to receive medical bail or parole due to \u201cserious illness.\u201d However, the scope of what constitutes \u201cserious illness\u201d under detailed measures released in 2014 is extremely restrictive and requires some prisoners to endure six months of failed treatment before they can be eligible. Some Chinese lawyers who take on \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d cases have reported that C.C.P. bodies, not medical professionals, must approve applications for medical release.<\/p> <p>China has obligations under international law to ensure prisoners and detainees have access to prompt and adequate medical care, including seeing a doctor of their choice. Since 1988, China has been party to the Convention Against Torture, which bans torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. In December 2015, the U.N. Committee Against Torture raised concern over deaths in Chinese custody as a result of a lack of prompt medical care. A year prior, two other U.N. committees, on economic, social, and cultural rights and on women\u2019s rights, called on China to ensure women in detention and human rights activists are provided with adequate health care in all circumstances, in respect of China\u2019s treaty obligations.<\/p> <p>China\u2019s fellow members on the U.N. Human Rights Council should pressure the government to cooperate with the Council\u2019s own independent human rights experts, who have highlighted concerns over the deprivation of medical care to human rights defenders. Such experts should be allowed, as some have in the past, to independently visit China\u2019s prisons and detention centers to report on the standard and care of medical treatment. Other governments can and should continue to forcefully and publicly call on China to abide by its international obligations on torture and human rights. China\u2019s respect for its responsibilities under international law is a matter of global concern.<\/p> <p>As Dostoevsky famously wrote, \u201cThe degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.\u201d In China, as seen in the cases of Chen Xi, Su Changlan, Cao Shunli, and so many others, the government refuses to behave in a civilized manner when it tortures prisoners of conscience by depriving them access to adequate medical treatment.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"351S7I5UGBB6IQG05UZPE80ORPIJNM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1454,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2012","month":"01","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chen Xi","victim_keywords":"activist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Su Changlan","victim_keywords":"activist, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Cao Shunli","victim_keywords":"activist, deprived, die","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2012","month":"01","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chen Xi","victim_keywords":"activist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Su Changlan","victim_keywords":"activist, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Cao Shunli","victim_keywords":"activist, deprived, die","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}]
