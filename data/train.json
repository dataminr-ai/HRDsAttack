grow","Input.publish_date":"2020-08-29 14:00:45","Input.article_interface":"<p>The protests in Belarus are continuing into their third week. Police are cracking down, detaining protestors, media, and arresting opposition members. Meanwhile, Russia is standing by with a special police \u201creserve\u201d force to move into Belarus if asked by the current regime. And the Russian proxy force of Wagner Group mercenaries has already been involved.<\/p> <p>The protests erupted following what has been roundly criticized as a fraudulent election on August 9th. Lukashenko, according to his own official vote-counters, carried the slate with 80 percent of the vote. President Alexander Lukashenko, a Soviet-style authoritarian leader, who is frequently called \u201cEurope\u2019s Last Dictator,\u201d has been in power since 1994.<\/p> <p>Police at first violently cracked down on the protests that drew about 200,000 people in Minsk. Three people died, hundreds were injured, and 6,700 were arrested. But then Lukashenko let the following protests go on nearly unhindered until Wednesday.<\/p> <p>Yet, that changed. Police detained at least 16 journalists, bringing them to a police station to conduct \u201cidentity checks\u201d and to check whether they had \u201cvalid accreditation.\u201d But many of the European journalists said that is was a blatant attempt to stop the reporting on the huge demonstrations entering their 19th day. Police confiscated journalists\u2019 telephones and identity papers.<\/p> <p>As Belarus\u2019s citizens were waving flags and holding signs reading that Lukashenko must go, security police dispersed the crowds and arrested nearly 200 more people. Lukashenko was shown on Belarus television in a strange video flying over the city of Minsk, wearing black riot gear and brandishing an AK-47. He\u2019s using the tactic of \u201cselective repression\u201d arresting only certain members of the protests to silence calls for his stepping down.<\/p> <p>With the exception of Russia and China, there was worldwide condemnation of the crackdown.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe believe that under the leadership of President Lukashenko, Belarus will restore political stability and social peace,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. He added that China \u201cfirmly opposes interference in Belarus\u2019 internal affairs by external forces.\u201d<\/p> <p>President Putin in Russia is ready to step in and quash the protests. He has said that Belarus President Lukashenko \u201casked me to set up a certain police reserve\u201d and \u201cI have done so.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cWe also agreed that it won\u2019t be used until the situation gets out of control,\u201d Putin said to Rossiya 1TV in an interview. He added that the reserve police forces would not go into Belarus unless \u201cextremist elements using political slogans as cover cross a certain boundary and start armed robbery, setting fire to cars, houses, banks, try to seize government buildings and so forth.\u201d<\/p> <p>Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki condemned Putin\u2019s planned move. Taking to Twitter he said that Poland \u201curges Russia to immediately withdraw from plans of a military intervention in Belarus, under the false excuse of \u2018restoring control\u2019 \u2014 a hostile act, in breach of international law and human rights of Belarusian people, who should be free to decide their own fate.\u201d<\/p> <p>Russian influence and interference are what many in western Europe fear. The special reserve police force that Putin has mentioned will most certainly consist of some members of the FSB and other forces that will be used to suppress the Belarussian people. On Wednesday, an aircraft transported top officials from Russia\u2019s FSB security services to Minsk for the second time in a week. The Kremlin said it had no information as to who was on board or what sort of consultations might have taken place.<\/p> <p>Putin and Lukashenko also are trying to paint the protestors as puppets of the U.S. and the West.<\/p> <p>Yet, Putin now also has to deal with the fallout of the arrest of 33 Wagner Group mercenaries on the eve of the Belarusian election.<\/p> <p>Putin has painted the affair in the media as a joint U.S.-Ukrainian intelligence operation. He said in a television interview with Rossia 24 that the detained Russian mercenaries were tricked into traveling to Belarus with forged documents \u201cfor absolutely legal work in Latin America and the Middle East.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cIn reality, they were dragged into Belarus and presented as a quote-unquote \u2018strike force\u2019 to destabilize the situation during the presidential campaign,\u201d Putin said during the interview.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese people, I repeat, were traveling for work to a third country. They were lured there, dragged across the border\u2026 It was an operation of Ukrainian intelligence agencies together with American ones,\u201d Putin said.<\/p> <p>\u201cOur border agents, by the way, wouldn\u2019t have let them out of the country,\u201d he added. Despite the outrageous charges leveled against the U.S. and Ukraine, Putin offered no proof on how the Americans \u201cduped\u201d Wagner mercs into operating in Belarus.<\/p> <p>Allies of exiled opposition leader, and Lukashenko\u2019s opponent in the August 9th election, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya formed the Coordination Council to oversee the peaceful transition of power. But authorities have been rounding them up and giving them short jail sentences under accusations of trying to seize power.<\/p> <p>Tikhanovskaya has been forced into exile into neighboring Lithuania, fearing for her and her family\u2019s lives. In her only interview with Western journalists, she told the BBC that the protests must go on.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have no right to step back now \u2014 if not now, we\u2019ll be slaves and our people understand this and I\u2019m sure we will stand till the end.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3D1UCPY6GIOAU5R7W7IJG4T46UG83O"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"2303b84d-0115-4284-b9df-e5c53f359001","work_time_in_seconds":586,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"2020.0","month":"08","date":null,"city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Minsk protesters, three people killed, hundreds injured, 6,700 arrested, 200 more arrested","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"16 journalists, detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"33 Wagner Group mercenaries, arrest","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"2020.0","month":"08","date":null,"city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Minsk protesters, three people killed, hundreds injured, 6,700 arrested, 200 more arrested","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"16 journalists, detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"33 Wagner Group mercenaries, arrest","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":959878399,"Input.title":"Union blasts owners of ship formerly detained in Aberdeen Harbour for again attempting to set sail while owing crew wages","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-16 06:25:03","Input.article_interface":"<p>[[title]] [[text]] An error occurred.

Intended as public health measures, these controls inflicted collateral damage.<\/p> <p>The damage included arrests and detention, harassment, extrajudicial killings, destruction of wares, maiming and torture. The controls also trampled on the human rights and economic rights of workers in the informal economy.<\/p> <p>Nigeria\u2019s informal economy accounts for 65% of the country\u2019s total GDP and employs more than 90% of the workforce.<\/p> <p>About 5.58 million people 2.38 million men and 3.2 million women \u2013 make a living in the informal economy of Lagos. This represents about three quarters of the State\u2019s 7.5 million labour force.<\/p> <p>These estimates show that a large percentage of Nigeria\u2019s population depends on the informal economy for their livelihood. It follows that the adverse impact of the COVID-19 control measures on informal workers would be huge. The measures are hard on informal workers because they tend to need to work outside the home every day.<\/p> <p>Our research focused on violations of human rights of informal workers in Nigeria by state actors. We call for an approach to pandemic control that recognises the nuances of local cultures and social economy.<\/p> <p>Studying the state\u2019s actions<\/p> <p>We sourced data from the WHO, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control publications portal, policy documents of the Nigerian government, journal and newspaper articles, blog posts from press briefings and media interviews of government officials.<\/p> <p>During the lockdown, movements were restricted and we couldn\u2019t conduct face-to-face interviews and surveys. Thus we relied on a desk review of literature on COVID-19 control responses.<\/p> <p>At the onset of the first wave of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the government declared a state of emergency. It directed state actors, including security agencies, to take measures necessary to maintain law and order and protect citizens\u2019 lives and property. They were also asked to keep essential public services working, and direct relief materials to the areas of greatest need. State actors enforced restrictions on movement and travel, bans on public gatherings, and closure of markets, businesses and schools.<\/p> <p>Despite the warning by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that states should not violate human rights under the guise of exceptional or emergency measures, some actions of Nigerian security agencies violated the rights of informal workers. Of particular concern were those whose survival depends on daily earnings from outside the home. These include street vendors, petty traders, artisans, cart pushers, waste pickers, commercial motorcycle operators, and roadside motor mechanics.<\/p> <p>The pandemic and the related containment measures worsened various forms of social, cultural and economic exclusion and inequality. This strongly affected vulnerable groups like informal workers.<\/p> <p>Some states in Nigeria such as Abia, Ekiti, Lagos, Kaduna and Rivers recorded incidents of abuse such as destruction of traders\u2019 wares by security operatives enforcing the lockdown policy. Cases were reported where security agencies were implicated in harassment, killings, maiming and torture.<\/p> <p>Public transport services were shut down, leading to loss of income. Informal workers were left with little option than to walk long distances between their homes and places of work. Many who dared to move around were harassed and arrested by the security agencies. These impacts have been captured in media reports.<\/p> <p>The lockdown policy severely reduced income-generating activities for informal workers and presented the dilemma of either \u2018dying from the virus or dying from hunger\u2019.<\/p> <p>Nigeria has a Bill of Rights, and these rights are contained in Chapter IV of the 1999 constitution. They include the right to life, right to dignity, right to personal liberty, right to freedom of movement, and right to freedom of assembly and association. State actors violated these rights under lockdown.<\/p> <p>How state actors got it wrong<\/p> <p>While the Nigeria Police issued some guidelines on enforcement of COVID-19 control measures, it left room for discretionary use of force.<\/p> <p>The guidelines prescribed \u201cuse of force when absolutely necessary and to the extent proportionate to achieve the required result and in accordance with existing national legislation.\u201d They didn\u2019t consider the daily income earners who cannot survive without leaving their homes. Consequently, many Nigerians who obeyed the COVID-19 lockdown policy did not have food and income that their families needed.<\/p> <p>The lockdown also closed schools and disrupted students\u2019 education. While the children of the elite took online lessons and used digital platforms for learning, the children of informal workers had no such opportunity.<\/p> <p>COVID-19 containment programmes raised important legal, constitutional and human rights concerns.<\/p> <p>What we suggest<\/p> <p>Any future lockdown strategies must consider the risks to both lives and livelihoods. Approaches like lockdown and stay-at-home orders may not benefit societies dominated by informal economies.<\/p> <p>We argue that the enforcement of COVID-19 containment policies in Nigeria neglected social structures and the way the local economy works. It undermined the human rights of informal workers who depend on daily social interactions for their livelihood.<\/p> <p>The nuances of culture also should be taken into consideration before large scale adoption of these control practices.

Both protested their innocence. \u201cI want to devote all my energy to the creation of a new Belarus without political repression. I demand an acquittal for myself, for my colleagues, and for the hundreds of political prisoners,\u201d Andreyeva commented in court.<\/p> <p>There was little attempt to present a credible case against the pair.

Email *<\/p> <p>Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.<\/p> <p>The convictions provoked an immediate international reaction. US Senator Jim Risch, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted, \u201cIt is shameful that dictator Lukashenka has jailed two journalists for the \u201ccrime\u201d of filming protests against his fraudulent election in Belarus. These brave women, along with others detained, should be immediately released.\u201d<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, a statement from the European Union\u2019s External Action Service noted that this latest incident was part of a far broader and increasingly alarming trend of repression in Belarus. \u201cThe unacceptable harassment of human rights defenders, media workers, trade union representatives, and defense lawyers has escalated in recent days,\u201d the statement noted. \u201cYesterday, two Belsat journalists were sentenced to two years imprisonment on groundless charges. Other media workers are facing a similar fate. Such verdicts aim to intimidate and silence journalists and media workers who are simply doing their jobs, as well as to prevent factual information from reaching the Belarusian people and beyond.\u201d<\/p> <p>Also this week in Minsk, the trial began of another Belarusian journalist, Kaciaryna Barysevich, who is facing charges alongside Belarusian doctor Arciom Sarokin. Both are accused of exposing regime attempts to cover up the killing of activist Raman Bandarenka, with prosecutors bizarrely arguing that the publication of Bandarenka\u2019s medical records constitutes a technical violation of Belarusian privacy laws. Human rights groups expect the trial to be just as farcical as the charges themselves.<\/p> <p>Repressions against Belarus\u2019s small independent media community have continued in parallel to these court proceedings. Earlier this week, multiple members of the Belarusian Association of Journalists were subjected to dawn raids, with plainclothes law enforcement officers conducting searches of their apartments and confiscating computer equipment.<\/p> <p>The events of the past week represent the latest escalation in a long-running campaign against media professionals in Belarus. The Belarusian Association of Journalists claims that 97 of its members have been sentenced to a collective total of around 1,200 days in prison since the start of the country\u2019s pro-democracy protest movement in August 2020. This number does not include the many more reporters and independent bloggers who have been detained over the past six months before being released without facing any official charges.<\/p> <p>Nor are Andreyeva and Chultsova the only journalists to receive significant prison time. There are currently at least 11 Belarusian journalists imprisoned due to their professional activities, along with various bloggers who have incurred the displeasure of the regime.<\/p> <p>The current challenges facing the media in Belarus are extreme, even by the draconian standards of the 26-year Lukashenka dictatorship. \u201cThe situation with press freedom in Belarus has always been hard and the regime has kept independent media in its crosshairs for years,\u201d explains Minsk journalist and Atlantic Council Nonresident Fellow Hanna Liubakova. \u201cHowever, when the protests began last summer, a very real and nasty war was unleashed against journalists and bloggers in Belarus.\u201d<\/p> <p>Liubakova argues that while the current efforts to silence the Belarusian opposition are alarming, they may ultimately prove futile. \u201cLukashenka and his government do not seem to understand that hiding the truth is impossible in today\u2019s technological era,\u201d she notes. \u201cOrdinary citizens post videos or share them with the media. Others leak information or help out in different ways.\u201d<\/p> <p>This is unlikely to deter Lukashenka from continuing to target media professionals guilty of nothing more than attempting to do their jobs. Belarus is now by any measurement among the most dangerous countries in the region, and likely the entire world, for journalists. Indeed, I myself observed masked security men intimidating journalists by filming them during my own reporting from Minsk last summer.

He fought simultaneously on many fronts for the rights of the Tamil people, especially the non-Brahmins, and to arouse a feeling of self-respect in them. He fought against caste-based discrimination and inequality, sociopolitical hegemony, religious hypocrisy, social evils and customs, suppression of women, Devadasi system, child marriage and ban on widow remarriage. There was hardly a concern which was not his concern. There was hardly any tragic situation he didn\u2019t fight against. He was a businessman, leader, social reformer, thinker, linguist, scientist, rationalist, agitator and guide \u2013 all rolled into one. There was one more dimension to his multi-faceted personality. He was also a journalist and a writer. Most people know little about this aspect of his legacy \u2013 this, when his contribution to the field of journalism is so significant and so original that he can be called \u201cPeriyar\u201d (the great one) even if we forget about all his other contributions. He was associated with newspapers and magazines titled Kudi Arasu (1925), Dravidian (1927), Revolt (1928), Puratchi (1933), Pagutharivu (1934), Viduthalai (1935), Justice (1942), Unmai (1970) and The Modern Rationalist (1971). He launched some of them, edited others. He spent a sizable chunk of his earnings on these newspapers and journals. He lost money in these ventures and was jailed on many occasions for the writings that he published. But he did not allow that to alter his concern. His commitment to human values was unshakeable.<\/p> <p>After parting ways with the Congress in 1925, he laid the foundations of the Self-Respect Movement. As the Brahmin-dominated press didn\u2019t give any space for the issues of the non-Brahmins, he chose journalism to reach out to the people with the ideology and the programmes of the Self-Respect Movement. It began with Kudi Arasu. Here is an overview of the magazines and newspapers edited and published by Periyar:<\/p> <p>Kudi Arasu<\/p> <p>Kudi Arasu, in Tamil, means \u201crule of the people\u201d, that is a republic. Periyar had launched this weekly to take his thinking to the people. The first issue of the magazine came out on 2 May 1925 from Erode. Its first editor was M. Thangaperumal Pillai and the cover price was one ana. The annual subscription was Rs 3. It was printed at the Unmai Vilakkam Press on Cutcherry Street in Erode and would reach its readers on Sundays. Talking about the need for bringing out a newspaper, Periyar wrote in the first issue:<\/p> <p>\u201cThere are many newspapers in the country but they are afraid to be true to their conscience. Unlike those newspapers I propose to give expression courageously in the Kudi Arasu to the truth as I see it.\u201d[1]<\/p> <p>Its first issue bore a crest with the figures of Bharat Mata, a woman at the spinning wheel, a peasant with a plough and a weaver at the loom. Symbolizing religious unity, it contained the pictures of a church and a temple.<\/p> <p>The editorial of the inaugural issue, written by Periyar, said, \u201cWe would certainly say to those who are interested to know about the ideals of our news medium that our mother country should develop its society, economy, politics and morality. Through this, we will tirelessly work for the mental and physical growth of the people and for the development of art and religion. It is not the intention of our newspaper just to call for nation and nationalism leaving aside all other noble ideals. But nation and nationalism should develop self-respect, socialism and fraternity among the people, who in turn should be bound by love and affection. The feelings of high and low add fuel to the fire of burning caste conflicts in society. Equality, devoid of all these social evils, should be maintained. Religious feuds and the evil of bringing gods to the courts of law should be discouraged. This weekly is devoted to the task of achieving these and other ideals for the benefit of the people.\u201d[2]<\/p> <p>This newspaper became the prime vehicle for the ideas of Periyar. The writings in its initial issues contained the seeds of Periyar\u2019s Self-Respect Movement. In the subsequent issues, Periyar made it clear that harping on only about nation and nationalism and fanning hostility between different sections on the pretext of nationalism, while ignoring the issues related to the progress of the common man, was not what the weekly intended to do. Periyar believed that a feeling of arrogance or of inferiority based on Varna or caste only served to strengthen casteism. This feeling should be done away with immediately. The people should be made to realize the truth that all humans are equal.<\/p> <p>The newspaper\u2019s crest carried poet Bharathi\u2019s verse as its motto and declared that its objective was to inculcate the sentiments of self-respect, equality and fraternity in the people. Social inequality and the feelings of high and low add fuel to the fire of caste conflicts, hence such inequality should be done away with immediately to promote a feeling of harmony and goodwill among the people.<\/p> <p>Periyar did not intend to use Kudi Arasu only as a means of informing the people about the activities of the Self-Respect Movement. His objective was to apprise the people of the caste system, religious hypocrisy and other evils of Hindu society as well as the concept of social justice through his courageous writings. Kudi Arasu had a rebellious tone from the very outset. It was as Periyar had intended. Kudi Arasu carried articles attacking casteist discrimination, religious ostentation and mythological tales. The language was simple but biting. \u201cWho is fit to receive donations? Brahmins\u201d; \u201cWhy do we criticize Brahmins?\u201d, \u201cThe truth of pilgrimage and the place of pilgrimages?\u201d, \u201cIs Kudi Arasu\u2019s criticism of the Brahmins logical?\u201d Articles with such headlines not only attacked Brahmanism without any demur but also pointed to the religious shackles that bound the Hindu community at the time.<\/p> <p>Kudi Arasu had announced that it would work for the self-reliance and the welfare of humans and would keep an eye on socio-religious pomp and show and distortions. It had also made it clear that it would not get entangled in political wrangling and would back constructive politics. Unlike the Congress and other political outfits of the time and the other newspapers published then, Kudi Arasu was not a nationalist publication. Indeed, Periyar wanted the country to become free. But for him, freedom from social absurdities like caste, casteist inequality, untouchability and religious ritualism was as important as freedom from British rule. Hence, its focus was on addressing social issues. It openly criticized all top leaders of the time who called themselves nationalists. Given its concerns and outlook, Kudi Arasu\u2019s rise marked a revolution in the history of journalism in Tamil Nadu.<\/p> <p>The entire Tamil-speaking area constituted the readership of Kudi Arasu. Initially, its print order was 2,000, which rose to 10,000 on occasions. But the circulation was not an accurate measure of its readership. There were many who could not afford to buy a copy. In the rural areas, the copies of the newspaper reached the homes of the leaders of the Self-Respect Movement, where it was read out to all the residents of the village. Thamizhavel G. Sarangapani played a key role in taking the newspaper to the Tamil diaspora especially in Malaya. When Periyar was in jail or abroad, his wife, Nagammai, his sister Kannammal and his brother E. V. Krishnasamy took up the responsibility of bringing out the newspaper. Besides Periyar, regular contributors to Kudi Arasu included committed fighters like Malayapuram Singaravelu Chettiar. Born into an ordinary family of fishermen, Singaravelu Chettiar was one of the founding fathers of the Communist Party of India. He is often described as the father of the Indian trade union movement. Before the founding of the Communist Party of India, he led a long struggle against caste and untouchability. In 1923, he started the tradition of celebrating 1 May as Labour Day in India. He was also the first to use the term \u201ccomrade\u201d for addressing the workers of the Communist Party. Periyar was very impressed with him and requested him to write for Kudi Arasu. Singaravelu played a key role in inculcating an understanding of science and in developing a scientific temper in Periyar. It was through Kudi Arasu that Periyar urged the people to start addressing him as \u201cthothar\u201d (comrade)[3]. And in the next issue of the magazine, he was addressed as \u201cthothar\u201d[4]. The word \u201cBrahmanphobia\u201d was frequently used in Kudi Arasu.<\/p> <p>The articles published in the newspaper were supportive of women\u2019s equality, were against casteism and untouchability and focused on atheism. Owing to its courageous and rebellious journalism, Kudi Arasu became a victim of the ire of the government on many occasions. Periyar was charged with treason. An article published by the newspaper in 1933 incensed the government so much that a fine of Rs 1,000 each was imposed on the editor and the printer and Periyar was jailed. The newspaper was banned many a time on the charge of promoting atheism and communism. In 1935, Periyar published the translation of The Communist Manifesto and Bhagat Singh\u2019s text titled Why I am an Atheist. That irked the obscurantist forces to no end. Under their pressure, Kudi Arasu was banned and Periyar and the Tamil translator P. Jeevandhan were arrested. Despite so many obstacles and problems, Kudi Arasu continued publication for around 25 years. It played a seminal role in the renaissance of the Tamil community. Its last issue came out on 5 November 1949.<\/p> <p>Dravidian<\/p> <p>Dravidian was a daily. It was launched in June 1917 by the South Indian Peoples\u2019 Association. Later, the organization was renamed the Justice Party. As is clear from the title, the newspaper\u2019s objective was to promote non-Brahmin politics in Tamil Nadu. At the time, all the newspapers and magazines were dominated by the Brahmins. The newspapers published by institutions were guided by their selfish sociopolitical interests. So, there was a dire need for a newspaper which could highlight the problems of the non-Brahmins. After a good start, the newspaper began floundering. In ten years, it saw five editors \u2013 P. Bhaktavatsalam Pillai (1917-1922), S. Somasundaram (1919), J.N. Ramanathan (1920-21) and A. Shadmugam Pillai (1923). In 1924, J. S. Kannapar was appointed as its editor.<\/p> <p>In February 1927, as the popular base of the Justice Party began shrinking, a need was felt for leaders who could help it regain its grip on the people. The party president Raja Panangal and A. Ramasamy Mudaliar requested Periyar to take charge of the newspaper. At the time, the Self-Respect Movement and the Justice Party were working jointly. Periyar had already launched Kudi Arasu but it was a weekly. Ultimately, for the sake of the Justice Party and the Self-Respect Movement, in 1928, Periyar took over the responsibility of editing Dravidian. His endearing language, his grip on issues of public interest and his combative tone benefitted Dravidian and the number of its subscribers began rising.<\/p> <p>Among the regular contributors to Dravidian were K.S. Chidambaranar, Neelawati, Gopal and others. The objective of the newspaper was to promote socio-cultural reforms and to inculcate political consciousness among the non-Brahmins. Some people could not digest the coming together of the Justice Party and the Self-Respect Movement. Periyar\u2019s image was that of a vocal non-Brahmin critic of superstitions and of the mythological narratives of the Hindu religion \u2013 one who considered the religious rituals as part of a brahmanical conspiracy. They strongly objected to Periyar\u2019s association with Dravidian. Such people started expressing their resentment. The Madras Mail commented on the development thus:<\/p> <p>\u201cSo far, the leadership of the Justice Party was condemning Brahmins, who are liberal and tolerant, but lack the capacity to resist. Now, it seems that some self-respecting Indians, Brahmin or non-Brahmin, have joined in and their ideological leanings are apparent.\u201d[5]<\/p> <p>The apprehensions voiced by The Madras Mail were not unfounded. Justice Party had leaders opposed to Periyar. They took a circuitous route to drive Periyar out of the newspaper. In January 1931, the government ordered Dravidian to furnish a security. Periyar said that he didn\u2019t have the money for the security. He suggested that the newspaper be shut down. It was shut down but only temporarily. Later that year, the newspaper resumed publication under the editorship of Justice Party leader A. Ammal. Dravidian suffered the fate of any publication when its leadership passes into the hands of someone lacking commitment. A. Ammal announced that the newspaper would adopt a \u201cneutral policy\u201d towards religion and social beliefs.<\/p> <p>Revolt<\/p> <p>Among the newspapers edited by Periyar, Revolt was the third most important after Kudi Arasu and Viduthalai. The latter two were brought out in Tamil while Revolt was published in English. Its first issue came out on 7 November 1928 from Erode. Revolt was printed at Unmai Vilakkam Press, Erode. Periyar\u2019s wife Nagammal was its publisher and printer. It was the organ of the Self-Respect Movement. In its inaugural issue, delineating the need for the publication of the newspaper, S. Ramanathan wrote:<\/p> <p>\u201cThey [Brahmin politicians] can pose a challenge for us in areas where Kudi Arasu doesn\u2019t have a reach. They can launch a campaign in foreign languages. Our needs have grown and so, for the expansion of our movement, we need an English newspaper to get our ideas to the English-speaking people.\u201d[6]<\/p> <p>Due to some unavoidable circumstances, Revolt had to be published from Madras for a while. Later, it was brought back to Erode. Periyar made the initial investment in Revolt. But as the newspaper\u2019s popularity began growing, it started generating enough revenue through sales and subscriptions to sustain itself. But still, the earnings were not high enough to be assured that it would be able to meet its expenses.<\/p> <p>In 1928, when Revolt began publication, the literacy rate of non-Brahmins in the Madras Presidency was just seven per cent. Among them, the number of those who could read and understand English was even less. Yet, Periyar took the courageous decision to launch a newspaper in English. Through Revolt, he wanted to convey his ideas to the class that considered itself educated and enlightened but was entrapped in the web of socio-cultural-religious evil practices and considered \u201cfaith\u201d above \u201creason\u201d. In a declaration before a judicial magistrate regarding the publication of Revolt, its publisher-printer Nagammal wrote:<\/p> <p>\u201cBy the word \u2018Revolt\u2019, I mean breaking with restrictions. That is, breaking with that constraint which goes against nature and reason \u2013 whether in politics, in bureaucracy, capitalism or in gender relations \u2013 whichever constraint violates human welfare (dharma) and human nature.\u201d[7]<\/p> <p>Periyar wanted to use Revolt to rebut the criticism of the Self-Respect Movement by the Brahmins. Notwithstanding financial problems and the socio-religious and political opposition, Revolt continued publication without a break till 1930. In this limited period, it published, without pulling punches, articles on the national and international issues related to social and religious reforms. It serialized long articles on the mythical narratives in the epics and the Puranas. It openly critiqued Brahmanism and its religious hypocrisy and casteist mindset. It was the first publication in the history of Indian journalism that pointedly questioned the mythical narratives of the epics and the Puranas and initiated a debate on them.<\/p> <p>Revolt was not only the organ of the Self-Respect Movement but was also the carrier of the ideas of Periyar. It regularly published content on elimination of the caste system, Hindi-Muslim unity, problems faced by labourers, Devadasi system, women\u2019s rights, untouchability, the superstitions spread in the garb of tradition and religion, the Congress\u2019 pro-tradition policies and the internal contradictions of Gandhi\u2019s programmes. During the short period of its existence, Revolt responded to national and international issues and concerns: the religious reforms undertaken by Amir Amanullah of Afghanistan; the Congress\u2019 problematic stance on untouchability; that party\u2019s two-facedness in its dealings with the British (invoking in this context, Hegel\u2019s dialectic); the controversy created by the publication of Katherine Mayo\u2019s Mother India and the temple entry struggles organized by the self-respecters. The newspaper not only expressed its views on these issues in a forthright manner but also triggered a lively debate on them in the contemporary newspapers. The initial issues of Revolt were edited by Periyar with the help of S. Ramanathan. Many contributors to the newspaper used aliases. Several much talked-about articles were published under aliases like Kirk (mad person), Fountain Pen, Ritus and BJ. The regular contributors included P. Chidambaram Pillay, George Joseph, K.M. Balasubramaniam, R. Vishwanathan, Guruswamy and others. On occasions, Dr Ambedkar also used to enrich the columns of the newspaper with his articles and reactions. Periyar\u2019s supporter Guruswamy employed satire. His articles played a big role in making Revolt popular.<\/p> <p>Besides articles, it also carried the speeches of the leading lights of the Self-Respect Movement like R.K. Shanmugam, Periyar and Ramasamy Mudaliar. It also took note of the activities of Jat-Pat Todak Mandal of Santram BA, Sri Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam of Narayan Guru and Dr Ambedkar\u2019s campaigns and movements and their achievements.<\/p> <p>A total of 55 issues of Revolt were published during the two years of its existence. It had to be shut down due to consistent losses. By then, many other newspapers that were not only free from the intellectual thralldom of Brahmanism but also had the courage to confront it, had come up. They included Thondan, Suyamariyathai Thondan and Kumaran, which were brought out from Tirunvelli, Erode and Karaikudi, respectively. They partially undid the damage caused to the Self-Respect Movement by the closure of Revolt. Be that as it may, what Revolt achieved in the brief period of its existence was an excellent example of journalism that was rational and had pro-people concerns. The following excerpts from an editorial titled \u201cReligion is in Danger\u201d published by Revolt in its issue dated 22 November 1929 is an example of its journalism of courage:<\/p> <p>\u201cThe condition in India is however quite different. Here is a religion, whose name is not found in any of the so-called religious books of the \u2018Hindus\u2019 and whose sole credit lies in its undeterminable origin and time. But many of its followers say that the Vedas are the authority for their religion. The Vedas are again hypocritically said to be written in a language delivered by the Almighty himself. It is supposed to be written in an unspoken dead language, which should be heard and read only by a divinely descended population of 3 per cent of the \u2018Hindus\u2019. The remaining 97 per cent of the population are given the appellation of \u2018Sudras\u2019, which means \u2018either slaves or sons of Brahmins\u2019 concubines\u2019. If these \u2018Sudras\u2019 dare to read the Vedas, their tongues are to be cut off; if they hear the Vedas, their ears are to be filled with molten lead; if they keep any portion of the Vedas in their hearts, their hearts are to be thrown in the fire.\u201d[8]<\/p> <p>Only a \u201cPeriyar\u201d could have done such courageous, true journalism. As they launched a no-holds-barred attack on Hindu mythology, Kudi Arasu and Revolt only had a limited readership. But that did not worry Periyar. He believed in direct communication with the people through public meetings. If necessary, he addressed several meetings during the course of a day. Commenting on this, T.P. Vedachalam, general secretary of Dravida Kazgham (Dravidian Federation), said, \u201cThere were no publicists like Periyar in the past and there is little possibility of publicists like him emerging in the future.\u201d The key theme of his speeches was \u201cBrahmanism is the root of all evils\u201d and this theme was conveyed to the readers in a logical fashion through Revolt.<\/p> <p>Puratchi<\/p> <p>\u201cPuratchi\u201d means revolution. Puratchi was launched in 1933 and Periyar\u2019s sister Kannambal was its editor. Periyar had just returned from abroad, spending most of his time in the Soviet Union. He was very impressed with the Soviet Union \u2013 so much so that had made structural changes to the organization of the Self-Respect Movement to bring it in tune with the communist ideology. In between, the publication of Kudi Arasu had to be suspended for some time due the government\u2019s fiats.<\/p> <p>In keeping with its title, Periyar used Puratchi to spread his revolutionary ideas. The government was keeping an eye on him. At the time, the government was extremely wary of communism. The brahmanical forces also saw communism as a threat. On 2 June 1934, Periyar\u2019s brother E.V. Krishnasamy was arrested and charged with conspiring against the government. The office of Puratchi was searched. Later, Krishnasamy was released on bail but before resuming publication, the publisher and printer of Puratchi were ordered to furnish a security of Rs 2,000. Periyar decided to close down the publication rather than depositing the security.<\/p> <p>\u2018Pagutharivu\u2019<\/p> <p>After the closure of Puratchi, Periyar began the publication of Pagutharivu in 1934. The word \u201cpagutharivu\u201d means rational. Scholars differ on the exact date of the launch of the publication. According to K. Veeramani, the newspaper was launched on 12 January 1934[9]. Other scholars say it began publication on 26 August 1934[10]. Pagutharivu was Kudi Arasu taking on a new form. The alphabets Periyar introduced as part of his reform of the Tamil script in 1932 first appeared in Pagutharivu.<\/p> <p>Periyar wrote several scholarly articles on socialism, communism and rationalism in Pagutharivu. By 1934, Periyar had declared himself a staunch atheist. Now, he began critiquing religions other than Hinduism. In 1934, he wrote in Pagutharivu that no religion, including Islam and Christianity, is free from religious evils. The newspaper published a Tamil translation of The Priest, the Woman and the Confessional, in which a Christian priest is shown spreading obscurantist ideas. It says that Christianity, too, promotes unscientific and illogical ideas. In one of his editorials, talking about Hinduism, he writes:<\/p> <p>\u201cThe religious festivals of Hindus are celebrated at public places. Pandals are erected right in the middle of the roads. The roads are completely taken over \u2013 just as it happens when the deity of Vijayanagar is taken for immersion into the sea. This can lead to communal violence. If there is a mosque on the route of the procession and if most of the people living around happen to be Muslims, the possibility of a riot breaking out is even higher. During Navratri, rival groups extort \u2018donations\u2019 from the people. This shows how our festivals have become a big danger for public security and peace \u2026\u201d[11]<\/p> <p>The newspaper published many stories on the economy. Some of them demanded an immediate waiver of all public and private loans. Like Puratchi, this newspaper, too, could last only for a year.<\/p> <p>Viduthalai<\/p> <p>Viduthalai has pride of place among the newspapers founded by Periyar. The word \u201cviduthalai\u201d means freedom. The daily, launched in 1935, was published in Tamil. By 1935, the Self-Respect Movement had won considerable popular support. The movement had branches in all districts and towns. Vidhuthalai was launched by Periyar to act as a vehicle for taking his ideas to the general public and the workers of the Self-Respect Movement. E.V. Krishnasamy was the publisher and Mutthusami Pillai, the editor. The newspaper sought to make the people aware of the brahmanical mumbo-jumbo, hypocrisy and rituals and promote scientific temper. The newspaper was merciless in pounding the narratives that formed part of the Vedas and the Puranas. This naturally infuriated a section of the people. The newspaper\u2019s editor Mutthusamy had to spend six months in jail on the charge of fomenting division and enmity between the Aryans and the Dravidians[12].<\/p> <p>A maxim or two was published on the second page in each issue of Vidhuthalai. Normally, daily newspapers publish short articles focusing on the contemporary burning issues, which keep changing by the day. But Viduthalai was different. It published long articles centred on topics that had nothing to do with the affairs of the day. The articles were so long that they were published in instalments. One such topic was \u201cRationalism in world history\u201d. Viduthalai regularly published news related to scientific inventions and science emerging from around the world. As rationalism was its guiding light, Viduthalai\u2019s tone and tenor was anti-government and it tore into brahmanical excesses and the Hindu scriptures. That, on occasions, earned it the ire of the brahmanical forces.<\/p> <p>Viduthalai is still in existence. It is edited by K. Veeramani, who had joined the newspaper in 1956. He took over as editor in 1978.<\/p> <p>Unmai<\/p> <p>\u201cUnmai\u201d is Tamil for something that exists or is real. Unmai was the name of a Tamil fortnightly published by Periyar. The newspaper\u2019s first issue came out on 14 January 1970. The newspaper was devoted to the changes coming about in Indian society. The cover page of the inaugural issue carried a picture of Buddha. The second page carried the teachings of Buddha in his own words. Like other newspaper edited by Periyar, Unmai, too, was devoted to the annihilation of Brahmanism, caste and social and gender discrimination. Unmai is still being published in a digital form. K. Veeramani is its editor.<\/p> <p>The Modern Rationalist<\/p> <p>The Modern Rationalist was an English-language monthly. Its first issue in 1971 carried the picture of Periyar on the cover page. Later, many national leaders, including Indira Gandhi, Kamaraj and Annadurai, appeared on its cover. As is clear from its title, The Modern Rationalist aimed at inculcating respect for and faith in logic and reason in its readers. The journal published the ideas and beliefs of leading rationalists from all over the world, including Galileo, Thomas Jefferson, Voltaire, Copernicus, Darwin, Bruno, Anaxagoras, Confucius, Huxley, Thomas Paine, Hegel, Rousseau and others, from time from time. There was a regular column devoted to the writings and the speeches of Periyar. Another column was reserved for scientific inventions. The newspaper also critiqued Hindu religious philosophy.<\/p> <p>This was the only periodical devoted to Periyar\u2019s thinking. It exposed the truth behind superstitions and rituals. It is still being published.<\/p> <p>The Rational Books Publication Society<\/p> <p>Rationalism as a way of thinking emerged in the West in the 15-16th centuries. At the time, India was in the throes of a parallel revolution and counter-revolution. While saint-poets like Kabir and Raidas were fighting socio-cultural evil practices and fashioning utopias like Amarpuri and Begumpura, other poets like Tulsidas and Surdas were, deliberately or otherwise, strengthening the Varnashrama dharma in the name of Bhakti. By the 20th century, intellectual renaissance had reached its zenith in the West, where the people were endeavouring to build their societies in consonance with modern life-values. In India, top intellectuals helming different institutions, under the garb of cultural renaissance, were trying their best to stop the intellectual consciousness of Western origin from striking roots in the country. They enjoyed whole-hearted backing of the dominant political and economic forces. Such was the situation Periyar was caught up in. He was a staunch rationalist and wanted the people to make reason the mainstay of their thought process and to break free from the evils being propagated in the name of religion. For that to happen, it was essential to introduce the people to the modern streams of thought.<\/p> <p>The scriptures could be countered only by books armed with modern life-values. That was why besides editing\/publishing newspapers like Kudi Arasu, Puratchi and Viduthalai, Periyar, who was very impressed with the Rationalist Press Association of London, also established The Rational Books Publication Society. The Society came into being on 13 December 1932 and was registered as a limited company. The Society was basically an offshoot of the Self-Respect Movement. Periyar wanted to build a corpus of Rs 30,000 by selling the shares of the company at the rate of Rs 10 per share. The corpus was to be used for publishing Indian and foreign literature on intellectual discourse. Many well-known intellectuals and authors were associated with the Self-Respect Movement. Periyar wanted their thoughts and ideas to reach the entire Dravidian population through the four south Indian languages. Initially, the Society published books only in Tamil. In the first phase, 20 books by leading rationalists from all over the world were made available to the people at affordable prices[13].<\/p> <p>Among the books published by the Society were Materialism and Kudi Arasu Kulambagam (collection) by Periyar. The two books, running into 72 and 120 pages respectively, were a compilation of the speeches delivered at the meetings of the Self-Respect Movement and select editorials and articles published in Kudi Arasu, Puratchi, Viduthalai and others. Periyar had become very vocal on issues like religion, god and clergy. The rest of the books were also acerbic attacks on religion and theism. They brutally dismembered religion, god and ritualism. The books published by the Society included M. Singaravelu\u2019s Scientific Techniques and Superstitions, Robert G. Ingersoll\u2019s The Gods and Why I am an Agnostic, Bertrand Russell\u2019s Has Religion Made Useful Contributions to Civilization?, Joseph Martin McCabe\u2019s Is There Life After Death? and George Townshend Fox\u2019s Priestly Celibacy Exposed[14]. What was common to all these books written by different authors at different times was that they questioned the relevance of religion and god. Their central message was that god, religion, soul, virtuous and sinful deeds, heaven and hell are only human imaginations; these have been created by the priests to serve their own vested interests; the priests fool the humans into ignoring this world for the imaginary other world; man is a rational being and rationality should determine his beliefs, hence, reason and logic should be deployed to negate the dead faiths thrust on the people by the priestly class; scientific thinking, logic and reason should be used to dismantle superstitions like god, religion, heaven and hell, virtuous and sinful deeds and worship as they insult the reasoning faculty of the human being.<\/p> <p>Among the books published by the Rational Books Publication Society, many were translations from English and attacked Christianity and the Church. This angered the Catholic Church, which lodged a complaint against Periyar and the Self-Respect Movement. As a result, Kudi Arasu\u2019s editor and publisher were arrested by the Government of Madras Presidency. The case went to court and both of them were ordered to deposit sureties of Rs 1,000 each for disrupting social harmony. But the Catholic Church was not satisfied. It appealed to its followers not to fall into the trap of the blasphemers and continue to be loyal to the church. Commenting on these books which advocated materialism and questioned the rationale and usefulness of the concepts of religion and god, the Catholic Church said, \u201cThese books are just Tamil versions of books written a long time ago in the West and display the sophism and mindlessness of their writers.\u201d About the leaders of the movement, the Catholic Church said that they called themselves self-respecters though they were slaves to their own futile arguments and false beliefs.<\/p> <p>Periyar was now under pressure from the government and the attack from the Catholic Church. Brahmins were already flaying him for being a traitor to religion and culture. The government, the Catholic Church and the Brahmins \u2013 all wanted to discourage Periyar and his associates. Yet, the popularity of the Self-Respect Movement was growing by leaps and bounds. Periyar and his associates were very efficiently taking their communist agenda forward. The emphasis on materialism was a part of that agenda.<\/p> <p>The activities of the movement spread rapidly in the period 1934-35. This made Periyar even more popular among the masses. Sensing a good opportunity, Periyar resumed the publication of Kudi Arasu from 13 January 1936. This was a big achievement for the movement. The circulation of Kudi Arasu grew from 2,000 to 10,000. The Self-Respect Movement had established Readers\u2019 Centres in remote villages. The copies of the newspaper reaching the villages were read out at these centres in the presence of dozens of people and sometimes the entire village. Thus, the contents of each copy were read and heard by hundreds and acted as a powerful medium for dissemination of the ideology of the movement. Around the same time, a new journal, Tamilian, supportive of the cause of the movement, began publication. This also showed the growing clout of the movement.<\/p> <p>The opponents of the movement, however, were also active. On their complaint, the police raided the offices of Kudi Arasu and of the Rational Books Publication Society on 20 January 1935. Both the offices were thoroughly searched. The residence of its chief editor, E.V. Krishnasamy, was also raided. The next day, on 21 January, the office of Samdharma at Jolarpet was raided, following which Krishnaswamy and Jeevanandam were arrested[15]. Jeevanandam was the honorary editor of Samdharma. Both were charged with hatching a conspiracy against the government. Samdharma\u2019s editor was asked to deposit a security of Rs 3,000 for continuing the publication. Depositing the security would have meant subjecting the journal to constant scrutiny by the government. The detractors of the movement were no less active and there was always the possibility of penal action in the future. In December 1934, after much deliberation it was decided to cease the publication of Samdharma. At the time, the movement was planning to launch two monthlies \u2013 Pagutharivu and Capital from Erode and Nagapattinam, respectively. The government was dead set against the movement. It began contemplating imposing bonds before permitting the publication of the two journals. One reason for the government\u2019s fury was the publication of Bhagat Singh\u2019s Why I am an Atheist by the movement both in Kudi Arasu and separately as a booklet. Translated by Jeevanandan into Tamil, the booklet, like Kudi Arasu, was printed at the Unmai Vilakkam Press, Erode. All the copies were seized immediately after printing. The opponents of the movement were convinced that pressure from all sides would lead to the collapse of the movement. But nothing of the sort happened. Its leaders didn\u2019t lose heart. Their faith in communism and materialism remained intact. Articles praising the twin ideologies continued to be published in Kudi Arasu and Pagutharivu. The Soviet Union continued to be their ideal. Government\u2019s anger, attacks by the Catholic Church, speculations by newspapers and the police raids on their offices had triggered all kinds of rumours about the movement. To clear the air, on 6 March 1935, Periyar issued a written statement to try and remove the misconceptions regarding the objectives and the working of the movement. He wrote:<\/p> <p>\u201cI have noticed that for some time, misapprehensions have been spread about the objectives and the programmes of the Self-Respect Movement. The baseless and motivated propaganda by the enemies of the movement is majorly behind it. Hence, I consider it necessary to offer an explanation to address the wrong notions about the movement in the minds of the people and to protect them from the false propaganda by mischievous elements.\u201d<\/p> <p>He wrote further:<\/p> <p>\u201cIt has been made amply clear in the past, too, that the basic objective of the Self-Respect Movement is to free the oppressed and exploited castes of south India from their miseries and take them on the path to betterment. In addition, improving the lot of women is also the objective of the movement. To achieve these objectives, it is essential for the movement to have a concrete social, economic and political ideology and work in keeping with it. As the key initiator of this movement, I am committed to confining its activities to the three above-mentioned fields (social, economic and political).\u201d[16]<\/p> <p>The statement gave the impression that Periyar was capitulating before the government. But the fact was that due to his communist leanings and the policies of the movement vis-\u00e0-vis religion, the government was extremely incensed. This explanation was needed to protect the movement from the fatal blows of the government. The statement evoked different reactions. The issue of Kudi Arasu that carried this statement also carried an advertisement of a recently published book by Jean Meslier. This was the twentieth book published by the Society, which was focused on materialism and which dealt severe blows to the concepts of god, soul and religion and to the Catholic Church.<\/p> <p>References<\/p> <p>[1] Kudi Arasu, 2 May 1925<\/p> <p>[2] Kudi Arasu, 2 May 1925, quoted in Revathi Thomas, \u2018E.V.R.

The cyclical nature of abuses against LGBT people, emanating from the family and stretching into every aspect of their public life, renders any \u201csuspicion\u201d of homosexuality or gender variance a cause for potential violence, which not only results in the death of LGBT people but makes their lives unlivable.<\/p> <p>This report is focused on killings, abductions, torture, and sexual violence against LGBT people by armed groups in Iraq. It is based on 54 interviews with LGBT Iraqis who have survived violence and discrimination by state and non-state actors, based primarily on their gender expression and presumed sexual orientation.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch, supported by the Iraqi LGBT rights organization IraQueer, documented eight cases of abductions, eight cases of attempted murder, four extrajudicial killings, twenty-seven cases of sexual violence\u2014including gang rape\u2014forty-five cases of threats to rape and kill, and forty-two cases of online targeting by individuals who identified themselves as members of armed groups against LGBT people in Iraq. In eight cases, abuses by armed groups and state actors, including arbitrary arrest and sexual violence, were against children as young as 15. In thirty-nine cases, individuals were able to identify the armed group behind the attack against them.<\/p> <p>Mariam, a 21-year-old lesbian woman from Baghdad, is one of many LGBT Iraqis who said they were harassed at checkpoints by security forces due to their appearance.  2022 John Holmes for Human Rights Watch Zoran, a 25-year-old gay man from Sulaymaniyah, said he was sexually assaulted by two members of the Asayish while he was on a date with a man who tricked him after they met on a same-sex dating application.  2022 John Holmes for Human Rights Watch Laith, a 27-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said he watched as armed group members abducted his boyfriend from his house, tortured and killed him.  2022 John Holmes for Human Rights Watch Karim, an 18-year-old gay man from Najaf, said he was 17 when police in Baghdad arrested him, verbally and physically abused him, sexually harassed him, and subjected him to a forced anal exam.  2022 John Holmes for Human Rights Watch<\/p> <p>The public nature of the abuses documented, mostly occurring in broad daylight in the streets, coupled with their chilling intentionality, signal the climate of impunity afforded to perpetrators. The arbitrary nature of the attacks demonstrates that individuals are targeted as part of a larger scheme to intimidate those who do not adhere to normativity and to punish aberration. The Iraqi state\u2019s failure to tackle the discriminatory social norms that underpin violence against LGBT people, as well as its reinforcement of these standards by way of promoting an anti-LGBT discourse through \u2018morality\u2019-based policies, contribute to fueling violence against individuals perceived as non-normative.<\/p> <p>The abuses documented in this report, including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture, and killings, are not unique to LGBT people. Other ordinary Iraqis also face these forms of violence. But in the case of LGBT people, the violence emanates from and is exacerbated by their gender expression or perceived sexual orientation.<\/p> <p>LGBT people across Iraq face routine violence from security officials, who verbally abuse and sexually assault them, arbitrarily arrest them, and detain them. Security forces also physically, verbally, and sexually harass people at checkpoints whom they perceive to be LGBT.<\/p> <p>LGBT people can be arrested under a range of vague provisions of the penal code aimed at policing morals and public indecency and limiting free expression. Human Rights Watch documented 15 cases of arrest by security forces of 13 LGBT people in Iraq. In June 2021, police in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) issued arrest warrants based on article 401 of the penal code which criminalizes \u201cpublic indecency\u201d against 11 LGBT rights activists who are either current or former employees at Rasan Organization, a Sulaymaniyah-based human rights group. As of March 2022, the case remained open pending investigation, though authorities had not detained the activists.<\/p> <p>Most of the arrests of LGBT people documented in this report had no legal basis, even under Iraqi law Individuals stopped at checkpoints and subsequently arrested were rarely charged or convicted in accordance with the law. LGBT people arrested reported being forced to sign pledges stating that they had not been subjected to abuse and being denied access to a lawyer. The conditions of their detention included being denied food and water, the right to access family and legal representation or obtain medical services, as well as being sexually assaulted and physically abused. One 18-year-old gay man said he was subjected to a forced anal exam when he was 17 years old. Another 18-year-old gay man said officers attempted the same when he was 17.<\/p> <p>Twenty-seven of the fifty-four LGBT people Human Rights Watch and IraQueer interviewed said they had experienced sexual abuse and violence by armed groups, including unwanted touching, rape, gang rape, genital mutilation, and forced anal examinations.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch also documented cases of digital targeting and online harassment on social media and same-sex dating applications by armed groups against LGBT people. As evident from the accounts of those interviewed by Human Rights Watch and IraQueer, the offline consequences of digital targeting are long-lasting. Individuals targeted reported being forced to change their residence, delete all social media accounts, change their phone numbers, and in some cases flee the country for fear of being monitored, blackmailed, and entrapped by armed groups.<\/p> <p>The accounts documented detail a cycle of abuse, including a pattern of attempting to hunt LGBT people down to perpetrate harm against them, amounting to structural violence against them. The combination of hypervulnerability, loosely defined \u201cmorality\u201d clauses, and the absence of domestic violence and anti-discrimination legislation and reliable complaint systems, are formidable barriers that impede LGBT people\u2019s ability and willingness to report abuses they suffer to the police, or file complaints against law enforcement agents, creating an environment in which police and armed groups can abuse them with impunity.<\/p> <p>Forty out of the fifty-four LGBT people whom Human Rights Watch and IraQueer interviewed reported experiencing extreme violence at least once by family members, almost always by male relatives, for their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression. Such violence included being locked in a room for extended periods; being denied food and water; being burnt, beaten, raped, electrocuted, attacked at gunpoint, subjected to conversion practices, and forced hormone therapy; being subjected to forced marriages; and being forced to work for long hours without compensation. Unlike the KRI, Iraq has no domestic violence legislation, instead its penal code allows for violence against women and children.<\/p> <p>Each of the LGBT people whom Human Rights Watch and IraQueer interviewed reported experiencing harassment in the streets, ranging from verbal abuse to being attacked at gun point. Lack of access to protective mechanisms limits LGBT people\u2019s mobility to a debilitating extent and deters them from seeking redress for abuses committed against them. Children facing violence from family members or others may be completely isolated, with nowhere to turn for safety.<\/p> <p>As a result, many LGBT people said they felt they were forced to hide who they are to stay alive. Those who could not or did not wish to conceal their identities described a form of self-imposed house arrest, by which they refrained from leaving their homes at all, due to fear of harassment and the possibility of being stopped at checkpoints or targeted by armed groups. Sixteen LGBT people interviewed by Human Rights Watch and IraQueer said they attempted suicide at least once.<\/p> <p>All 54 LGBT people interviewed for this report said that they would not report a crime committed against them to the authorities, either because of previous failed attempts where the complaint was dismissed or no action was taken, or because they felt that the blame will be redirected at them due to their non-conforming sexual orientations, gender identities, and expressions.<\/p> <p>The Iraqi government is responsible for protecting Iraqis\u2019 right to life. Iraqi authorities should investigate all reports of armed group or other violence against people targeted due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity and expression, prosecute, fairly try, and appropriately punish those found responsible, and publicly and expressly condemn all such violence. The government should take all appropriate measures to end torture, disappearances, summary killings, and other abuses based on sexual orientation and gender expression and identity, and compensate the families of all victims of unlawful killings and survivors of serious abuse.<\/p> <p>Iraqi security forces should stop harassing and arresting LGBT people on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender expression and instead ensure their protection from violence. Iraq should introduce and implement legislation protecting against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch and IraQueer also call on states providing military, security, and intelligence assistance to Iraq, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, to urge Iraqi authorities to investigate allegations of abuses by armed groups and the role of their own assistance in these alleged violations. These states should suspend military, security, and intelligence assistance to units involved in these violations and explain any suspension or end to military assistance publicly. These states should continue to suspend assistance until the government adopts measures to end these serious human rights violations.<\/p> <p>Glossary<\/p> <p>Biological Sex: Biological classification of bodies as female, male, or other, based on factors such as external sex organs, internal sexual and reproductive organs, hormones, and chromosomes.<\/p> <p>Bisexual: Sexual orientation of a person who is sexually and romantically attracted to both men and women.<\/p> <p>Cisgender: Denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender corresponds with their birth sex.<\/p> <p>Gay: Synonym in many parts of the world for homosexual; used here to refer to the sexual orientation of a man whose primary sexual and romantic attraction is toward other men.<\/p> <p>Gender: Social and cultural codes (as opposed to biological sex) used to distinguish between what a society considers \u201cmasculine,\u201d \u201cfeminine,\u201d or \u201cother\u201d conduct.<\/p> <p>Gender Affirming Surgery: Surgical procedures that change one\u2019s body to conform to one\u2019s gender identity.

The research included 54 individual interviews with people who identify as LGBT. At the time of the research, 50 of those interviewed resided in various regions of Iraq, one lived in France, one in Canada, and two in Turkey. The research also involved two virtual focus group discussions with Iraqi LGBT people and activists working on issues of gender and sexuality in Iraq.<\/p> <p>The interviewees comprised twenty-seven gay men, thirteen transgender women, eight lesbian women, three bisexual individuals, two transgender girls, and one transgender man.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch and IraQueer also interviewed six witnesses to killings and abductions by armed groups of LGBT people. Eleven of the fifty-four LGBT people interviewed had intimate, first-hand knowledge of killings by armed groups. Several individuals were interviewed twice for corroboration and accuracy purposes.<\/p> <p>Of the fifty-four interviewees, twenty-nine reported abuses they faced in Baghdad, ten in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, namely in Sulaymaniyah and Erbil, six in Najaf, five in Basra, two in Mosul, one in Karbala, and one in Kirkuk. The abuses documented occurred between 2018 and 2021.<\/p> <p>Eight of the abuses documented, including arrests and sexual harassment, were against LGBT children as young as 15 at the time.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch also reviewed online footage of attacks against LGBT people, including videos, images, and digital threats.<\/p> <p>This report was researched in collaboration with the Iraqi LGBT rights organization IraQueer, based in Baghdad. IraQueer assisted Human Rights Watch by reaching out to seven of those interviewed. All interviews were conducted remotely, on digital platforms and over the phone. Four interviews were conducted in writing for the individuals\u2019 security. Human Rights Watch and IraQueer vetted all those interviewed for authenticity.<\/p> <p>All interviewees gave their informed consent and were informed they could stop the interview at any time or decline to answer any questions they did not feel comfortable answering.<\/p> <p>Interviewees did not receive any compensation for the interviews. Interviews were conducted in Arabic and translated into English. All interviews were conducted privately.<\/p> <p>The names of all LGBT interviewees have been withheld to assure their anonymity. Each has been assigned a pseudonym in this report that bears no relation to their real name. In instances of publicized killings, the real names of the victims are included.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch also interviewed representatives of nine local, regional, and international human rights organizations and international agencies, as well as seven representatives of foreign missions in Iraq, including embassies, and advocates in Iraq who work on LGBT issues.<\/p> <p>I. Background<\/p> <p>In Iraq, a hairstyle, fashion sense, or polished nails could be tantamount to a death sentence. Since 2005, Iraqi armed forces have launched attacks against individuals marked as LGBT based primarily on their appearance and \u201csuspicion\u201d of same-sex conduct. While kidnappings, torture, and killings of LGBT people and those perceived as LGBT by Iraqi armed forces has been repeated, government officials have absolved themselves of responsibility and instead have claimed that these abusive armed forces were attempting to stand as protectors for morals and religious traditions.<\/p> <p>Violence directed against LGBT people in Iraq can be understood in the context of patriarchal social norms, the low social status of women, and a culture of impunity. This coupled with the economic precarity of perpetrators creates a climate in which violence, sometimes fatal, occurs. When recruiting members, armed groups feed on poverty, offering unemployed men a job and the prospect of gaining power and influence through violence. These armed groups are not unitary entities, but are comprised of networks operating in disorganized patterns for an organized intent, maintaining the \u201csocial order\u201d and policing notions of \u201cmorality.\u201d<\/p> <p>The structural violence that LGBT people endure in Iraq is exacerbated by intersecting forms of precarity: class, sect, pressure to conform to social norms, and the lack of state protections. The targeting is often accompanied by egregious sexual violence, an attempt to discipline, \u201cfeminize,\u201d and punish gender non-conforming bodies. The verbal abuse that accompanies this violence, such as calling gay men \u201cfarakh\u201d [Arabic term for chick], expresses contempt for victims for offending masculinity, demoting them to the \u201cfeminine.\u201d The institutionalization of some armed groups asserts their legitimacy as \u201cprotectors of the nation\u201d and \u201cenforcers of the status quo.\u201d<\/p> <p>Not all Iraqi LGBT people face abuse, and not all those who face abuse due to perceived sexual orientation or gender identity are LGBT. People who are seen to transgress gender or sexual norms are at particular risk. In parts of Iraq this means that many people practice a form of self-censorship or go into self-imposed hiding.<\/p> <p>All but one of the fifty-four LGBT people interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they practice extreme self-censorship to survive interactions with security forces and potential targeting by armed groups. This censorship extends to every sphere of their lives, including how they dress, talk, walk, and use digital platforms and social media. Those who cannot hide their identities rarely leave their homes, as stated by 44 of those interviewed by Human Rights Watch.<\/p> <p>Many of the LGBT people who faced abuses documented in this report are from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In some instances, lack of socioeconomic power dictates individuals\u2019 mobility, sphere of influence, and degree of social visibility. Political affiliation for poor families, including with armed groups, is often a means of survival because it can mean access to basic services. Sectarian incentives, motivated largely by demographic and economic necessity, contribute to policing non-normativity for LGBT people to preserve the status quo and repress any disruptions. LGBT people, lacking political backing in government or public discourse, are left to navigate these systems with relentless vulnerability.<\/p> <p>As demonstrated in many cases documented in this report, Iraqi police and security forces are often complicit in compounding anti-LGBT violence by targeting LGBT people at Iraq\u2019s ubiquitous checkpoints, arbitrarily arresting individuals due to non-conforming appearance, and using their sociopolitical vulnerability to perpetrate sexual violence against them.<\/p> <p>Iraqi authorities have done little to investigate or halt violence against LGBT people, despite being clearly aware of the crimes. Over the years, authorities have not held perpetrators accountable, including security forces, for kidnappings, torture, and killings of people perceived as gay and transgender. A 2012 government committee established to address abuses against LGBT people took few tangible steps to protect them before disbanding.<\/p> <p>As evident in the accounts documented in this report, a significant development in recent years is that families have become aware of the state-sponsored anti-LGBT discourse and are perpetuating violence against their children based on their gender expression. Most of the attacks start at home, with the intention, sanctioned by law, of punishing children suspected of being gay or gender non-conforming. In 21 cases documented in this report, individuals were strictly prohibited from leaving their homes by their parents.<\/p> <p>Social Context<\/p> <p>The Politics of Hair<\/p> <p>I often hide the way I look and tie my hair not to face any problems. In June 2021, I was stopped at a checkpoint by Hashd al-Atabat, an armed group in Karbala Governorate [central Iraq]. They said they did not like the way I looked\u2026. After the armed group\u2019s leader came, he told his men to cut my hair and let me go.<\/p> <p>\u2014Ali, 18-year-old gay man from Karbala, July 5, 2021<\/p> <p>Preserving a clearly defined gender binary, in its normative ideals of femininity and masculinity, is a distinct preoccupation for the authorities in Iraq, enacted and represented by people policing hairstyles. Hairstyle is a medium for communication, but also can become a target of profiling and a justification for brutality.<\/p> <p>According to 48 LGBT people interviewed by Human Rights Watch, having long hair for men, and alternatively short hair for women, constitutes a punishable offense. The consequences of having non-normative hairstyles can range from arrest to torture, and even death.<\/p> <p>Karar Nushi, an Iraqi model who was known for his long blond hair and flamboyant clothing, was found dead in Baghdad on July 2, 2017. Nushi was reportedly tortured and stabbed, his body mutilated, and his hair cut. Friends of Nushi believe he was murdered by an armed group because of his long hair.<\/p> <p>Sami, a 23-year-old gay man from Najaf (a city south of Baghdad), said he is prevented from entering some caf\u00e9s there, due to the way his hair is styled, which does not conform to the \u201cpolitics of the city in which he lives.\u201d He said:<\/p> <p>I have long hair, but I tie it when I go out, so I don\u2019t look queer. I get bullied a lot for my hair, and I used to receive a lot of backlash. They would call me \u2018Sousou\u2019 [a derogatory feminized name modification] and \u2018faggot.\u2019 Even my parents use such language to describe LGBT people.<\/p> <p>Majd, a 22-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said:<\/p> <p>My father overheard me talking on the phone with another man. I had long hair and my father cut it out of rage. He also threatened to kill me at gunpoint.<\/p> <p>When asked if he gets stopped at checkpoints, Montaser, a 26-year-old bisexual man from Kirkuk [city north of Baghdad], said:<\/p> <p>This happens almost daily; I\u2019ve been stopped [at checkpoints] countless times. It is mostly because of my long hair and the fact that I wear an earring. I was stopped while driving with a friend in Kirkuk for my long hair and they [police officers] wanted to cut it. They asked me questions about my hair and insulted me, calling me a she-male. \u2018Aren\u2019t you ashamed?,\u2019 they asked. They pulled me out of the car and took me to the Arafa police station next to the checkpoint, and I stayed there for an hour. They wanted me to sign a paper and promise that I will cut my hair. I told them they had no business cutting my hair. I have also been told by the principal of my university that my long hair is a bad reputation for the institution.<\/p> <p>Queer Strategies as Resistance<\/p> <p>When they [police officers] ask me why my hair is so short, I tell them I have cancer, and they leave me alone.<\/p> <p>\u2014Mariam, 21-year-old Iraqi lesbian, July 23, 2021<\/p> <p>In confronting the structural violence LGBT people in Iraq face daily, they employ queer strategies as articulations of agency. They do this with humor, an intimate understanding of their realities, and by tactically navigating public spaces. The stories they told Human Rights Watch are horrific, but within them are instances of triumph against oppressive structures.<\/p> <p>Khadija, a 31-year-old transgender woman who survived a killing attempt, said, \u201cPolice officers constantly try to coerce me into giving them my phone number. I give them a fake one. They always try calling it in front of me, and I smile and say, \u2018Yes, I have it.\u2019\u201d<\/p> <p>Sami, a 23-year-old gay man from Najaf, said he does not use a sim card on his phone, only wireless internet connection, to avoid being targeted by armed groups. Sami spoke about the strategies he employs to bypass digital surveillance. He said:<\/p> <p>I don\u2019t comment on any posts. Because if I do, they [armed groups] will access my profile and campaign against me. Some people would even access my profile and take stills from my posts and post them on different groups to say, \u2018Look at this queer from Najaf,\u2019 to expose my sexuality without my consent. I had to remove all photos that showed my face.<\/p> <p>Abbad, a 26-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said:<\/p> <p>I realized I had two choices\u2014either act straight or get killed. It took years for me to learn how to protect myself, including online. I use dating applications, but only premium accounts, so I can control how my account looks. I never allow screenshots or enable location. I never send pictures or videos.<\/p> <p>Masa, a 19-year-old transgender woman from Najaf, explained how she navigates potential violence in public. She said:<\/p> <p>I start shouting when men approach me. It is a tactic; I keep stalling until I get them to an area filled with people then I let out a few loud cries so they would be embarrassed and leave. They want to shame me, so I shame them instead, under the same logic.<\/p> <p>Salim, a 20-year-old gay man from Baghdad, described an arrangement he made with his fianc\u00e9e to escape forced marriage. He said:<\/p> <p>I got engaged to a girl because I am forced to, because our society does not accept same-sex marriage. My fianc\u00e9e is a lesbian, and she has a girlfriend. We have a great arrangement, and our parents have no idea. It is the only way to survive.<\/p> <p>Legal Context<\/p> <p>LGBT people can be and are arrested under a range of vague provisions of the penal code aimed at policing morals and public indecency and limiting free expression. In researching this report, Human Rights Watch documented 15 cases in which 13 of the LGBT interviewees had been arrested. Most of the abuses against LGBT people documented in this report have no legal basis in domestic law. Individuals stopped at checkpoints and subsequently arrested are rarely, if ever, charged or convicted in accordance with the law.<\/p> <p>Domestic violence continues to remain endemic in Iraq, including the serious abuse of LGBT people by their parents and relatives, as documented in 40 cases in this report. While Iraq\u2019s Penal Code (Law no. 111\/1969) criminalizes physical assault, article 41(1) gives a husband a legal right to \u201cpunish\u201d his wife and parents to discipline their children \u201cwithin limits prescribed by law or custom.\u201d The penal code also provides for mitigated sentences for violent acts, including murder, for \u201chonorable motives\u201d and catching one\u2019s wife or female relative in the act of adultery or sex outside of marriage.<\/p> <p>While the Iraqi constitution expressly prohibits \u201call forms of violence and abuse in the<\/p> <p>family,\u201d only the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) has a law on domestic violence. Iraqi parliamentary efforts to pass a draft law against domestic violence stalled throughout 2017-2021. The 2019 version of the draft anti-domestic violence law seen by Human Rights Watch includes provisions for services for domestic violence survivors, protection (restraining) orders, penalties for their breach, and the establishment of a cross-ministerial committee to combat domestic violence. However, the bill has several gaps and provisions that would undermine its effectiveness, including that it prioritizes reconciliation over protection and justice for victims.<\/p> <p>The following table sets out provisions in the 1969 Iraqi Penal Code that are used or could be used to target LGBT people, and their application. Many of these provisions are colonial-era relics that were kept following British rule, as well as Ottoman laws inspired by the French.<\/p> <p>Article 41(1) of the penal code provides that a husband to \u201cpunish\u201d his wife and parents can discipline their children within limits prescribed by law or custom. This law empowers parents to perpetrate violence against their LGBT children under the guise of \u201cdisciplining them,\u201d with impunity, even where they are adult children. For women who are married, who may identify as LBT, they can still face punishment by their husbands for straying gender roles and norms. Article 128 of the penal code identifies \u201cThe commission of an offence with honorable motives\u201d as a \u201cmitigating excuse.\u201d The article reads as follows: (1) Legal excuse either discharges a person from a penalty or reduces that penalty. Excuse only exists under conditions that are specified by law. Notwithstanding these conditions, the commission of an offence with honorable motives or in response to the unjustified and serious provocation of a victim of an offence is considered a mitigating excuse. This law allows perpetrators to largely or entirely escape punishment for abuses, even murder, committed against LGBT people, in the name of \u201cprotecting honor.\u201d Article 200 (2) of the penal code punishes with up to seven years\u2019 imprisonment anyone who promotes any \u201cmovement\u201d that seeks to \u201cchange the fundamental principles of the constitution or the basic laws of society.\u201d This provision could be used to restrict freedoms of expression, association, and assembly, or to penalize activists who work on \u201ctaboo\u201d issues. Article 210 of the penal code prohibits disseminating any information or idea that, among other things, \u201cdisturbs the public peace.\u201d This provision could be used to target LGBT activists who demonstrate support for LGBT rights or use pro-LGBT slogans. Article 394 (1) of the penal code punishes any person who, outside of marriage, has sexual intercourse with a woman with her consent, or commits buggery with a person with their consent, is punishable by a period of imprisonment not exceeding 7 years if the victim is between the ages of 15 and 18. If the victim was under the age of 15, the offender is punishable by a period of imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.\u201d This provision on sexual relations with a child could be used to prosecute LGBT people, especially when both consenting partners are under 18 and of similar ages. Article 398 of the penal code allows perpetrators of rape or sexual assault to escape prosecution or have their sentences quashed if they marry their victim. This article allows men to punish women who identify as LBT with rape or sexual assault and then escape punishment for the crime by marrying them. Families often consider women and girls subject to sexual assault as shameful and \u2018unmarriageable' and may force women to marry their rapists. Article 401 of the penal code states, \u201cAny person who commits an immodest act in public is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 6 months plus a fine not exceeding 50 dinars or by one of those penalties.\u201d The article is used against same-sex couples meeting in public places and against LGBT rights activists. Although official statistics are unavailable, all victims, witnesses, and survivors were aware that expressing their sexual orientation or gender identity in public would result in a possible arrest or a fine and said they avoided such instances. Article 402 (1) of the penal code punishes by a period of detention not exceeding 3 months and\/or a fine not exceeding 30 dinars \u201cany person who makes indecent advances to another man or woman.\u201d This law is used against same-sex couples meeting in public. Interviewees said they would not report attacks against them because they feared they may be charged under articles 401 or 402. Articles 403 and 404 of the penal code permit prison terms (up to two years under the first paragraph, up to one year under the second) for \u201cobscene or indecent\u201d publication or speech. These laws could be used to restrict free speech that promotes LGBT rights publicly. Article 409 of the penal code provides a reduced sentence of a maximum of three years imprisonment if the person catches one\u2019s wife or female relative in the act of adultery or sex outside of marriage and assaults them leading to their death or permanent disability. This provision provides that men can escape punishment entirely when killing or maiming women and girls by claiming that they found them in extramarital acts of sex. It sends a message that men can kill or injure women for their sexual acts. Article 502 of the penal code punishes \u201cany person who loiters in a public place or observes such a place with indecent intent or for an indecent purpose\u201d with up to 10 days\u2019 detention or a fine. This provision could be used to target LGBT people based on their gender expression, appearance, or actions in public.<\/p> <p>Political Context<\/p> <p>Government-Sponsored Anti-LGBT Campaign (Photo Infographic)<\/p> <p>Attacks against LGBT people in Iraq have long been a political tactic. While affirmative LGBT rights are mostly absent from formal political discourse, government officials and religious figures have made numerous anti-LGBT statements, which have served to undermine LGBT rights and fuel violence against LGBT Iraqis.<\/p> <p>In 2009, Iraqi armed group members began a far-reaching campaign of extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, and torture of men suspected of same-sex conduct or not conforming to masculine gender norms. Iraqi authorities did nothing to stop those killings. Although many armed groups in Iraq have claimed to be enforcers of their interpretation of Sharia (Islamic law), a 2009 Human Rights Watch report demonstrated how the killings\u2014committed without evidence or trial, based on prejudice and whim\u2014violated standards in Sharia law for legality, proof, and privacy.<\/p> <p>In 2012, several groups now within the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), armed groups nominally under the prime minister\u2019s control since 2016, including Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haqq, the Mahdi Army (now known as Saraya al-Salam), and Kata\u2019ib al-Ghadhab, backed in some cases by government armed forces, launched a wave of attacks on people categorized as part of the \u201cemo\u201d subculture, some of whom were perceived as LGBT.<\/p> <p>Signs and fliers appeared in the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City that threatened people by name with \u201cthe wrath of God\u201d unless they cut their hair short, concealed their tattoos, maintained \u201ccomplete manhood,\u201d and stopped wearing so-called \u201csatanic clothing.\u201d While it was unclear who was behind the campaign, at the time influential Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr called the targets of the campaign \u201ccrazy fools\u201d and a \u201clesion on the Muslim community\u201d in an online statement, but also maintained that they should be dealt \u201cwithin the law.\u201d<\/p> <p>In late 2012, following international pressure, the government responded by establishing an LGBT committee to address abuses against LGBT people. However, the committee took few tangible steps before disbanding.<\/p> <p>In 2014, with the rise of the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS), gay men, transgender women, and gender non-conforming people were at even greater risk. According to the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, the group executed at least 17 people in Syria and Iraq accused of sodomy or perceived to be gay between June 2014 and March 2015.<\/p> <p>In July 2016, Moqtada al-Sadr called for a ban on violence against those who do not conform to prevailing gender norms. Al-Sadr\u2019s statement expressed his view that same-sex relationships and cross-dressing are not acceptable, but that gender non-conforming people\u2014who al-Sadr claims are suffering from \u201cpsychological problems\u201d\u2014nevertheless deserved the right to live. \u201c[You] must disassociate from them [but] not attack them, as it increases their aversion and you must guide them using acceptable and rational means,\u201d the statement read.<\/p> <p>Despite these calls, the killings of LGBT people reportedly continued in Baghdad from 2017 to 2019 with Iraqi authorities seemingly doing nothing to stop them or punish those involved.<\/p> <p>In a wave of protests that began in October 2019 and continued into late 2020, with protesters demanding improved services and more action to curb corruption, clashes with security forces, including the PMF, left at least 487 protesters dead in Baghdad and Iraq\u2019s southern cities. LGBT people prominently participated in the protests, aligning their demands for protection and equal rights with the larger protest movement.<\/p> <p>On May 17, 2020, the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia (IDAHOBIT), a foreign embassy compound, including the European Union, the Canadian and British embassies in Baghdad, all raised a rainbow flag, a symbol of solidarity with LGBT people. This triggered condemnation in Iraq including from Moqtada al-Sadr on Twitter, parliamentarians, and the Foreign Ministry, who all claimed that the embassies were disrespecting Iraqi values and imposing a Western agenda.<\/p> <p>Since then, as this report documents, several gay men and transgender women have been murdered and dozens of LGBT people threatened. Members of armed groups began targeting people perceived as LGBT online, entrapping them on same-sex dating applications, and publicly calling for violence against them. Those linked to the attacks have not been prosecuted or held accountable in any other form, and prominent Iraqi figures have also condoned and incited the anti-LGBT discourse.<\/p> <p>Eight LGBT people interviewed said that after Moqtada al-Sadr\u2019s anti-LGBT tweet, it seemed to become more dangerous to be LGBT in Iraq.<\/p> <p>Also in May 2020, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi indicated a readiness to address ongoing human rights violations more generally but had not explicitly addressed the alarming spate of killings and threats against LGBT Iraqis.<\/p> <p>On November 7, 2021, al-Kadhimi survived an assassination attempt after drones loaded with explosives targeted his residence in Baghdad. The attack came two days after deadly protests led by the PMF in Baghdad, resulting in the death of a protester, over the disputed result of a general election on October 10, 2021, after which the PMF alleged vote-counting errors.<\/p> <p>Election results showed that a bloc led by Moqtada al-Sadr won 73 seats, maintaining its position as the largest group in Iraq\u2019s 329-member parliament. Meanwhile, the political arm of the PMF won 17 seats, down from 48 in the last parliament.<\/p> <p>II. Attempted Murder, Abductions, Torture, and Threats by Iraqi Armed Groups<\/p> <p>The following table sets out the different armed groups suspected to have been implicated in abuses against LGBT people documented in this report, based on individual and witness accounts.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch documented eight cases of abductions, eight cases of attempted murder, four extrajudicial killings, and forty-five cases of threats to rape and kill by Iraqi armed groups against LGBT people.<\/p> <p>The public nature of the abuses documented, mostly occurring in broad daylight in the streets, coupled with their chilling intentionality, signal the climate of impunity afforded to the perpetrators. The assailants aimed to send a message through the bodies of LGBT people they attacked, to the victims, other LGBT people, and society writ large. The arbitrary nature of the attacks demonstrates that individuals are targeted as part of a larger scheme to intimidate those who do not adhere to normativity and to punish aberration.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey Wanted Me Dead\u201d: Accounts of Survivors<\/p> <p>Khadija\u2019s Story<\/p> <p>Khadija, a 31-year-old transgender woman, has been subjected to egregious abuses by armed groups for over a decade. She said: \u201cI experienced horrendous forms of extreme torture by armed groups. I was beaten, raped, and burned. My friends were murdered. We witnessed the horrors of the Mahdi Army, Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-haqq, and Raba Allah. In 2012, two of my friends, Karrar and Anmar, had holes drilled into their heads with a drill and were injected with glue up their anuses.\u201d<\/p> <p>In February 2021, Khadija was attacked by a group of men with razor blades and screwdrivers near her aunt\u2019s house in Palestine Flats, Baghdad, where she was residing. The men, who Khadija said identified themselves as belonging to Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-haqq, a PMF group that had previously threatened her, poured gasoline on her body and set it on fire, burning her body parts from the chest down. She told Human Rights Watch and IraQueer:<\/p> <p>I was working at a hair salon. On my way back home, five or six men in a huge, tinted Hummer [truck] stopped next to me. They got out and told me to stop in my tracks. They kicked and punched and slapped me all over my head and body. They told me to get up and threw me in a garbage bin. I thought they were my last moments, and I was ready for that. I lay down on the garbage and they pulled out a razor blade and a screwdriver and poked and cut me all over, especially my ass, crotch, and thighs. They sliced me up and poured around five liters of gasoline all over my body and face and set me alight. I was screaming and tossing and turning from the burns, but I managed to protect my face. The neighbors rescued me. They came to my aid and threw water on me, covered me in a blanket and took me back to my aunt\u2019s house. I did not go to the hospital because it was shameful.<\/p> <p>At her aunt\u2019s house, Khadija said she was treated poorly by her aunt who refused to stitch her wounds. \u201cShe [my aunt] was waiting for me to die. I was in a terrible state and had toxins coming out of my body for six months, and I still am not completely healed,\u201d Khadija said.<\/p> <p>Khadija added that she felt horrified about her injuries, and the damage to her beauty and her body that she had always loved. She said she felt embarrassed to have a physical relationship because of her burns. She said:<\/p> <p>They [the attackers] wanted me dead. They have constrained my body, and I cannot love or be loved. I am ashamed of my body because of my current physical state. I even contemplated suicide. These groups, when killing and torturing LGBT people, focus on the sensitive areas of our bodies to inflict damage and mutilation as a kind of restriction and authority over the freedom of our bodies.<\/p> <p>Khadija told Human Rights Watch and IraQueer that the first attack against her dates to 2011, when four men who identified themselves as members of the \u201cMahdi Army,\u201d an armed group, forcibly entered her aunt\u2019s house where she was hiding. She said, \u201cThey blindfolded me, tied me up and covered my mouth. I did not scream at the time, how could I? They beat me with an iron rod, which broke my right leg, shaved my hair, and pulled out my nails. The effects are still visible on my body.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ayman\u2019s Story<\/p> <p>In March 2021, Ayman, a 20-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said members of his family, who belong to the PMF groups Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah and Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haqq, attempted to kill him. He said:<\/p> <p>I look different from others, and it started with family troubles. I\u2019ve never been out about my gender identity, they only assume it because of the way I look. In the beginning of the year [January 2021], after my father started showing up to my workplace and beating me up there, I left to stay over at my uncle\u2019s place who is a more authoritative figure of the armed group they belonged to but did not tell him the reason. My father came and there was a big brawl with guns, so I ran away, and they [my father and uncle] followed me. The neighbors brought me back and offered me shelter as my family waited outside with guns. It was very primitive and tribal. My father went to Najaf so he could obtain a fatwa about whether it is lawful\/pious to kill me.<\/p> <p>Ayman said three men who belonged to the same PMF group [Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah] as his father, came to his residence with handguns and machine guns, and they fired continuous shots at him. He said:<\/p> <p>It was attempted murder. I hid and was miraculously saved. My mother locked me up in a room to keep me safe. She took me to the police station to file a lawsuit, we thought it would be in our favor. No one was arrested throughout the four months of the lawsuit. I wasn\u2019t able to go to school or work even. My employer was threatened with murder if he kept me as an employee. He fired me. It was all a show of power.<\/p> <p>Ayman said a patriarch in his family eventually intervened to make amends and forced him to drop the lawsuit. While he remains in danger at home, he said he has nowhere to go for protection. He added, \u201cThey [my father and uncle] told me they will seek vengeance later.\u201d<\/p> <p>Rania\u2019s Story<\/p> <p>Rania, a 21-year-old transgender woman from Baghdad, was threatened online in May 2020 by unknown individuals, then kidnapped in June 2020 by men who she said identified themselves as members of Saraya al-Salam, a PMF group with close ties to Moqtada al-Sadr. She told Human Rights Watch and IraQueer:<\/p> <p>In May 2020, I received death threats on my phone number. They contained religious slogans, and the people called me by my full name and threatened to beat, rape, and kill me. I received daily threats until I changed my phone number and told my parents I lost mine.<\/p> <p>A month later, in June, when she was on her way to university one morning in Baghdad, Rania was abducted. She said:<\/p> <p>As I was about to get on the bus, a group of men emerged and told me to get into the car they were driving, which had tinted glass and no license plate. One of the men had a gun and held it to my head. I was terrified and didn\u2019t know whether to run or get in the car. I asked, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 And the man with the gun said, \u2018This gun has a silencer, if you don\u2019t get into the car, I will shoot you.\u2019 I got in. They blindfolded me and drove for about 30 minutes, until we reached a house. They pushed me into a room, closed the door, and left for about an hour. They held me in a room with the picture of Moqtada al-Sadr on the wall and threatened me while reciting religious slogans.<\/p> <p>An hour later, Rania said the attackers came back, all carrying guns, and started beating and cursing her. They said, \u201cYou are a faggot, you are a shame to Islam and this country. You like to take it in the ass? We will rape you and put this gun up your ass.\u201d Rania said she kept denying, but they said, \u201cWe know.\u201d \u201cKneel and pray your last prayer because we will kill you.\u201d She continued:<\/p> <p>I kept begging them not to kill me and I was sobbing. They said, \u2018Admit that you like to take it in the ass and that you will change.\u2019 They beat me so hard I felt I would die. Then under pressure I said, \u2018Yes, I will change.\u2019 They said, \u2018We will kill you because you are a faggot scum, we will clean our society from your likes.\u2019 They kept beating me, then suddenly left the room for a few minutes and then one man returned.<\/p> <p>He said, \u2018If you suck my dick, we will let you go.\u2019 I refused and kept begging them not to force me. I said, \u2018I\u2019d rather you kill me.\u2019 Then two additional men came in, one took off my shorts and the other raped me, then they took turns pinning me down and raping me. When they were done, they left the room, and I heard them talking. One said, \u2018We should let him go.\u2019 The other said, \u2018If we do, he will give away our location.\u2019 One of them came back and said, \u2018If we hear something like this again, it will be the end of you.\u2019 Then they pushed me to the street.<\/p> <p>Rania said she could not leave the house for weeks after her abduction. She stopped eating, failed her university exams, and attempted suicide, she said. \u201cRight now, I feel like the walking dead. I\u2019m only half alive.\u201d<\/p> <p>Salim\u2019s Story<\/p> <p>On March 7, 2020, Salim, a 20-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said he was working the night shift at a medical unit in Baghdad when an unknown man arrived at 1 a.m. and threatened him with death because he is gay. He said:<\/p> <p>He was masked and did not introduce himself. The next day, I went to the [anti-corruption] protests in disguise by covering my beard and mustache. After two days, they [perpetrators] were able to locate my residence by following me home.<\/p> <p>Salim said a group of four men followed him in a black Chevrolet Tahoe with tinted windows and no license plate. He added:<\/p> <p>I was able to dodge them during the many times they chased after me because I had a fast sports car. I felt I was being followed at the time because whenever I would go to a mall or the market, I would see the same people following me. They would go into the same shops I went to, but would wait outside if I entered, say, a minimarket; they had long beards, and wore green t-shirts.<\/p> <p>Salim said he refrained from returning home while he knew he was being followed, and he had elected to stay with friends for a month for his and his family\u2019s protection. During the first week of that month, Salim said they followed him at a distance. But the second week, while he was driving with a friend, he noticed that the same car was after them and dropped his friend off at another location to decoy them:<\/p> <p>They followed that friend for a while, and then other friends, until it got to a point where my friends were not in favor of seeing or hosting me anymore. I also closed all my social media accounts in May, I changed my number and my car even. I now operate under private profiles on social media because I was certain they were following me through my mobile number. I was certain because they were chasing me once and I made sure I lost them, then drove to my friend\u2019s place and found them there after a short while. The only way they could have found me was through my mobile number.<\/p> <p>Three months prior, Salim said he received a phone call at 2 a.m., which he answered, but there was no response on the other line. He added that the silent calls repeated for over 30 minutes. He said:<\/p> <p>After I got the same call the following day, I saved the number and searched it on WhatsApp. I found a photo of a 30- to 40-year-old guy with a beard [dressed in military attire]. I remember asking my family, relatives, and friends about him, but no one knew him.<\/p> <p>During the time he was dodging them by sleeping over at friends\u2019, and while he was in the Dora neighborhood driving to his friend\u2019s place, Salim said he noticed the same Chevrolet closing in on him. The men inside the car opened their windows, and the man in the passenger seat fired five shots at him with a gun:<\/p> <p>It was horrifying. They were not doing it to frighten me, because those shots were aimed at the driver\u2019s seat; they wanted to kill me. I was able to lose them by heading toward an area that is very familiar to me, passing three checkpoints without stopping.<\/p> <p>At the fourth checkpoint, Salim said police officers stopped him, handcuffed him, and began questioning him. He told the officers what was happening, and they said, \u201cWe won\u2019t hold you up for long,\u201d he said. They made him take an alcohol test because they were informed about his reckless driving at the previous checkpoints. They then seized his vehicle, he said.<\/p> <p>Salim cried as he recounted the incident:<\/p> <p>I am trembling as I remember what happened. Our community suffers tremendously, no one knows what we pass through. I did not stop crying and shaking after that car-chase. I lost them, but I will never forget.<\/p> <p>After the attempted killing, Salim told his parents he was being chased due to his participation in the protests, for fear of retaliation against him if he had revealed his sexual orientation to his parents. The family then had to relocate, he told Human Rights Watch. In June 2020, when his parents went to visit their old house, Salim said:<\/p> <p>My parents received a threatening letter\/envelope thrown at our front door [in the previous apartment]. The letter said that if they don\u2019t hand me in, they are going to kill us one by one.<\/p> <p>Mariam\u2019s Story<\/p> <p>Mariam, a 21-year-old lesbian from Baghdad, was identified by armed groups due to her appearance, and was stabbed in the leg by three men in blue caps (typical of armed groups allied with Moqtada al-Sadr) in May 2020. She said:<\/p> <p>Directly after Moqtada al-Sadr had tweeted about LGBT people on May 17, three men on a motorbike accosted me, beat me up, and stabbed me with a knife in my leg and cut up my arms. They said that they were from Saraya al-Salam and warned me to stop my immoral behavior. I was bleeding uncontrollably and thought I would bleed out. My friends helped me and bandaged my wounds.<\/p> <p>Yasser\u2019s Story<\/p> <p>Yasser, a 21-year-old Iraqi gay man, told Human Rights Watch that during the protests in November 2019, he was stabbed in the shoulder by unknown men who he suspected belonged to the PMF group Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haqq, because they had identified themselves in death threats against Yasser on WhatsApp. He said:<\/p> <p>One night my father beat me so badly I felt he was going to kill me. I ran away from home wearing only shorts and I was barefoot. I went to the protest square. Some men picked me up from the street. My friend, whom I work out with, was there with me. He is also gay. I will never forget what happened. Security forces started entering the bridge, throwing tear gas and sound bombs directly toward the protesters. Amid the chaos, three masked men approached us. They screamed \u2018faggot\u2019 at me and one of them stabbed me in the shoulder. Because I am so fit [my father forces me to work out so I would be a man], I ran away from them and hid under a truck. I could have died.<\/p> <p>Anwar\u2019s Story<\/p> <p>Anwar, a 21-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said that in 2018 he was abducted by Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, an armed group under the PMF. He said:<\/p> <p>I spent ten days in their secret prison, and they subjected me to physical torture. They were mostly in civilian attire, but some were wearing military attire akin to that of the Fasa\u2019il [armed groups]. I was in captivity at a farm in Baghdad. I spent four days at that secret prison, I was electrocuted and sexually tortured. They brought empty alcohol bottles and forced me to sit down on them, to have these bottles anally penetrate me. I suffered constant verbal abuse, like, \u2018You chick [farakh]! You Pup [jerou]!\u2019<\/p> <p>After he got out of the secret detention site, Anwar said he suffered from mental and physical ailments: \u201cI had to undergo two surgeries to my rectum and see a psychologist to process the trauma.\u201d<\/p> <p>Death Threats by Armed Groups<\/p> <p>Ammar, a 27-year-old gay man from Najaf, spoke about threats he received from members of a PMF group, Saraya al-Salam, in the street in October 2019. He said:<\/p> <p>I had a relationship with a coworker. We had sex at work, and we did not realize there were cameras in the room. During the beginning of the uprising in October 2019, I was in the protest square when a group of armed men, saying they are from Saraya al-Salam, approached me and said, \u2018We know who you are, and you will be killed like you deserve. We have the recording.\u2019 I did not leave my house after that.<\/p> <p>Salma, a 20-year-old transgender woman from Mosul, said that she fled to Erbil in 2020 because of death threats she had received from armed groups in Mosul. However, later that year individuals she suspected were Asayish members (the Kurdistan Regional Government\u2019s security forces) came to her workplace in Erbil to threaten her with death, which prompted her to leave her job and the city immediately.<\/p> <p>Leila, a 31-year-old transgender woman from Baghdad, told Human Rights Watch that she fled Iraq on October 15, 2018, with her boyfriend, a gay man, after they were informed that both their names are on a \u201cdeath list\u201d comprised of LGBT Iraqis\u2019 names. She said:<\/p> <p>We had a journalist friend who told us that there\u2019s something dangerous happening\u2014she got a hold of papers that have the names of \u2018civic engagers\u2019 and LGBT people in Iraq, who were listed for the armed group to kill. My name was on it. In 2018, I was walking on the street, and a car stops next to me, and the driver says, \u2018We will see you in the third opening,\u2019 which refers to the cemetery in my city.<\/p> <p>III. Witness Accounts of Killings and Threats by Suspected Armed Groups<\/p> <p>In late May 2020, my boyfriend was killed in front of me. I had a date with him at night, so I went to his house, and saw a black Honda car parked under his house. I stayed at a distance and watched him leave the building. Then four men got out of the car. I saw two of them had guns. They all had long beards. They beat him and forced him into the car and drove away. I followed them in my car. They stopped by Abu Ghraib [a former prison west of Baghdad] then took a left turn. They arrived at a big farm, they took out my boyfriend and started beating him. I heard him scream and sob. I wanted to help but I was terrified and didn\u2019t know what to do. They kept beating him for around 20 minutes. Then they shot him five times.<\/p> <p>\u2014Laith, 27-year-old Iraqi gay man, October 13, 2021<\/p> <p>Laith could not talk on the phone because he suffered a speech impediment after the death of his boyfriend. He told Human Rights Watch and IraQueer via text messages that he went back to the farm where his boyfriend was killed the next day and did not find his body. \u201cOnly some blood remained,\u201d he said. Laith added:<\/p> <p>At night his parents called me and asked if I knew where he was. I said I didn\u2019t. Three weeks later, his family said the police called them and said they found his dead body. I still don\u2019t know where they found the body or what they did to it. No one knew about our romantic relationship. We were both very secretive and hid our identities well.<\/p> <p>Laith said that in February 2020, he and his boyfriend received death threats online from two different accounts. According to Laith, one of the messages said, \u201cHi faggot. We know where you work and where you live. We will fuck you and kill you.\u201d Laith added:<\/p> <p>I received seven messages from different accounts. They sent me Moqtada al-Sadr\u2019s picture, and said, \u2018We have been cleaning the city from people like you for years.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think anything would happen because everyone receives threats online and most of the time nothing happens. After receiving these threats, my boyfriend said he felt like someone was following him. A couple of months later, he was killed.<\/p> <p>Laith said that after his boyfriend was killed, he moved cities, changed his phone number, and deleted all social media accounts. He feared that he would be targeted next because he had heard many stories in 2020 of people who were threatened online then killed, he told Human Rights Watch and IraQueer.<\/p> <p>Laith described the grief he felt over his boyfriend\u2019s death. He said, \u201cMy life is over. I\u2019m dead inside. Only my body is still here, but I\u2019m gone. The pain and terror I carry will never go away. I just hope the future generation doesn\u2019t have to suffer like we did.\u201d<\/p> <p>Yasser, a 21-year-old Iraqi gay man who survived a killing attempt, told Human Rights Watch about witnessing his friend\u2019s murder. Yasser wept while telling the story:<\/p> <p>On November 5, 2019, I saw my friend die in front of my eyes. Three masked men approached my friend and me, pulled out knives, and stabbed my friend repeatedly in front of me. He is also gay. I will never forget what happened. They kept stabbing him for what felt like forever. They addressed him and said, \u2018Faggot! Faggot! You are faggot scum and deserve to die.\u2019 One of them stabbed me in the shoulder, and I still don\u2019t know how, but I ran for my life. I could have been lying next to my friend.<\/p> <p>Doski Azad<\/p> <p>On January 28, 2022, Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman, was reportedly killed by her brother near Dohuk, a city in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI).KRI authorities found Azad\u2019s body on February 1. A spokesperson for the Dohuk police told the media that Azad\u2019s brother shot her twice before fleeing the crime scene.The Kurdistan Regional Government\u2019s security forces said they had opened an investigation into the killing and issued an arrest warrant against Azad\u2019s brother, who is presumed to be living in Germany, according to media reports.<\/p> <p>Ahmad Majed al-Mutairi (Hammoudi)<\/p> <p>In early October 2018, a video of a 14-year-old boy\u2019s murder in Baghdad was posted on Facebook and circulated widely on across social media platforms. The individual filming the victim, Ahmad Majed al-Mutairi, known as Hammoudi to his friends and family, could be heard in the video taunting him with homophobic slurs, while al-Mutairi laid on his side, bleeding from his abdomen, and pleading to see his mother.<\/p> <p>Al-Mutairi was popular on the social media platform Instagram, where he posted gender non-conforming pictures of himself with Snapchat [social media application] filters, appearing more \u201cfeminine.\u201d His friends, including a friend whom Human Rights Watch interviewed, said the teenager had been receiving threats on social media from fake accounts for months due to his appearance.<\/p> <p>According to witness statements, the perpetrators attacked al-Mutairi on the street in Baghdad\u2019s Yarmouk neighborhood and stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach. The individual filming the victim could be heard in the video asking al-Mutairi, \u201cWhat is your name? Where is your house?\u201d Al-Mutairi, short of breath and in tears, responded, \u201cHammoudi, four streets away.\u201d The individual filming asked, \u201cWere you at your friend\u2019s place? Who is your friend?\u201d Al-Mutairi answered, \u201cSajjad.\u201d He then asked, \u201cWhat is this coming out of me?\u201d The individual filming said, \u201cYour guts are out.\u201d Al-Mutairi then repeatedly pleaded, \u201cI want to see my mother.\u201d<\/p> <p>On November 16, 2021, Human Rights Watch interviewed one of al-Mutairi\u2019s close friends, who said he had previously been shot at by unknown men due to his hairstyle. He told Human Rights Watch:<\/p> <p>Hammoudi lived with his parents. He was at his friend\u2019s Sajjad\u2019s near his home and when he left, he was attacked and killed. It was Wednesday night. I don\u2019t know who the attacker is or who took the video. Hammoudi showed us [his friends] many threats he had received by armed groups because of his posts. I had heard about Sajjad [the friend whose name appears in the video], but I don\u2019t know him well because Hammoudi had his own group of friends in his neighborhood, then we hung out in another neighborhood. After his death, I fled the country because I feared I would be targeted next because of my appearance.<\/p> <p>Disappearances<\/p> <p>Imad, a 26-year-old man from Baghdad, spoke to Human Rights Watch about his friend who disappeared on June 23, 2021, ten days after he was threatened by PMF groups, who identified themselves in the messages. He said:<\/p> <p>I have a close friend [name withheld] who received three death threats by members of Saraya Al-Salam and Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah [PMF groups], which he showed me on his phone, because he is gay, but he never took those threats seriously. I advised him to do so but without resorting to the police because they would make matters worse. He disappeared on June 23, 2021, ten days after receiving these threats and I never heard from him again. He stopped responding to messages and his number was unreachable. I\u2019m afraid they killed him. If he relocated or sought refuge somewhere else, I am sure he would have reached out.<\/p> <p>Salim, a 20-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said:<\/p> <p>I took part in organizing LGBT parties at the Sheraton Hotel in Baghdad. My friend, who organized one of the parties that we called a \u2018ladies\u2019 night\u2019 in May 2020, was kidnapped. They [police] raided the party; it was a full-blown SWAT team like in the movies. The guy who organized the party had a fight with members of Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haqq [who appeared at the scene after the police arrived] who crashed the party because there was alcohol. One guy wanted to confiscate a box of Heineken beer that was at the party. I am certain they [police] came to the party because it had gays and women in it, as there are many other places that sell alcoholic beverages to underage individuals without any accountability. My friend [organizer] was imprisoned by the police for about a week, and when he got out, he was kidnapped for a month, but I don\u2019t know who kidnapped him. When they [perpetrators] returned him, he was broken and bruised all over, and we haven\u2019t heard from him since. He disappeared after the abduction. I tried to reach him everywhere and he was not even getting my messages. Even his family does not know where he is. He vanished. I believe he was killed. We never had any gatherings after that incident.<\/p> <p>In December 2020, Human Rights Watch reported on a case of disappearance of Arshad Heibat Fakhry. According to his brother, a group of unidentified armed men arrested Fakhry, 31, and a government minister\u2019s nephew on November 20, 2020, at 10:30 p.m. at the Ishtar Hotel in Baghdad. His brother told Human Rights Watch that every official they have spoken to about the case alleged instead that Fakhry had organized a party for LGBT people and had been in possession of drugs, both allegations the brother said were false. Fakhry\u2019s brother said he spoke to the other man arrested with Fakhry, who was released on November 22, 2020. That man told him he did not know who had arrested them or where they had been held, and that he was blindfolded and brought to his uncle\u2019s ministerial office and released there without any further information. Although he made multiple attempts to inquire about his brother\u2019s whereabouts with the Interior Ministry, the brother said he did not receive any information from the authorities.<\/p> <p>Montaser, a 26-year-old bisexual man from Kirkuk, spoke about the murder of his friend, Anmar, in 2018 in Baghdad. He said:<\/p> <p>It was armed groups who killed him, but I don\u2019t know which one. He was killed and thrown in the streets. We used to communicate via WhatsApp groups. We used to be three friends that invite LGBT people to the group to chat and that is how I knew him. He called me twice and told me about his parent\u2019s divorce and talked about his work and how good it was. We did tell him to be careful, he told us not to worry and said he knew high-ranking officers. He was called for a business deal and then disappeared for a week without a trace, and then we found out he was killed.<\/p> <p>IV. Sexual Abuse and Violence by Armed Groups<\/p> <p>Twenty-seven out of the fifty-four LGBT people Human Rights Watch interviewed said they had experienced sexual abuse and violence by state actors and armed groups, including unwanted touching, rape, gang rape, genital mutilation, and forced anal examinations.<\/p> <p>Article 396 of the Iraqi Penal Code outlines the punishment for sexual assault which can be forcible, or in cases committed against juveniles which constitute a crime even if it is non-forceful or consensual. The article provides as follows:<\/p> <p>(1) Any person who sexually assaults a man or woman or attempts to do so without his or her consent and with the use of force, menaces, deception, or other means is punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 7 years or by detention.<\/p> <p>(2) The penalty will be a term of imprisonment not exceeding 10 years if the person against whom the offence is committed is under 18 years of age or the offender is a person described in Sub-Article 2 of Article 393.<\/p> <p>Article 397 introduces aggravated sentences if the victim is under 18: \u201cAny person who sexually assaults a boy or girl under the age of 18 without the use of force, menaces or deception is punishable by detention. The penalty will be a term of imprisonment not exceeding 7 years or detention if the offender is a person described in sub-article 2 of article 393.\u201d<\/p> <p>Zoran, a 25-year-old gay man from Sulaymaniyah in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), told Human Rights Watch he was sexually assaulted by two members of the Asayish on November 4, 2021, around 9 p.m., while he was on a date with a man he met on the same-sex dating application Grindr. He said:<\/p> <p>He [my date] insisted that he wanted to hug and kiss me. I told him I was afraid they [Asayish] would find us. We decided to go to a park. When we parked our car, he insisted we go to the bathroom and kiss there. I was afraid someone would see us, but I trusted him, so I obliged. The moment we entered the bathroom, and he began kissing me, two Asayish officers knocked on the bathroom door then broke it and entered. They began beating me with a baton, on my legs, my chest, my back, my face, all over my body. They cursed me and called me a \u2018faggot.\u2019 One of them said, \u2018You look like a man, not a gay, why do you do this?\u2019 They threatened us with arrest and calling our families. One officer said, \u2018We will put you in prison for 15 years.\u2019 I tried to explain myself, but one officer caught my hand and demanded I go to his car with him.<\/p> <p>In the police car, Zoran said the officer asked him to download Grindr on his phone, which he did. He then proceeded to sexually assault him. Zoran said:<\/p> <p>He told me, \u2018You\u2019re very handsome, you need to be with someone older than you. You should be mine.\u2019 He touched my chest, my hand, my body, and my penis. He touched his penis while he was touching mine. While doing this, he asked me, \u2018What kind of penis do you like? Large? Small?\u2019 After he finished, he drove me to my car and let me go.<\/p> <p>Abbas, a 21-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said that in July 2021, he was subjected to sexual abuse by a police officer in the street in Baghdad. He said:<\/p> <p>I was listening to a podcast on my phone at 11 p.m. near Dora neighborhood in Baghdad, when a police officer approached me and started harassing me. He immediately pulled me close to him and started putting his hands on my body. I pushed him away. He asked me what I was doing there at night, then took my phone to check what I was listening to. He put his hand on my crotch and started caressing himself, then told me to walk with him toward a place with three other men, but I refused and ran away.<\/p> <p>Salma, a 20-year-old transgender woman from Mosul, was kidnapped and raped by members of a suspected armed group in early 2018. She said:<\/p> <p>I was walking in the street, then four men in fasa\u2019il [armed group] clothing approached me and said, \u2018You are a girl not a boy!\u2019 \u2018Why do you look like this?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re gay!\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re a faggot!\u2019 I suddenly found myself in a car with them. Three men took turns raping me and the fourth one watched. When they finished, I got out of the car and ran away. Now, even in Baghdad, I am very wary of going out in public. Since then, I tried to commit suicide three times. I never go out anymore.<\/p> <p>Khadija, a 31-year-old transgender woman, said:<\/p> <p>I met someone very influential in the Ministry of Interior, in a very high position in Baghdad. He had sex with me against my will. He also had weapons and guns with silencers. He gave me the numbers of people he wanted me to sleep with, and he said I should bring him back proof of that\u2014a used condom, pictures, audio. He told me to hide my phone [which he wanted me to use to get proof] in my anus so that they wouldn\u2019t find it. I left his place and immediately got myself to Kurdistan. I went to Sulaymaniyah and from there I went to Erbil and spent a year there. I went back to Baghdad and changed my phone, my residence, and everything that could lead that man to me.<\/p> <p>Mazen, a 20-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said in April 2020 he was stopped at a checkpoint in Karrada neighborhood:<\/p> <p>A police officer asked me to get out of the car. He asked about my name and age. I kept answering to avoid any problems. He said, \u2018I will not let you go before I get your number.\u2019 I did not know what to say, I was very confused, I was eventually forced to give him my number\u2014he called me to make sure it wasn\u2019t a fake number. At 1 a.m. I received a call, I rejected it and asked who it was over WhatsApp. I did not get a response and the number called again. When I answered, he told me that he was the officer who stopped me earlier and that he wanted to get to know me. I apologized and said that I was not interested, then I hung up.<\/p> <p>He called me repeatedly for a day-and-a-half, and I did not answer. Eventually, he sent me a WhatsApp message with [a description of] my car and my license plate [number] and told me that he would seize my car if I did not respond. When I met him, it was very bad. He drove me around in his car, and he took me to his apartment. I did not feel right being in that apartment and I told him I wanted to leave. He refused and raped me. I hated myself at the time. I cried and screamed and begged him to take me home. He drove me home, but I forgot my phone. I was shaken.<\/p> <p>In 2019, when Tatiana, a transgender woman from Basra, a city in southern Iraq, was 17, she was sexually assaulted by a man who said he belonged to a Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) unit. She said:<\/p> <p>I was going to take an exam in al-Qusour area, and I got lost in the building. I went to ask for directions, and a group of men in their mid to late 20s sat me down in their office and started harassing me. They asked for my number, and said they are with the Popular Mobilization Forces. I gave one of them my number just to get rid of him. He later asked me for sexual services, which I rejected. He started chatting with me three hours after our meeting, telling me that he likes me, then asked to go out with me. I was scared he would kill me, so I went out with him, in a government car. He took me to a depopulated area and forcibly had sex with me. Then he took me back home and I blocked him. He started calling from other numbers and threatening that he would tell my parents; he did that for a month. I don\u2019t know how he got all that information on me as I always made sure he dropped me at a distance from my house. He told me he knew all my personal details and my parents\u2019 too. This terrified me.<\/p> <p>V. Security Force Abuses<\/p> <p>In early 2021, I went to Liberation Square and there was a big brawl. I was a medic at the time. Police officers surrounded the whole area I was operating in and formed a blockade, and then caught me and beat me up in Khallani Square. I experienced several beatings like that one, causing fractures to my spine. They would search me in a very sexual way and make fun of my appearance. I could not say anything because there was a gun aimed at me. Everything seemed permissible to them, even murder.<\/p> <p>\u2014Mariam, 21-year-old Iraqi lesbian, July 23, 2021<\/p> <p>LGBT people across Iraq face routine violence from security officials, who verbally and physically assault them, arbitrarily arrest, and detain them, often without a legal basis. Interviewees reported that any suspicion of gender non-conformity may lead to violence or harassment by security forces. Human Rights Watch documented 15 cases of arrest by security forces against 13 LGBT people in Iraq.<\/p> <p>\u201cEndless Tragedy\u201d: Arrests, Violence, Harassment at Checkpoints<\/p> <p>Security checkpoints are ubiquitous throughout Iraq. At checkpoints security officers can stop vehicular traffic, search cars as well as individuals present in the vehicle, and may request that individuals passing through a checkpoint show their ID. The primary purpose of checkpoints is imposing surveillance on any threats to national security.<\/p> <p>The proliferation of checkpoints results in an abuse of power by security personnel, who regularly stop pedestrians they deem \u201cthreatening\u201d and may feel empowered to impose arbitrary surveillance on individuals they view as \u201csuspicious.\u201d<\/p> <p>Thirty-four of those interviewed by Human Rights Watch reported having been questioned at a checkpoint at least once.<\/p> <p>Mariam, a 21-year-old lesbian from Baghdad, said:<\/p> <p>This [being stopped at checkpoints] is an endless tragedy with me. There is one officer in my city who stops me every single time he spots me and asks me for my ID. He has memorized my name and details about me, including my place of residence. My ID photo mostly conforms with the way I look, but I have short hair and often dress in a way that doesn\u2019t show my feminine features like the rest of the girls. They would tell me, \u2018You\u2019re a man!\u2019 I always hear sayings like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re really a girl?\u2019 When my car leaves the checkpoint they say, \u2018She\u2019s a dyke!\u2019 This happens every single time.<\/p> <p>Mariam added:<\/p> <p>In early 2020, I was in the protest square when a car came and stopped me, then took me to a police station. They did not take me to a cell, only to the main hall at the station. Every now and then someone would come to me and ask me whether I was a boy or a girl. During the interrogation, they asked me personal questions, such as, \u2018If you\u2019re a girl, what were you doing there?,\u2019 \u2018Why do you look like that?,\u2019 \u2018Why do you dress this way?,\u2019 \u2018Do you have any illegal stuff on you?,\u2019 \u2018Why do you have this much money?\u2019 They would never let me answer properly, they would just ask one question and quickly move to the next one. I mentioned the name of a friend [woman] who acquires funds and aid items from the United States, and I told them to contact her; they released me directly after that. I did not have to sign anything because this happened before they could write up the police report.<\/p> <p>Razan, a 41-year-old transgender woman from Basra, said she was arrested by airport security in December 2018 on her return from Turkey at Baghdad airport. Razan said security officers verbally demeaned her because of her appearance and accused her of impersonating another person. She told Human Rights Watch:<\/p> <p>I was arrested for several hours. They asked me if my hair was natural or a wig, and the officer threw my passport on the ground and started humiliating me for how I look.<\/p> <p>Nasma, an 18-year-old transgender woman, said she had been stopped at checkpoints in Baghdad countless times, due to her gender expression. In 2020, when she was 17, Nasma was stopped at one of the checkpoints in al-Amil neighborhood in Baghdad. She said:<\/p> <p>They [police officers] began to sexually harass me, touching my body and pointing to my appearance to humiliate me. An officer asked for my number. I was forced to give him a number and I gave him an old one that was out of order.<\/p> <p>Sami, a 23-year-old gay man from Najaf, said he was stopped at a checkpoint while he was visiting the Holy Shrine of Imam Ali:<\/p> <p>The shrine is next to my house, so I didn\u2019t take my ID with me. While I was leaving before dawn, I started hearing people shouting at me to stop, they [police officers] pushed me and asked, \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 \u2018Where do you live?\u2019 They wanted to see my phone and bombarded me with questions: \u2018Why are you so keen on keeping your phone with you?\u2019 \u2018Give us your ID.\u2019 \u2018How about you spend the night in our caravan?\u2019 I told them that I come here every day and questioned why they would need my ID when I live very close by. After hours of sexual harassment and taunting, they let me go.<\/p> <p>Ali, an 18-year-old gay man from Karbala, said that in April 2018, when he was 15, he was stopped at a checkpoint near his home in Basra, where he was residing at the time. He said:<\/p> <p>They [police officers] stopped me for several hours at the checkpoint, solely because of the way I look, and for my long hair. They refused to let me pass unless I called my parents and they made sure they knew I was at this checkpoint. An officer told me to go home with him. He took my number and tried to reach me over WhatsApp. One of the police officers asked me, \u2018Does your family know you look like this?\u2019<\/p> <p>Masa, a 19-year-old transgender woman from Najaf, said that in late 2020 she was sexually harassed by a traffic officer. She said:<\/p> <p>I was on my way back home from school one day on the bus. As I was walking, a traffic officer followed me on his motorbike. He kept following me and he took my number and my social media details. He reached out to me over Facebook, he wanted to sleep with me.<\/p> <p>Mazen, a 20-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said he and his boyfriend were stopped by police in April 2019 while they were in their car:<\/p> <p>We were making out, and a police car suddenly approached us. They glanced at us and told us to get out immediately. They were two police officers from the federal police force command [according to their uniforms]. They asked us what we were doing and requested our IDs. They did not see that we were kissing but thought we were suspicious because of the way we looked. They did not spare us until we paid them around 50,000 dinars [US$34] as a bribe.<\/p> <p>Hamad, a 19-year-old gay man from Baghdad, said he was stopped at a checkpoint on March 13, 2020, at 8 p.m., in Khallani square in Baghdad. He said:<\/p> <p>They [police officers] stopped me and asked for my ID, which I did not have. Then, they took my phone to searched it. They searched Viber, Facebook, Instagram, messages, and WhatsApp. The officer then checked my photos, and he saw a rainbow flag and 14 private photos of me, which confirmed to him that I was gay. He proceeded to ask me very sexual questions. He wanted me to come with him to his apartment, so he could have his way with me. He threatened to arrest, torture, rape, and kill me if I didn\u2019t speak. I was held for four hours, until 12 a.m. He commented on my long hair and told me that he will hand me to armed groups to rape me. I was very scared, I turned pale. When I refused to have sex with him, he called his fellow officers over and they also threatened to arrest and assault me. He blatantly told me that he would rape me if he saw me again, then he let me go.<\/p> <p>Montaser, a 26-year-old bisexual man from Kirkuk, said National Security Agency (NSA) officers stopped him at Baghdad Airport in June 2018. He said:<\/p> <p>It was 11 a.m. and the officer was supposed to stamp my passport so that I may leave, and the security officer refused and said, \u2018Not so fast, it\u2019s not always that we come across such a face.\u2019 \u2018You are prettier than my girlfriend,\u2019 another officer said. They [the two officers] insisted I come with them, and I went along because they had my passport. Before we got to the office, I got overwhelmed and shouted at them. \u2018Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourselves?!\u2019 \u2018What are you trying to do, it\u2019s Ramadan!,\u2019 I cried out. Their supervisor then came and let me go.<\/p> <p>On November 22, 2019, Montaser said he was stopped at al-Shaab checkpoint in northern Baghdad:<\/p> <p>They [police officers] kept saying things like, \u2018How pretty,\u2019 \u2018So fuckable,\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s sparkling.\u2019 The officer wanted to arrest me, and while he walked me to the station, he tripped and dropped my passport in the mud, getting it wet.<\/p> <p>Montaser said that after the incident, his passport was ruined, and he described the \u201ctedious and bureaucratic\u201d process he underwent to issue a new passport in Iraq:<\/p> <p>The process took two months, and I would be sexually harassed and groped every time I stepped into the police station or court. \u2018Are you a she-male?\u2019 \u2018No, you\u2019re a chick [Farakh],\u2019 officers would say. They kept yelling all the obscene things they would do to me, and they pushed me around. At the police station, an older high commissioner took me aside and asked for my number and Facebook account to \u2018make the process faster for me.\u2019 That night, he called me and started harassing me. He said things like, \u2018My love, I want to travel with you. My house is empty, come over.\u2019 I blocked him.<\/p> <p>In July 2020, Montaser said a chief officer at a police station in Baghdad called his friend, who works for the police, to inquire about him. He said, \u201cWhere\u2019s that pretty boy [Montaser]?\u201d Then the chief officer proceeded to convince his friend to start a fake fight with Montaser to get them to arrest him, so the officer could have sex with him, he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cYou Will Never Get Out\u201d: Ill-Treatment and Torture in Detention<\/p> <p>LGBT people who were detained, similar to other Iraqis who experience detention, reported being forced to sign pledges stating that they were not subjected to abuse in detention and being denied access to a lawyer. The conditions of their detention included being denied food and water, the right to access family and legal representation, the right to obtain medical services, being sexually assaulted and physically abused. One 18-year-old man reported being subjected to a forced anal exam when he was 17 years old, and another 18-year-old man said police officers attempted to subject him to an anal exam when he was 17. Anal tests, internationally discredited, can rise to the level of torture and sexual assault under international law.<\/p> <p>Karim, an 18-year-old gay man from Najaf, was 17 when he was arrested on October 2, 2020, at 3 p.m., at a checkpoint in Baghdad, while he was returning to Najaf. Karim said:<\/p> <p>They [police officers] stopped me because I had long hair. They searched my bag, which contained boxes of nutritional supplements due to my previous infection with Covid-19 and accused me of taking narcotic pills. They also accused me of doing sex work. They called intelligence services and told them they caught me on a motorcycle with drugs in my possession, which was false.<\/p> <p>Karim said that police officers took him to a caravan near the checkpoint, and one of the security personnel inside the caravan touched his crotch during the inspection, while the rest of the officers were laughing. The police insulted Karim by saying things like, \u201cIf you look like this, then how about your mother and sisters? We will sell you to prisoners. If you enter prison, you will never get out.\u201d<\/p> <p>Police officers searched Karim\u2019s phone, he said, and after seeing pictures of personalities such as Safaa al-Saray, a human rights activist killed during the October 2019 protests in Tahrir Square in central Baghdad, the authorities accused Karim of \u201cbeing a Tishreen [protester].\u201d When they saw the kufiyah (traditional Middle Eastern headdress) in Karim\u2019s bag, one of the officers said, \u201cAre you trying to be a Palestinian terrorist?\u201d Karim said.<\/p> <p>Karim said police officers wiped a tissue paper across his face to check if he was wearing makeup. The officers then took Karim to the police station near Dora in Baghdad. During the investigation, Karim said they asked him, \u201cAre you a Sunni or a Shia? Why did you come to Baghdad? Are you a prostitute? How much money do you charge? What tribe [\u2018ashira] do you belong to?\u201d<\/p> <p>At Dora police station in Baghdad, Karim said:<\/p> <p>I was with 14 police officers in a tiny space, and they bombarded me with slander, offensive language, verbal, sexual and physical harassment, and threats with rape and imprisonment. They took demeaning photos of me. They pushed me around. This happened while I waited for someone to come undress and examine me. One of the police officers touched my crotch and said, \u2018You can say how much you charge for one night, then I will release you.\u2019 I was a child.<\/p> <p>Karim added that officers called his parents, asking them to come on the same day, or he would be imprisoned.<\/p> <p>Karim said he was transferred to a room containing a mattress, several medical tools, and arrest files, for a forced anal examination. He told Human Rights Watch:<\/p> <p>While I was trying to undress, there were several security personnel surrounding me. One of them sexually assaulted me by touching my private parts.<\/p> <p>According to Karim, before he was released on bail the next day, he was forced to sign a pledge that he had not been subjected to any verbal or physical abuse. He said he was also forced to sign an agreement that he would not enter Baghdad again. After his detention, Karim said he became depressed and attempted suicide several times.<\/p> <p>Karim said his father, a former soldier, verbally abused him while aiming a gun at him. He kept him in his room in the house for an extended period and told him that he had lost his honor and would never be a man, Karim said. \u201cHe [my father] threatened to kill me if I were to be arrested again.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ali, an 18-year-old gay man from Karbala, said he was arrested three times when he was a child. In 2019, when he was 16, Ali was arrested at a checkpoint near his home in the Zubair area in Basra, after returning from the cinema with his cousin. He said:<\/p> <p>One of the main checkpoints near my house stopped me. They asked for my ID, which I did not bring because I did not think I had to bring my ID every time I went out to a place like I was always a suspect. Then they took me to the police station, and all the officers took turns verbally harassing me. They asked me about my sexual relationships. Then one of them said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you come to have sex with us?\u2019 They threatened to detain me, then they forced me to cut my nails with a sharp blade from the center so that I could get out. I signed a pledge and came out of the center with my fingers bleeding. I was terrified.<\/p> <p>In November 2020, when Ali was 17, police officers arrested him at a checkpoint in Baghdad and took him to a nearby police station in Arab Jibor. Ali said:<\/p> <p>I was detained for around eight hours in total. While they [police officers] were taking me to the police station, they verbally harassed and bullied me for my appearance. They put me in a small room with more than ten officers, including the chief officer, several police officers, and a traffic officer. They began to write the police report. They searched me from head to toe, and insisted on taking my phone, even though I had refused. They got visibly upset and asked me about my refusal, to which I claimed that I had private family photos. They were adamant on imprisoning me. They made me call my parents and tell them I was detained.<\/p> <p>On the way to the police station, Ali said a police officer pushed him against a pile of weapons that the officers had placed in the caravan, causing him bruises. Ali spoke about the 8-hour interrogation he was subjected to by police officers. He said:<\/p> <p>They were searching for evidence that I was gay but could not find any. They asked me, \u2018How much money do you get paid in exchange for sex?\u2019 The interrogation never stopped, they asked questions that were mostly religious, \u2018Why are you a Shia coming to a Sunni area to do prohibited [sexual] affairs?\u2019, \u2018Come have sex with us. We are Shias like you. You are a faggot.\u2019 They asked me about my Facebook profile. I was extremely anxious throughout that whole time, and I experienced shortness in breath. I asked them for medical help and for water, but they did not help with anything, not even water.<\/p> <p>Ali said that the officers wanted to subject him to a forced anal examination but said they would wait until \u201che got to prison.\u201d He added that the arrival of a colonel from his hometown saved him. \u201cThe colonel asked where I was from, and it turned out we were from the same religious minority. He then instructed the officers to leave me in the room until my parents came, and not to take me to prison,\u201d Ali said.<\/p> <p>Before his father paid bail to secure his release, Ali said police officers forced him to sign a pledge stating that he was not subjected to any harassment or ill-treatment during detention.<\/p> <p>In 2021, Ali was stopped by an armed group called Hashd al-Atabat in Karbala governorate in central Iraq, where he was taking photographs of buildings, due to his \u201cshameful appearance,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the armed group\u2019s leader came, he told his men to cut my hair and then let me go.\u201d<\/p> <p>Masa, a 19-year-old transgender woman from Najaf, said she was arrested in March 2018, when she was 16. She said:<\/p> <p>I was in a relationship with a man from Baghdad who came to visit me in Najaf. He wanted to visit the A\u2019taba [holy shrine]. I do not usually go there because of the way I look. We went, and some people ratted us out to the security forces in the area. We were taken to a nearby police station under the suspicion that we met to have sex, though that was not our intention. They forcibly took our phones and searched them. They were certain that I was trans because of pictures on my phone. My companion and I were separated and put in different rooms. After that, most of the officers at the station sexually harassed me by groping me and grabbing my ass along with vile speech like we are \u2018faggots.\u2019 They did that while they were interrogating us and searching our belongings. They told me they were going to perform an anal test on me, but I cried and begged them not to. They also beat up my companion. It was very demeaning treatment. I was terrified.<\/p> <p>Arrest Warrants against Activists in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI)<\/p> <p>In June 2021, police in the KRI issued arrest warrants against eleven LGBT rights activists, including three lawyers, two social workers, a driver, and five activists, who are either current or former employees at Rasan Organization, a Sulaymaniyah-based human rights group. The arrest warrants followed a lawsuit against Rasan by Barzan Akram Mantiq, the head of the Department of Non-Governmental Organizations in the KRI, a state body responsible for registering, organizing, and monitoring all nongovernmental organizations in the KRI.<\/p> <p>Activists implicated in the lawsuit told Human Rights Watch that when their lawyer visited the police station to inquire about the charges, police officers at the station referred to the written lawsuit, which indicated charges under article 401 of Iraq\u2019s Penal Code, which punishes \u201cpublic indecency\u201d with up to 6-months\u2019 imprisonment, and\/or a fine of up to 50 dinars (US$0.034).<\/p> <p>On June 28, two of the activists and the driver said they went to the Sarchnar police station in Sulaymaniyah for interrogation. Police officers at the station inquired about the organization\u2019s activities, namely their Facebook page, which contained pro-LGBT statements and images, the activists said. Officers also indicated that the organization\u2019s registration expired in 2018. Activists said police officers asked: \u201cIf you are registered as a women\u2019s rights organization, why do you have LGBT-related content on your website and Facebook page?\u201d Before leaving the police station, police officers made them sign pledges that they would not publish similar content in the future, activists said.<\/p> <p>Activists told Human Rights Watch that they were forced to take down LGBT-related content from their public online pages. At time of writing, although none of the activists had been arrested, they were informed that the case was now with the court and was pending investigation.<\/p> <p>The arrest warrants violate Iraq\u2019s constitution and its obligations under international law. Article 39 of the Iraqi Constitution provides for the freedom of establishment of any association, organization, or political party, while the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iraq is a state party, prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in upholding the rights to free expression, assembly, and association.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey Would Turn Against Me\u201d: Impunity and Reluctance to Report Abuse<\/p> <p>The combination of hypervulnerability, loosely defined \u201cmorality\u201d clauses, and the absence of anti-discrimination legislation and reliable complaint systems, are formidable barriers that impede LGBT people\u2019s ability and willingness to report abuses they suffer to the police, or file complaints against law enforcement agents, creating an environment in which police and armed groups can abuse them with impunity.<\/p> <p>In addition, victims sometimes choose not to file complaints against law enforcement and armed groups due to threats, fear of retaliation, and fear of public exposure of their identities. Most individuals interviewed also lack faith in the criminal justice system to deliver justice, part of a broader problem of trust in public institutions in Iraq.<\/p> <p>Access to redress is particularly difficult for members of vulnerable groups. While there are mechanisms in place to file formal complaints, logistical, social, and structural obstacles render the system woefully inadequate to ensure accountability for wrongdoing, especially against LGBT people. All 54 LGBT people interviewed for this report said that they would not report a crime committed against them to the police, either because of previous failed attempts where the complaint was dismissed or no action was taken by police, or

Sheikh and his three aides - Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman Saqib - were convicted and sentenced in the abduction and murder case of Pearl in Karachi in 2002. Blinken said: Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh was indicted in the United States in 2002 for hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, resulting in the murder of Pearl, the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, as well as the 1994 kidnapping of another United States citizen in India.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe court's decision is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan, he said. We expect the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options to ensure justice is served.

We are also prepared to prosecute Sheikh in the United States for his horrific crimes against an American citizen,\" Blinken said.<\/p> <p>The United States is committed to securing justice for Pearl's family and holding terrorists accountable, he said. Pearl's murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.<\/p> <p>He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.

Kotey, 37, pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court in Alexandria to playing a role in the kidnappings and deaths of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller. The three men were beheaded on camera in videos posted online. The circumstances of Mueller\u2019s death remain unclear.<\/p> <p>All four traveled to Syria, their friends and family have said, out of an intense desire to help - either by reporting on the war there or giving aid to those displaced by the conflict.<\/p> <p>Kotey\u2019s plea marks the first time a member of the Islamic State has been held accountable in a U.S. court for those killings. He faces a mandatory life sentence.<\/p> <p>In exchange for his admission of guilt and promised cooperation, prosecutors agreed that after Kotey serves 15 years in a U.S. prison, he may seek to serve the rest of his sentence in the United Kingdom, where he was born. If that happens, Kotey also agreed he would plead guilty in a United Kingdom prosecution and face a life sentence there, and be returned to the United States if released by the U.K.<\/p> <p>The government agreed to the possible transfer because three British men were also abducted by the same terror group, and two, aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, were slain.

He and Emwazi attended the same mosque and traveled to Syria together in 2012.<\/p> <p>The United Kingdom, which had revoked the pair\u2019s citizenship, aided the U.S. prosecution after assurances the men would not face the death penalty.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe justice, fairness and humanity that this defendant received in the United States stand in stark contrast to the cruelty, inhumanity and indiscriminate violence touted by the terrorist organization he espoused,\u201d Raj Parekh, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said after the hearing. \u201cToday, through the voices and lives of the victims, justice spoke, and it is those words that will resonate through history.\u201d<\/p> <p>In court, Kotey read a statement in which he said he was \u201cprincipally involved in every process of these negotiations\u201d of trying to extract ransom from the United States, including emails and the \u201cproof-of-life videos and emails\u201d sent to the hostages\u2019 families. \u201cThis role of mine required that I at times engage in acts of violence against the captives in order to subdue them, in order to compel those western governments, including the United States, to act fast and cooperate with our demands. I had no doubt that any failure of those foreign governments to comply with our demands would ultimately result in either the indefinite detention of those foreign captives, or their execution.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said he also served as a sniper for the Islamic State.<\/p> <p>Prosecutors have alleged that both Kotey and Elsheikh were involved in the Islamic State\u2019s attempts to extract ransom from prisoners\u2019 families through calculated brutality.<\/p> <p>Kotey instructed hostages to kneel and watch a Syrian prisoner\u2019s execution while holding signs begging for their release, prosecutors said.<\/p> <p>Under President Barack Obama, the military tried and failed to rescue the four American hostages.<\/p> <p>Foley, 40, a freelance journalist working for the Boston-based GlobalPost, was abducted along with a British translator in November 2012. GlobalPost said it worked desperately to rescue Foley, but video of his death was released in August 2014.<\/p> <p>Sotloff, 31, was also a freelance journalist, raised in Florida, who was abducted near Aleppo in August 2013. Video of his death was released in September 2014.<\/p> <p>Mueller, 26, was a humanitarian aid worker from Arizona who had worked with agencies such as Doctors Without Borders when she was kidnapped in August 2013. Her family received an email with photos confirming her death in February 2015.<\/p> <p>Kassig, 26, was a former Army Ranger from Indiana who founded a humanitarian aid group for refugees and was on his way to deliver food and medical supplies to refugees when he was abducted in October 2013. Video of his death was released in November 2014.<\/p> <p>The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria reached its peak in 2015, and as the group\u2019s territory shrunk, the campaign of public beheadings ended.

The latter could force drivers who are sick or self-isolating into work.<\/p> <p>Unite regional secretary Ritchie James immediately called for negotiations aimed at ending the dispute, saying, \u201cThey are being forced by Go North West to choose between their jobs and huge cuts in their pay and conditions. Unite is now providing Go North West with a very short window of opportunity, where it can tear up its fire and rehire plans. If the company fails to grasp this opportunity then Unite will not hesitate in calling strikes.\u201d<\/p> <p>News website aboutmanchester reported that drivers have been given hand-delivered letters stating that if they do not sign the new contracts, then \u201cGo North West is issuing you with notice of the termination of your employment, which shall end on 8 May 2021.\u201d The article said drivers have only until February 16 to decide whether or not to accept the new contract.<\/p> <p>In a consultative ballot held September last year, drivers voted by a 94 percent majority to be prepared to strike. The union did not proceed to a strike ballot, instead appealing to the Go Ahead group\u2014\u201call of your stakeholders, partners and associates, including our significant political network in the Nordic countries, Germany and Australasia\u201d\u2014to pressure Go North West to drop their plans.<\/p> <p>Unite also made proposals to save the company \u00a31 million a year, and said it was prepared to accept a year-long pay freeze to save the company an additional \u00a3200,000. The company is demanding more, and the union was forced to call the strike ballot.<\/p> <p>UK telecom workers engineers vote to strike<\/p> <p>A ballot of 170 Repayment Project Engineers (RPE) working for UK telecom company BT\u2019s Openreach division produced an 86 percent majority on a 94 percent turnout to strike. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) members oppose company plans to unilaterally impose regrading of their posts.<\/p> <p>The vote by the RPEs to strike follows a consultative vote of CWU members across BT Openreach and EE announced in December last year. On a 70 percent turnout in that ballot, nearly 98 percent voted in favour of striking to defend jobs, terms and conditions.<\/p> <p>Rather than acting on the ballot result, the union is seeking to pressure the company to retract the regrading. CWU national officer for Openreach, Davie Bowman, wrote to senior management saying, \u201cIt is clear from that result our members have demonstrated, once again, their clear opposition to the movement of the RPE role from the team member grading structure. The CWU believe the company should reflect on the outcome of the statutory ballot and urgently meet with the CWU.\u201d<\/p> <p>Union ends strike of DHL drivers and warehouse staff in northwest England<\/p> <p>Unite ended the strike by UK delivery drivers and warehouse workers at DHL Supply Chain, in Croxteth, Liverpool, after agreeing a paltry wage settlement. They had been due to strike Monday and Tuesday this week. The 120 Unite union members who work for DHL on a delivery contract for Burton Biscuits and AB World Foods had taken 10 days of action.<\/p> <p>Strikers demanded a pay increase and an end to victimisation of union members. They were paid \u00a38.94 an hour, just two-and-a-half pence above the new minimum wage rate coming into effect in April. Unite regional officer Kenny Rowe said several members were \u201csuspended or sacked on spurious charges, due to management victimisation.\u201d During the strikes in December, management called the police to picket lines on at least 10 occasions, involving up to three police vehicles at a time.<\/p> <p>Unite initially called a strike after negotiations under the auspices of the Advisory and Conciliation Arbitration Service collapsed. Unite called for a pay rise of just 50p an hour above the minimum wage. The union then called off planned action in December, offering further talks to DHL. They were forced to reinstate the action in late December as talks proved fruitless.<\/p> <p>Under the agreement between DHL and Unite, workers will be given a three percent rise for 2020 backdated to April last year, followed by a three percent rise this year plus a one-off \u00a375 payment. This will leave the DHL workers on around \u00a39.50 an hour, 60p above the minimum wage rate set in spring.<\/p> <p>Scottish college lecturers\u2019 ballot for strike action<\/p> <p>Lecturers in Scottish Further Education colleges are taking part in a consultative ballot over plans by the national employment body, Colleges Scotland, to replace college lecturer posts with instructor\/assessor posts. The new posts would be open to less qualified staff, on lower pay and inferior conditions.<\/p> <p>Lecturers at Forth Valley college have been involved in industrial action over what amounts to a fire and rehire threat by management.<\/p> <p>The Educational Institute of Scotland-Further Education Lecturers Association members has called an online rally.<\/p> <p>UK court security staff strike vote<\/p> <p>Around 300 UK court security staff working for contractor OCS have voted to strike, rejecting a pay offer of 13p an hour. The Public and Commercial Services union members voted by more than 90 percent on a two-thirds turnout to strike. The workers also want sick pay paid from day one, and 30 days leave.<\/p> <p>Union calls off IT staff strike at Brighton University after agreeing a redundancy<\/p> <p>A strike by IT staff at the University of Brighton on England\u2019s south coast, due to begin Monday, was called off after the University and College Union (UCU) agreed to voluntary redundancy. Workers were opposing compulsory redundancy plans as part of restructuring of the IT department, under which a third of staff would be made redundant.<\/p> <p>The workers took several strike days in December and were working to rule.<\/p> <p>A statement agreed by the UCU and university said: \u201cUCU and the University have met today (5\/2\/21) regarding the dispute in connection with the reorganisation of IS. The dispute is resolved as the individual concerned is now leaving the university voluntarily. As a result, the UCU has agreed to call off its industrial action. The University has given assurances that no repercussions will be felt by those who took part in industrial action and recognises that working hours lost through industrial action cannot be rescheduled. Both parties look forward to working together constructively on the significant future challenges facing the sector, the university and our students.\u201d<\/p> <p>UK pharmacists may strike as they face overwhelming debts<\/p> <p>Indebted community pharmacists in the UK\u2014on the front line in the pandemic, as many GP practices only offer telephone consultations\u2014are considering strike action.<\/p> <p>The government loaned \u00a3370 million to pharmacies last year to cope with the COVID-19 crisis. The loan is due to be repaid this year. Pharmacists are urging the government to waive the repayment, saying many community pharmacies are in debt and paying back the loan would push them into bankruptcy.<\/p> <p>The Guardian quoted Andrew Lane, chairman of the National Pharmacy Association, saying, \u201cThis is a desperate situation for many of our members, so it\u2019s not surprising that you do hear people talking about some form of protest. But no one wants to let their patients down, so strike action is the last thing any pharmacist would want to do. Instead, we need to continue to make the evidence-based case and appeal to the government to do the right thing by the nation\u2019s heroic pharmacists and the patients they serve.\u201d<\/p> <p>In contrast to pharmacists, GP practices had costs of \u00a3197.5 million reimbursed in recognition of the extra workload due to the pandemic. Dentists, too, had financial help.<\/p> <p>In 2009, pharmacists in Ireland took 10 days of strike action protesting cuts in payments by the Irish government.<\/p> <p>Port workers strike in Hamburg, Germany<\/p> <p>Around 350 technical workers at state-owned HHLA subsidiaries SCA and SCB, Hamburg, held a three-day stoppage February 2\u20134, following a one-day strike the previous week. The Verdi union members are demanding that an agreement covering weekend work week be brought into line with conditions in other northern German ports.<\/p> <p>Under the current agreement for most port workers, a regular 40 hour working week is spread Monday to Saturday. With 30 days leave per year this amounts to a 35-hour week. Sundays are not included in working out the working week figure. However, for SCA and SCB employees, Sundays are counted as a normal working day, so they end up working more weekends than colleagues at other ports.<\/p> <p>HHLA want to maintain the flexible working hours system to enable Hamburg to better compete with other ports in northern Europe.<\/p> <p>Middle East<\/p> <p>Egyptian fertiliser workers continue sit-in<\/p> <p>Workers at the Delta Company for Fertilisers and Chemical Industries at Daqahlia, in Egypt\u2019s Nile delta, are continuing their sit-in protest.

The sit-in is supported by workers\u2019 families.<\/p> <p>Africa<\/p> <p>Nigerian university administration workers\u2019 national walkout as union sells out teachers\u2019 strike<\/p> <p>University workers in Nigeria walked out midnight on February 5. The strike is over the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (a new computer system used to handle salary payments), non-payment of the minimum wage, delays in negotiations, and failure to honour an agreement from 2009.<\/p> <p>Leaders of the SSANU (Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities) and NASU (Non-Academic Staff Union of the Universities) said the strike would go ahead \u201cpending any contrary resolution by the branches.\u201d<\/p> <p>A three-week stoppage by teachers in Edo state ended February 8, when the national leadership of the Nigerian Union of Teachers intervened. Workers\u2019 demands including unpaid salaries were not met.<\/p> <p>Overworked doctors at South African hospital protest<\/p> <p>Doctors at Dr Harry Surtie Hospital, Upington, Northern Cape, South Africa walked out February 3, to protest staffing levels and overwork. They are demanding the appointment of another 10 medical officers and four community service doctors, or they will strike.<\/p> <p>The hospital is staffed by 36 doctors, which they say is inadequate to serve the local population. In a letter to management, they state \u201cthe COVID-19 wards are full and no doctors have been appointed to work in these wards.\u201d They are expected to work an extra 110-140 hours a month in excess of their 40-hour week, leading to burnout.<\/p> <p>South Africa has 1,482,412 cases of COVID-19 with 44,145 deaths.<\/p> <p>South African municipal workers in Port Elizabeth walk out in protest over wages and conditions<\/p> <p>Over 200 municipal workers in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, South Africa stopped work Tuesday and protested outside the provincial government offices.<\/p> <p>The South Africa Municipal Workers Union members are demanding a COVID-19 compensation allowance, discounts on electricity and water, the ending of outsourcing and permanent employment of all contract workers. Union representatives are currently in discussion with the municipality.<\/p> <p>South African animal feed workers at Humansdorp Co-operative dismissed after striking for wage increase<\/p> <p>Workers at the Humansdorp Co-operative animal feed plant in Cookhouse, Eastern Cape, South Africa were dismissed after walking out in protest over wages. The 25 forklift truck drivers and food mixers at the plant said they should be paid as skilled workers, and also complained their contracts were written in Afrikaans.<\/p> <p>The company said the strike was \u201cunprotected\u201d and gave notice of dismissal on February 4, suggesting workers go to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) if they wanted to contest the decision. Employers know the CCMA is currently struggling to cope with a backlog of cases after having its budget massively slashed, making it difficult for workers to access services.<\/p> <p>Shop stewards dismissed by Volkswagen in South Africa<\/p> <p>Fourteen trade union shop stewards at the Volkswagen car plant in Uitenhage, South Africa, sacked at a disciplinary hearing in January, will dispute the decision at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration February 15. The South African Federation of Trades Unions held a demonstration outside the factory February 3, and future protests are planned.<\/p> <p>The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) stewards were originally suspended last year, when workers walked out July 17 after returning to work from the COVID-19 lockdown to find themselves exposed to unsafe conditions. When the firm threatened the entire workforce with dismissal, workers went to the Department of Employment and Labour to enforce their rights, and the international company was found to have violated health and safety regulations. The stewards were reinstated but were sacked after the disciplinary hearing, which accused them of \u201cinciting\u201d the 2020 strike.<\/p> <p>NUMSA General Secretary Irvin Jim said members now have no union representatives at the factory and management refused to meet him.<\/p> <p>Twenty years ago, 1,300 workers from the Uitenhage plant were sacked while on strike in defence of elected stewards, who had been suspended from office by NUMSA. The union leadership collaborated closely with VW management in ousting the militant shop stewards and the workers supporting them from the plant to prevent further industrial action.<\/p> <p>Liberian workers confront House of Representatives Speaker to demand payment of arrears<\/p> <p>Workers from the House of Representatives in Liberia besieged the official vehicle of the Speaker of the House on February 4, to demand payment of 17 months\u2019 arrears of unpaid salaries.

The reforms will allow migrant workers to change jobs without employer permission and set a higher minimum wage for all workers, regardless of nationality.<\/p> <p>Qatar is the first country in the Arab Gulf region to allow all migrant workers to change jobs before the end of their contracts without first obtaining their employer\u2019s consent, one of the key aspects of the kafala (sponsorship) system that can give rise to forced labor. Qatar is the second country in the Gulf region to set a minimum wage for migrant workers, after Kuwait. The changes also apply to migrant workers who are excluded from labor law protections, such as domestic workers. However, other legal provisions that facilitate abuse and exploitation of migrant workers remain.<\/p> <p>\u201cQatar\u2019s new labor reforms are some of the most significant to date and could, if carried out effectively, considerably improve migrant workers\u2019 living and work conditions,\u201d said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWhile these changes bring Qatar a concrete step closer to meeting its reform promises, the test will be in how effectively the government carries them out and consistently applies them.\u201d<\/p> <p>Over the past 10 years, Human Rights Watch, other human rights and migrant rights organizations, United Nations experts, trade unions, and media organizations have documented how the kafala system across the region underpins migrant workers\u2019 vulnerability to a wide range of abuses, from passport confiscation to delayed wages and forced labor. These groups have revealed how key elements of the system allow migrant workers to remain trapped in employment situations where their rights to fair wages, overtime pay, adequate housing, freedom of movement, and access to justice are at risk. One such element is employer control over a migrant worker\u2019s ability to change or leave their jobs.<\/p> <p>Amendments to Qatar\u2019s 2015 law on the entry, exit, and residence of expatriates, which applies to all migrant workers, regardless of their inclusion in the labor law, removed language that had previously required them to first obtain permission, in the form of a \u201cNo Objection Certificate\u201d (NOC), from their employer in order to change jobs. This means that migrant workers can now change jobs without employer permission at any time during their employment, including during the probation period, as long as they notify their employers in accordance with Labor Ministry procedures within a prescribed notice period.<\/p> <p>The amendments require that if the employee changes jobs within the probation period, which cannot exceed six months, the new employer is required to reimburse the previous employer\u2019s recruitment costs, but only up to two months of the workers\u2019 basic wage.<\/p> <p>Qatar also amended certain provisions of the labor law to allow migrant workers to terminate their employment contracts at will, both during the probation period and after, as long as they notify their employers in writing within a prescribed notice period. If either the employer or worker terminates the contract without abiding by the notice period, they would be required to pay compensation to the other party equivalent to the worker\u2019s basic wage for the notice period or the remaining part of the notice period.<\/p> <p>Some migrant workers, including domestic workers, are not governed by the labor law, but new Labor Ministry instructions make clear that new rules for terminating employment contracts and changing jobs are consistent for all workers.<\/p> <p>Qatar introduced some earlier changes as well. In January, it extended the right to leave the country without employer permission to migrant workers not covered by the labor law. The government had previously provided this right to most migrant workers in 2018, but not to those in government, oil and gas, agriculture, or domestic workers. However, employers can still apply for exceptions for a few workers, and domestic workers are required to inform employers that they wish to leave at least 72 hours in advance.<\/p> <p>\u201cQatar has removed another key element of employer control, this time over workers\u2019 ability to leave or change jobs, but authorities should now look to remove all remaining elements that tie migrant workers\u2019 legal status to their employer,\u201d Page said.<\/p> <p>Migrant workers \u2013 and their dependents \u2013 still must rely on their employers to facilitate entry, residence, and employment in the country, meaning employers are responsible for applying for, renewing, and canceling their residency and work permits. Workers can find themselves undocumented through no fault of their own when employers fail to carry out such processes, and it is they, not their employers, who suffer the consequences.<\/p> <p>Qatar continues to impose harsh penalties for \u201cabsconding\u201d \u2013 when a migrant worker leaves their employer without permission or remains in the country beyond the grace period allowed after their residence permit expires or is revoked. The penalties include fines, detention, deportation, and a ban on re-entry.<\/p> <p>Moreover, these remaining provisions can continue to drive abuse, exploitation, and forced labor practices, particularly as workers, especially laborers and domestic workers, often depend on the employer not just for their jobs but for housing and food. In addition, passport confiscations, high recruitment fees, and deceptive recruitment practices are ongoing and largely go unpunished, and workers are banned from joining trade unions or striking.<\/p> <p>In 2017, Qatar entered a three-year technical cooperation program with the International Labour Organization (ILO), aimed at extensively reforming migrant workers\u2019 conditions, including by reforming the kafala system. Qatar committed to implementing a contractual system to replace the kafala system, including to undertake the renewal of residence permits directly with migrant workers instead of through employers.<\/p> <p>Qatar should allow migrant workers to renew their residence permits directly with the government, decriminalize the act of \u201cabsconding,\u201d and amend the labor law to guarantee migrant workers\u2019 right to strike and to form trade unions. In the meantime, and to ensure effective implementation of the introduced reforms, Qatar should introduce an amnesty that enables undocumented workers to regularize their status and relaxes their financial and legal obligations, Human Rights Watch said.<\/p> <p>Qatar also passed legislation establishing a basic minimum wage of 1,000 QAR (US$274) that would apply to all workers, regardless of nationality or sector, replacing the temporary basic minimum wage of 750 QAR ($205). Under the new legislation, if the employer does not provide food and accommodation, they are required to provide allowances of 300 QAR ($82) for the former and 500 QAR ($137) for the latter, totaling a minimum of 1,800 QAR ($494).<\/p> <p>The wage law, which will enter into force six months after its publication in the official gazette on September 8, also establishes a national minimum wage commission appointed by the Labor Ministry to review the amount at least once a year, taking into account economic factors, including economic growth, competitiveness, and productivity, as well as the needs of the workers and their families. The ministry is not obligated to appoint worker representatives to the commission, however.<\/p> <p>Migrant-Rights.org has remarked that the accommodation and food allowances are too low. Qatar should ensure that its periodic review of the minimum wage involves genuine worker representation to ensure that it is a \u201cliving wage\u201d in which workers and their families can enjoy the right to a decent standard of living, Human Rights Watch said.<\/p> <p>Qatar also introduced amendments to the labor law that set stricter penalties for employers who fail to pay their workers\u2019 wages and increase the number of labor dispute resolution committees, designed to give workers an easier and quicker way to pursue grievances against their employers. While these steps are important, they do not go far enough to tackle wage abuse. A recent Human Rights Watch report on wage abuse found that employers across Qatar frequently violate workers\u2019 right to wages and that efforts to improve the situation have largely failed.<\/p> <p>\u201cSetting a nondiscriminatory basic minimum wage will mean little for migrant workers as long as employers can withhold, delay, and deduct from their wages without consequence,\u201d Page said. \u201cThe only way to successfully tackle wage abuse is by creating effective wage protection systems and consistently penalizing those who fail to comply.\u201d<\/p> <p>The New Provisions<\/p> <p>On August 30, Qatar amended some provisions of its 2015 law on the entry, exit, and residence of expatriates to allow all migrant workers to change jobs in accordance with Labor Ministry procedures, removing language that had previously required migrant workers to first obtain permission in the form of a \u201cNo Objection Certificate\u201d (NOC) from their employer. Qatar also amended certain provisions of the labor law, setting out how migrant workers governed by the labor law can leave their jobs or change employers. These reforms came into effect immediately after the laws were published in the official gazette on September 8.<\/p> <p>The amendments also removed the need for Labor and Interior Ministry approval for job change applications, which lacked a transparent process based on clear criteria. The Labor Ministry instructions on changing jobs state that workers can now independently process their job transfer and not incur any related fees. According to the instructions, the worker is required to notify their employer of their desire to change jobs and submit required documents through the Labor Ministry\u2019s electronic notification system. Yet changing jobs is still a government-regulated process.<\/p> <p>The amendments provide that the new employer is required to reimburse the previous employer\u2019s recruitment costs, up to two months of the worker\u2019s basic wage, only when the worker changes jobs during their probation period. Houtan Homayanpour, head of the ILO Project Office for Qatar, told Migrant-Rights.org that reimbursement for job change during the probation period is a matter of concern between the two employers, not the worker. He noted that the worker is not required to provide proof of such payment, and that disputes arising from that process will not interfere with the employee\u2019s ability to change jobs.<\/p> <p>A ministerial decree issued on September 21 further amended the 2015 law on the entry, exit, and residence of expatriates to allow migrant workers 90 days from the time of expiry of their residence permits to change jobs without employer permission \u201cunless the permit has expired for reasons beyond the control of the expatriate\u201d.<\/p> <p>The labor law amendments provide that migrant workers covered by the law can now terminate their employment contracts at will, both during the probation period and after, as long as they notify their employers in writing within a prescribed notice period. The changes stipulate that a migrant worker must submit a one-month written notice if changing jobs within two years or a two-month notice if they have worked for their employer longer.<\/p> <p>If either the employer or worker terminates the contract without abiding by the notice period, they would be required to pay compensation to the other party equivalent to the worker\u2019s basic wage for the notice period or the remaining part of the notice period.<\/p> <p>If the migrant worker leaves the country without giving notice or paying the compensation required in case they failed to provide notice, Qatari authorities can ban the worker from acquiring a work permit for one year from the date of their departure.<\/p> <p>Qatar\u2019s Labor Ministry instructions on changing jobs have attempted to include a safeguard \u2013 they state that if the employer fails to fulfill their legal obligations toward the worker, the worker is not obliged to observe the notice period to change jobs. This reflects part of a legal provision in the labor law that remains in cases in which a worker on a full-time job can quit if their employer breaks their obligations under the employment contract, endangers the worker\u2019s health, assaults the worker, or misrepresents contract terms. Previously, this was the only way in which workers on fixed-term contracts could quit their jobs. The new amendments now allow workers to leave their employer or change jobs without needing to show a breach of obligations.<\/p> <p>This provision is still helpful for workers who face abuse, as it entitles them to terminate without notice and presumably, the worker would not need to pay compensation to their employer.<\/p> <p>Likewise, under the 2017 domestic workers law, domestic workers could previously terminate their contracts only if they could prove that their employer broke contractual obligations, physically harmed them, endangered their health, or misrepresented the contract terms, but under the new Labor Ministry instructions, domestic workers can also terminate their contract with or without notice, and in cases in which they face a breach of contract, they can still terminate contracts at any time, without notice, and maintain their right to end-of-service benefits. The instructions also state that an updated standard employment contract for domestic workers reflecting these rules is forthcoming.<\/p> <p>Remaining Factors that Facilitate Labor Abuses<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch research has shown that abuses against migrant worker rights in Qatar are serious and systemic and that the violations often stem from its labor governance system, the criminalization of \u201cabsconding\u201d \u2013 the routine confiscation of worker passports by employers, and the payment of recruitment fees by workers, which can keep them indebted for years. In conjunction with the prohibition on worker strikes, and the ineffective implementation and enforcement of laws designed to protect migrant workers\u2019 rights, these factors have contributed to abuse, exploitation, and even forced labor.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch spoke to over 80 migrant workers between January 2019 and February 2020 regarding their experiences working in Qatar. They were employed by diverse employers in various fields and include workers in professional occupations, as well as workers in low-paid jobs such as construction and domestic work.<\/p> <p>An overwhelming majority said they experienced one or more of a wide range of labor abuses. Migrant workers cited several barriers to seeking redress or better working conditions, including the now-lifted need for employer approval to change jobs. They also cited the excessive control individual employers have over migrant workers\u2019 legal status in the country, which allows employers to threaten and extort migrant workers to keep them working in abusive conditions and which deters workers from standing up to abusive employers for fear of retaliation.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe bought my ticket home, but he didn\u2019t pay my salary from January 2019 to October 2019,\u201d a worker said of an abusive employer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to labor court because my ID was expired and I was scared I would be put in jail. My employer told me the moment I step outside I will be jailed.\u201d<\/p> <p>Migrant Workers\u2019 Lack of Control Over Their Legal Status<\/p> <p>Most workers interviewed expressed a fear of falling into irregular migration status, which could lead to arrest, detention, and deportation.<\/p> <p>Employers are responsible for obtaining, renewing, and canceling work and residency permits for migrant workers, leaving workers dependent on them for their legal residency.<\/p> <p>Employers are required to secure or renew residence permits for their workers within 90 days of a migrant worker\u2019s arrival or of the expiration of the permit. An employer\u2019s failure to secure or renew the permit within the prescribed time leaves the worker under threat of arrest, detention, and deportation, restricting their freedom of movement and discouraging them from seeking legal assistance. An employer can also cancel a worker\u2019s residency permit at any time, which also limits the worker\u2019s ability to remain in the country legally up to 90 days.<\/p> <p>A worker who does not leave the country within the prescribed 90 days can be sentenced to a maximum of 3 years in prison or a maximum fine of 50,000 QAR, or both. They can be fined a further 200 QAR for each day they overstay their visa.<\/p> <p>\u201cI still don\u2019t have a Qatar ID or a health card,\u201d said a Ghanaian migrant worker who arrived in Qatar in September 2018 and who told Human Rights Watch in April 2019 that his company pays him late and sometimes doesn\u2019t pay him at all. \u201cIf the police arrest me, they will deport me. And the sponsor will abandon me, and I won\u2019t be given the money I am owed.\u201d<\/p> <p>One Kenyan migrant worker said that when he arrived in Qatar in October 2018, his company confiscated his passport and housed him in dismal accommodations with 10 to 12 people in 1 room. He said he works 12-hour days, rarely gets paid on time and some months not at all, and gets no days off, all of which violate Qatari law. For six months, he said, he waited for the company to issue him a residency permit, confining himself to his labor camp for fear of being arrested. \u201cAll you could do was go to work and back, no moving around, not even to the supermarket,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Migrant workers cited not having valid Qatari residence permits as a barrier to seeking justice. One migrant domestic worker from Kenya who arrived in Qatar in April 2019 said her employer had only paid her half her salary as of December:<\/p> <p>She also took my passport and she never got me a QID [Qatari identity card], she hasn\u2019t even taken me yet to get my fingerprints for the QID, so I can\u2019t leave the house to complain about her to the labor court. How can I complain when I don\u2019t even have a residency permit?<\/p> <p>One migrant worker said that his employer had intentionally refused to renew his residency permit as retaliation for seeking redress for unpaid wages:<\/p> <p>Twice I have been picked up by the police for having an expired QID \u2013 it\u2019s not my fault, the company refused to renew my ID card after we [my colleagues and I] launched a case [at the labor dispute settlements committee] against them.<\/p> <p>Workers\u2019 dependence on employers for their legal status in the country could undermine the recent reforms and hinder a migrant worker\u2019s ability to transfer to another job.<\/p> <p>Absconding<\/p> <p>While an employer can cancel their migrant worker\u2019s residence permit at any time by initiating repatriation procedures without providing justification, a worker who leaves their employer without permission can be punished with imprisonment, fines, deportation, and bans for \u201cabsconding.\u201d Employers can also be punished for not reporting to the authorities when their workers have \u201cabsconded.\u201d<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch documented three cases over the past year in which employers filed false \u201crunaway\u201d cases, also known as \u201cabsconding\u201d charges, against migrant workers in their employ after the workers submitted abuse complaints against them to the Labor Ministry, intentionally placing them at risk of arrest and deportation in retaliation.<\/p> <p>\u201cAfter all these years that I\u2019ve lived and worked in this country, I know now, if I try to stand up to my employers, I will lose,\u201d said one Indian migrant worker who lived and worked in Qatar for 13 years without incident but whose most recent employer had him deported as a runaway because he complained to the Labor Ministry about his wages being delayed for months at a time.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy boss went to the police and told them I was a runaway, even though I was at home,\u201d said a Filipino general cleaner who said she had stopped working and submitted a complaint at the Labor Ministry after her wages were not paid or delayed and that she experienced other abuses for over a year with her previous employer. \u201cShe is doing all this because I launched a case against her.\u201d While the worker has since been able to clear the charges against her, her employer evicted her and other workers who complained from their accommodations, leaving them to fend for themselves without a job while they awaited the outcome of the labor case.<\/p> <p>Threats, Extortion, and the Fear of Retaliation<\/p> <p>Several migrant workers said they had continued to work for their employers despite abusive working conditions, either because of their employer\u2019s threats or extortion or because they feared their employers would retaliate against them, including by refusing to regularize their status in the country or by filing a \u201crunaway\u201d case against them. While Qatar has introduced measures aimed at improving workers\u2019 access to justice, the right to pursue compensation is often ineffective for migrant workers whose immigration status is controlled by an employer often responsible for the abuse.<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of my sponsor, and what will happen to me if I go to complain,\u201d said a laborer from Bangladesh. He said his employer had demanded that he pay him 4,000 riyals ($1,098) to issue him a residency permit and threatened to submit a runaway case against him if he did not.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to criticize them because what we do helps our families [back home] and we don\u2019t want to lose these jobs,\u201d said a cleaner from the Philippines who said her employer made unfair deductions from her wages.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen we complain [about our working conditions], they threaten to cancel our permits and send us home,\u201d said a security guard from Kenya who said he had experienced passport confiscation, unpaid and delayed wages, and dismal housing conditions. \u201cI cannot fight a big company like this.\u201d<\/p> <p>One Indian migrant worker who had worked as a personal driver since he arrived in Qatar in 2016 said in October 2019 that his employer exploited the control he had over his legal status in the country by subjecting him to both threats and extortion:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3S829FDFT4GYRYUCX40N9CW9OGDXDI"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":499,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other

slept for two weeks, Luis Osorto decided his only chance for eventual asylum in the United States was to stay put along the border just inside Mexico.<\/p> <p>Central American migrants are seen in an encampment in Matamoros, Mexico, at the end of the Gateway International Bridge, where migrants sent back under the \"Remain in Mexico\" program, officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), await their U.S. asylum hearings, September 14, 2019. Picture taken September 14, 2019. REUTERS\/Henry Romero<\/p> <p>But the 37-year-old Honduran made a pact with himself: not to leave the enclave of tents at the end of a bridge between Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas - not even to buy a bottle of water or to collect money transfers from his family back home.<\/p> <p>The cramped camp, in a partly fenced-in plaza abutting administrative buildings just feet from the Rio Grande, is home to approximately 1,000 migrants, many of them sent back to Mexico to await U.S. immigration hearings under a policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) begun this year.<\/p> <p>After what is commonly known as an \u201cexpress kidnapping\u201d last month by men waiting in a van for him outside a convenience store where he was collecting a $100 transfer from relatives, Osorto promised himself he would only leave the camp to cross the bridge to Texas for his December court date with U.S. immigration authorities.<\/p> <p>\u201cI just wait here and trust someone else ... to get me 70 pesos ($3.50) or so when I need it,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>MPP, sometimes called Remain in Mexico, is among various overlapping U.S. policies aimed at severely reducing asylum claims.<\/p> <p>President Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on immigration was a mainstay of his 2016 campaign, has said lax U.S. asylum laws encourage people to show up at the border with their children.<\/p> <p>Before MPP, it was common practice to release arriving families into the United States to wait out their U.S. court hearings \u2013 something Trump and others said allowed many migrants to disappear into the country to live illegally. Studies by legal aid groups, such as the Urban Justice Center, have shown that most asylum seekers show up for their hearings, however.<\/p> <p>More than 51,000 people, mainly from Central America, have been sent to Mexico since the MPP program started in January, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.<\/p> <p>But reports of kidnapping and extortion have increased since the program was expanded to Matamoros and nearby Nuevo Laredo in crime-wracked Tamaulipas state.<\/p> <p>Human Rights First, a U.S.-based rights group, in August documented 110 publicly reported cases of rape, kidnapping, sexual exploitation and other violence against MPP returnees.<\/p> <p>In Matamoros, violence and abuse targeting migrants means many in the MPP program refuse to move to a shelter in the city during their long waits for a U.S. court hearing.<\/p> <p>Since July, Matamoros has received more than 12,000 asylum seekers under MPP, said Enrique Maciel, of the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants, a state agency.<\/p> <p>Slideshow ( 7 images )<\/p> <p>Matamoros Mayor Mario Lopez described the city as calmer than neighboring towns, because of a truce between two rival drug cartels. Elsewhere in the state, gangs regularly fight pitched battles for turf.<\/p> <p>Reuters spoke to six asylum seekers at Osorto\u2019s camp who said they had been kidnapped or extorted, and several more who had brushes with suspected criminals near the border or elsewhere within Mexico.<\/p> <p>Oscar Ramirez, a 30-year-old Honduran waiting for a U.S. court date on Dec. 2, said three Mexican men surrounded him around midnight last month, and began interrogating him on his plans and his paperwork, he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cI was terrified,\u201d said Ramirez, who said he ran away from the men when a crowd of people arrived. \u201cThe rumors circulating are that at any moment unknown people will kidnap you.\u201d<\/p> <p>Reuters was unable to independently corroborate the migrants\u2019 stories. Osorto said he did not report the attack on him to police.<\/p> <p>Kristin Clarens, a U.S. attorney who advises asylum-seekers at the border, said she had come across five cases of migrants in Matamoros awaiting MPP hearings who were kidnapped briefly. They were taken to an ATM to clear out their accounts or forced to phone relatives to send cash transfers to a nearby convenience store.<\/p> <p>A spokesman for Mexico\u2019s National Institute for Migration said it had no data on such complaints.

The McMichaels and Bryan will face a hate crime trial in federal court on Feb. 7, when jury selection begins. The Department of Justice filed the charges last February, saying the McMichaels, who are white, targeted Arbery, a Black man, \u201cbecause of his race and color.\u201d<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>They face possible life sentences. The McMichaels already received life sentences without the possibility of parole for the murder, while Bryan was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis case is a litmus test as to where our judicial system is,\u201d Lee Merritt, the attorney for Arbery\u2019s family, told HuffPost. \u201cWe will have a chance to see the grisly facts and images the nation has become intimately familiar with, reconciled with the hate and ideology that motivated those actions.\u201d<\/p> <p>The trial will be a stark difference from the state trial, where prosecutors hinted at a racial motive but never presented evidence to that effect \u2014 even though some was available, including the alleged use of racial slurs during the murder. While Glynn County prosecutors stuck strictly to the mechanical facts of whether the three men unjustly took a life, federal prosecutors will seek a more profound judgment: one that says crimes motivated by prejudice should be considered a crime against the whole country.<\/p> <p>Arbery\u2019s death \u2014 and the subsequent long delay before charges were filed \u2014 did spark a wide conversation about how cheap Black life can be in America. \u201cThere is something so simple and tragic about a young man not even being able to run and jog in public in America,\u201d Brian Levin, a hate crime expert and attorney, said. \u201cIt is not only the tragedy and the loss of Arbery, it was mounting to the beginnings of a lynch mob.\u201d<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>A Different Legal Standard<\/p> <p>In Glynn County, the prosecution focused heavily on the legal standard of murder and Travis McMichael\u2019s claim that he was simply executing a citizen\u2019s arrest.<\/p> <p>Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, at times, made arguments that contained a slight \u2014 but never explicit \u2014 nod to racial animus on the part of the McMichaels and Bryan.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are here because of assumptions and driveway decisions. All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions. Not on facts, not on evidence. On assumptions,\u201d she said during opening statements.<\/p> <p>But the prosecution never introduced evidence, for example, that Bryan told law enforcement officials that Travis McMichael shouted out a racial slur toward Arbery after gunning him down, uttering, \u201cf***ing n****r\u201d after the shooting over Arbery\u2019s body. Defense lawyers asked prosecutors not to ask about it in court because Bryan was the only witness of the alleged incident.<\/p> <p>The judge presiding over the case heard arguments from lawyers on Friday about racist text messages and whether they should be admitted as evidence. The content of the messages is not clear, but Bryan\u2019s lawyer concedes they are \u201chighly inflammatory.\u201d He argued that disclosing the texts in court would unfairly sway Black jurors.<\/p> <p>Demonstrators march near the Glynn County Courthouse after the adjournment of daily court proceedings in the trial for the killers of Ahmaud Arbery on Nov. 18, 2021, in Brunswick, Georgia. Sean Rayford via Getty Images<\/p> <p>In May 2020, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requested a federal probe from the U.S. Department of Justice into Arbery\u2019s death.<\/p> <p>In the federal indictment, the McMichaels and Bryan are all charged with attempting to \u201cforcibly hold and detain Arbery against his will,\u201d which resulted in the young Black man\u2019s death. The three, also charged with kidnapping, are alleged to have restricted Arbery of his \u201cfree movement\u201d and \u201ccorral and detain him against his will, and prevent his escape.\u201d<\/p> <p>The hate crime charges focus on the motivations of the three men when they were chasing Arbery in broad daylight.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>The day Arbery was murdered was not the first time he was being chased, Merritt said. It was a reoccurring \u201chunt\u201d that resulted in the death of a young Black man. This was evident in the murder trial, as the McMichaels made 911 calls about a Black male walking in and out of a construction site months before Arbery was murdered.<\/p> <p>The legal system in Georgia will also face scrutiny. Merritt said the jury on the federal trial will hear \u201crevealing things\u201d about what Waycross Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill \u201cfelt about Black people.\u201d Barnhill recused himself from Arbery\u2019s case, but not before he wrote a letter to Glynn County police arguing that the three men shouldn\u2019t be arrested. He argued that the McMichaels were lawfully following a burglary suspect \u201cwith solid first hand probable cause.\u201d<\/p> <p>Barnhill was the second prosecutor to touch the case of Arbery\u2019s murder after former Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson recused herself from the case because she knew Gregory McMichael.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe already had the criminality of their actions adjudicated before the court of law. The federal charges are going after the terroristic aspect of their actions and the implications they had for Black people of this country,\u201d Merritt said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat is on trial now is not their behavior, but their reasoning for the behavior. This is an issue that has not been taken up yet, it is an issue of first impression.\u201d<\/p> <p>Shifting Laws Around Hate Crimes<\/p> <p>Before Arbery\u2019s murder, Georgia was one of four states without hate crime laws on the books. But that eventually changed.<\/p> <p>Georgia enacted a hate crime statute in June 2020, months after Arbery\u2019s death, and later repealed its citizen\u2019s arrest statute. The legislation imposes penalties for crimes that are motivated by a person\u2019s race, religion, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender or disability \u2014 but the McMichaels and Bryan could not be charged under it, since the law was not in place at the time of Arbery\u2019s murder.<\/p> <p>Forty-seven states now have hate crime statutes on the books. But bias motivations in hate crime statutes vary statewide. South Carolina, Wyoming and Arkansas are the only remaining states without hate crime laws.<\/p> <p>There are five federal hate crime statutes that federal prosecutors use when determining if a person should be charged with a hate crime.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is a bigger picture here, which is the history of this country with Black people being killed for racist motives.\u201d - Heidi Beirich, chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism<\/p> <p>The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which was introduced under the administration of former President Barack Obama, makes it a crime for someone to be injured or assaulted with a dangerous weapon due to their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected categories.<\/p> <p>The case of James Byrd Jr. dates back to 1998. Like Arbery, Byrd had been murdered by three white men.<\/p> <p>Byrd accepted a ride from Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer and John King, all of whom were white supremacists, in Jasper, Texas. Instead of taking Byrd home during the ride, they severely beat him and chained him by his ankles, dragging him with a pickup truck.<\/p> <p>After Byrd\u2019s lynching, Texas enacted its own hate crime law.<\/p> <p>Experts view the murder of Byrd and the enactment of the act as a pivotal moment in American history and also something that was long overdue.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cI think it is noteworthy under the Shepard Byrd act, which were two other cases that captured the soul of good America at a time when we are looking at increases of racial violence,\u201d Levin said.<\/p> <p>Arbery\u2019s family rejected a plea deal in the federal hate crime charges on Jan. 7, even after the men were convicted of murder in Glynn County.<\/p> <p>His mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the media that the three men need to stand trial again for their brutal actions.<\/p> <p>A Climate Of Hate<\/p> <p>Hate crimes against Black people jumped nearly 40% from 2019 to 2020. And 2020, the year Arbery was murdered, saw the most hate crimes in the country since 2001, according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.<\/p> <p>The year Arbery was killed, protests across the country followed the murder of George Floyd by a police officer as well as the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville.<\/p> <p>During this time, 61% of hate crimes showed people were targeted because of their race, ethnicity or ancestry, according to statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. White people comprised 55% of the perpetrators who committed hateful acts.<\/p> <p>From 2010 to 2019, hate crime numbers recorded by law enforcement increased by 10%. From 2015 to 2019, nearly half of hate crimes were motivated by anti-Black or anti-African American bias.<\/p> <p>The Department of Justice says Attorney General Merrick Garland has made confronting hate crimes a \u201ctop priority\u201d and said it is rooted in the department\u2019s \u201cfoundational history\u201d of combating racial violence and protecting civil rights, according to department spokesperson Areyele Bradford.<\/p> <p>\u201cHate crimes impact not only specifically targeted victims, but they also instill fear across communities at large \u2014 regardless of whether they gain broader attention nationally,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cConsequently, the prosecution of hate crimes vindicates the rights of not only specifically targeted victims, but of larger communities as well.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hate crime experts who have studied America\u2019s racist and alt-right-adjacent groups over decades believe the trial will be critical.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3GL25Y684591VS0PAXZQS2J3XX7XM8"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":681,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"1998.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jasper","region":"None","country":"Texas","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahmaud Arbery","victim_keywords":"murder, hate crime, Georgia, racism","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"George Floyd","victim_keywords":"killed by police, protests","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Breonna Taylor","victim_keywords":"killed by police, Louisville","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Byrd Jr","victim_keywords":"hate crime, racism, 1998, Texas, lynching, dragging death","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["killing","torture"],"year":"1998.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jasper","region":"None","country":"Texas","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahmaud Arbery","victim_keywords":"murder, hate crime, Georgia, racism","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"George Floyd","victim_keywords":"killed by police, protests","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Breonna Taylor","victim_keywords":"killed by police, Louisville","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Byrd Jr","victim_keywords":"hate crime, racism, 1998, Texas, lynching, dragging death","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":946963132,"Input.title":"How to Answer Iraq\u2019s Dangerous Failure to Put a Stop to Torture","Input.publish_date":"2020-09-16 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Click to expand Image Juveniles\u2019 cell at Tal Kayf prison, taken in April 2019 and shared confidentially with Human Rights Watch, shows extreme overcrowding at the prison.  2019 Private<\/p> <p>My heart sank as my colleague told me recently about the latest torture victim from Iraq who had contacted us to share his story. I had heard the same kinds of accounts from other victims of torture in detention, including the same names of two lieutenants and a major who he said had supervised and participated in torturing him and others.<\/p> <p>I had sent those same names to Faik Zaidan, the head of the Iraqi High Judicial Council in April 2019, after earlier victims shared them with me, asking the council to investigate their actions. In fact, at Human Rights Watch, we have reported on torture in Iraq for decades, but it continues. It is clearly futile to keep calling on the Iraqi government to address the systemic use of torture and inhuman prison conditions on its own. Outside help is needed. Iraq\u2019s Parliament should ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. This would allow an independent United Nations team to visit prisons in Iraq and advise and assist Iraq in strengthening protections against torture. And short of parliamentary action, the new prime minister can act to uphold the dignity of his fellow citizens and reverse the country\u2019s shameful record on torture in detention.<\/p> <p>The young man who contacted us recently, now 22, told my colleague that as a boy of 17, he smuggled himself out of the city of Mosul in early 2015 after the Islamic State (ISIS) took control. He made his way to Iran for surgery he had needed for years. He returned to Mosul in May 2017, after Iraqi forces, with U.S. military support, retook the city.<\/p> <p>But Iraqi soldiers arrested him in April 2018 without a warrant, he said, put guns to his head, and ordered him to confess that he had been an ISIS member. When he refused, they beat him with a leather truncheon, shocked him with electricity, and hung him repeatedly from his hands bound behind his back and suspended from the ceiling on and off for five days. When he did not give in, they threatened to rape his mother and sister in front of him, he said.<\/p> <p>On the fifth day, they brought him a piece of paper, saying he needed to sign it, while blindfolded, so they could transfer him to the hospital. \u201cI later found out they had tricked me into signing a statement that I had joined ISIS for 20 days,\u201d he said. At the hospital, the officers forced the doctor to sign a document that he had not been tortured, though he says he had visible bruising, including on his face. They took him before an investigative judge, who ignored his bruises and told him a \u201csecret informant\u201d had accused him of manning an ISIS checkpoint on a Mosul road in 2015. He showed the judge the Iranian stamp in his passport -- proof he hadn\u2019t been in Mosul at the time.<\/p> <p>Ten weeks after his arrest, police transferred him to the Intelligence and Counter Terrorism Office and prison compound in Faisaliya, in east Mosul, infamous as a torture site. He said he was held there for a year in a cell with at least 250 other men and boys. There was only one toilet, and he was only able to shower once every two months. He wasn\u2019t allowed to contact his family. During that time, they hung him from the ceiling several more times, he said.<\/p> <p>In mid-2018, officers transferred him to a damaged home being used as a detention center in the town of Qayyarah, 60 kilometers south of Mosul, for five days, to a cell with at least 50 other men and boys. He said that every day the guards would bring the detainees rice and soup, dump both on the floor, and make them eat off the floor. Once, he said, guards took the detainees out in the rain and forced them to crawl on the ground in the mud.<\/p> <p>In December 2018, he said, officers transferred him to Tal Kayf prison, 10 kilometers north of Mosul, to a cell holding around 250 men and boys: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough room for all of us in the cell to lie down at the same time, so we had to take turns sleeping.\u201d He said prison guards watched as two former security officers being held on criminal charges regularly beat other detainees.<\/p> <p>In June 2019, he said, the authorities transferred the adults out of Tal Kayf prison, leaving only the detainees who, like him, were children at the time of their alleged crimes. He said this reduced the crowding but that SWAT forces -- Special Weapons and Tactics, under the Interior Ministry\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Service -- came to his cell at least six times and beat him and his cellmates.<\/p> <p>The Nineveh juvenile court in August 2019 convicted him and sentenced him to six years for ISIS affiliation. On Feb. 3, 2020, the federal appeals court acquitted and released him because of the evidence that he presented -- the Iranian passport stamp and medical records of his eye surgery. We reviewed the court records and spoke to a court employee who confirmed his account to us.<\/p> <p>The Iraqi Parliament has been unwilling to pass an anti-torture bill for years, even though Iraq\u2019s constitution prohibits torture. The bill would require a judge to order a medical examination of any detainee alleging torture within 24 hours of learning of the allegation, which is often not occurring. But maybe the parliament is more willing to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture that brings with it outside expertise and support to tackle this widespread wrong. But that should not prevent the government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi from taking action.<\/p> <p>The many governments that have been supporting Iraq for years in its fight against ISIS, including the US, UK and France, should bring funding and expertise to Baghdad to engage actively in helping the government at this critical juncture to set up a national unit to prevent torture -- a key pillar of the torture treaty\u2019s optional protocol. The unit should have the authority to inspect all detention centers in Iraq, and to create an effective system to bring complaints about mistreatment in Iraqi detention. The day the government does this, I will have a wealth of information to share.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3D5G8J4N5CJD4YLEJFZKQVHABUBVTK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"2303b84d-0115-4284-b9df-e5c53f359001","work_time_in_seconds":827,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2018","month":"04","date":null,"city":"Mosul","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"young man, beat, shocked, hung by hands, threatened, tricked into signing confession, imprisoned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other","torture"],"year":"2018","month":"04","date":null,"city":"Mosul","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"young man, beat, shocked, hung by hands, threatened, tricked into signing confession, imprisoned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1001797753,"Input.title":"Inside Myanmar\u2019s Daily Junta Reality","Input.publish_date":"2021-08-31 05:17:47","Input.article_interface":"<p>Myanmar\u2019s military leaders used its armed forces to launch its coup and take control of the country from its elected government on February 1, 2021. In protest, millions of people took to the streets. The military responded to these protests by sending armed soldiers and police into residential areas to arrest defiant civilians, workers, students, doctors and nurses.<\/p> <p>In March, martial law was enforce in Yangon, snipers were used, and protestors were shot on sight.<\/p> <p>To restrict news coverage of their crimes and to impede the organisatiojn of protests, the military ordered telecommunication companies to restrict internet and mobile phone coverage. Independent media outlets had their licenses withdrawn, offices were raided and thrashed. Journalists were targeted and hunted by soldiers and police. Obscure laws were added to the penal code and used to restrict freedom of speech and expression. State-controlled media published pages of arrest warrants and photographs of the wanted, including journalists.<\/p> <p>To avoid arrest, independent journalists went underground or sought refuge with border based ethnic armed organizations.<\/p> <p>Myanmar journalists are well aware that being \u2018arrested\u2019 and held in detention by the military doesn\u2019t come with respect for their legal or human rights.

When we had to run and go into hiding, we lost our home and our possessions. You lose your income. Your equipment. You never feel safe when hiding. Living like this affects all of us. If the military does not find me, they will pressure and threaten my family with arrest.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet said he is still working despite the risk of arrest.\u201cLosing a journalist is a big loss for our struggle for democracy. We\u2019re only doing our job as reporters, but our news coverage exposes the military and its abuses \u2013 this is why we\u2019re the enemy.\u201d<\/p> <p>Despite the danger to him and his family, Nyan Linn Htet worries about the safety of those who helped him avoid arrest. \u201cIf I\u2019m caught in hiding, the SAC (military-appointed State Administration Council) will persecute the people who gave me a place to live. I\u2019m afraid they [the military] will arrest those who helped me.\u201d<\/p> <p>His fears are well founded.<\/p> <p>Journalist and political analyst Sithu Aung Myint was high on the military\u2019s wanted list for his political commentary and published opposition to the coup. On Sunday August 15, the military raided the home of his colleague, BBC freelance producer, Htet Htet Khine, and arrested both of them. A week later, in its Sunday August 21 edition, the military-run newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said Sithu Aung Myint had been charged with sedition, spreading \u2018fake news\u2019 and being critical of the military coup leaders and its State Administration Council under Sections 505 (a) and 124 (a) of the Penal Code. He could be sentenced to life in jail under Section 124 (a) of the penal code. Htet Htet Khine was arrested for giving shelter to Sithu Aung Myint, and charged under section 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act for working with the recently formed National Union Government\u2019s radio station, Federal FM.<\/p> <p>Friends and colleagues of Sithu Aung Myint and Htet Htet Khine told IFJ they are concerned both journalists were held at an interrogation centre for over a week before having access to either legal help or contact with colleagues or family.<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet told IFJ he is aware his legal and human rights will not be respected if he is arrested. \u201cThey will not let us get legal help until they\u2019ve got what they want from us. The military amended 505 (a) of the Penal Code to prevent giving us bail. We know they will jail us even if we have legal representation. We know SAC is torturing journalists because of the work we do.\u201d<\/p> <p>Reports by local and international humanitarian groups have detailed the severe beatings \u2013 hours of maintaining stressed positions, use of sexual violence \u2013 and killing of people while held in detention.<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htet said if arrested, he knows it will come with beatings. He admits that the thought of being tortured keeps him awake at night. \u201cThey will jail me, but only after they torture me. I will not be released until I sign a statement that I will never criticize them. I\u2019m not afraid of being arrested, but torture scares me. There are nights when I\u2019m too afraid to sleep.\u201d<\/p> <p>He and other local journalists told the IFJ it was disappointing that international media has dropped Myanmar from its news agenda and moved on to cover other stories.<\/p> <p>Nyan Linn Htets said despite access difficulties, the international media can use local reporters who are willing to help. \u201cWe know the difficulties media has getting ground access to Myanmar. Covid-19 restrictions also make it impossible to legally cross borders from neighboring countries, but we are already here in the country and are capable of doing the job.\u201d<\/p> <p>Despite the fear of arrest and torture, he is still reporting and urged local journalists to keep doing the same. \u201cIt\u2019s important we use what we can to still work and report news events of interest to people. People are accessing news and information in many different ways now.\u201d<\/p> <p>The military, while thrashing local and international laws and ignoring its constitution, is quick to use and amend laws to jail its opponents for being critical of the coup and for reporting military violence, abuse and corruption.<\/p> <p>We have no rights<\/p> <p>Nan Paw Gay, editor-in-chief at Karen Information Center, said the military council has no respect for journalists or their right to publish information in the public interest.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is no freedom of the press. If journalist\u2019s try to report news or seek information from the military\u2019s opponents \u2013 CRPH, NUG, CDM, G-Z and PDF \u2013 the State Administration Council prosecutes them under Section 17\/1 of the Illegal Association Act. Since the military launched its coup, sources we use have had their freedom of speech and expression made illegal and they now risk arrest for talking to us and\u2026 we can be arrested for speaking with them. Independent media groups have been outlawed and totally lost their right to speak freely or write about news events.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nan Paw Gay points out if journalists are \u201ccritical of the military, its appointed State Administration Council or its lack of a public health plan to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic now ravaging the country, section 505 (a) is used to arrest journalists for spreading false news.\u201d Essentially torture is used to terrorise journalists, she said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen the military council arrests and detains journalists, the torture is both physical and psychological. Even before being detained threats are issued and then during the arrest the violence becomes real \u2013 shootings, people being kicked and dragged from homes by their hair and beaten.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nan Paw Gay says women journalists are more likely to be \u201ctortured using psychological abuse \u2013 kept in a dark room and constantly told that they will be killed tomorrow \u2013 to mess and generate fear with their thoughts. You can see the effects of the tortured on some journalists when they appear in court \u2013 shaking hands and body spasms.\u201d<\/p> <p>Military brutality is a daily reality for Myanmar\u2019s people. At the time of writing, the army is preparing to deploy and reinforce its bases with hundreds of extra troops into areas of the Karen National Union-controlled territory and where anti-coup protestors, striking doctors and politicians have been offered refuge and safety. A senior ethnic Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) soldier told the IFJ that army drones and helicopters have been surveying the area in recent months.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe know they\u2019ve sent munitions and large troop numbers to our area\u2026 last time we had drones flying over our area, they later attacked villages and our positions with airstrikes. They\u2019re already fighting in our Brigade 5 and 1 and have started in 6 and 2.\u201d<\/p> <p>Since the military launched its coup on February 1, there has been at least 500 armed battles between the KNU and the military regime and 70,000 Karen civilians have been displaced and are hiding in makeshift camps as a direct result of these attacks. Fighter jets have flown into Karen National Union-controlled areas 27 times and dropped at least 47 bombs, killing 14 civilians and wounding 28.<\/p> <p>Naw K\u2019nyaw Paw, general secretary of the Karen Women Organization, in an interview with Karen News, said villagers displaced by the Myanmar Army attacks are now in desperate need of humanitarian aid.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey shoot at villagers if they see them on their farms, burning down their rice barns and killing the livestock left behind. The Burma Army also arrests people when they see them and use them as human shields to protect them when attacked by Karen soldiers.\u201d<\/p> <p>Naw K\u2019nyaw Paw said accessing the displaced villagers is difficult, especially during the wet season.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe only accessible way in is on foot, supplies have to be carried through jungle. Given the restrictions due to Covid-19 as well as the increasing Burma Army military operations, villagers are unable to return to their homes and they will need food, clothing and medicine, especially the young and old.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nan Paw Gay says the military\u2019s strategy to muzzle the media is a familiar tactic that has been used before. \u201cStop international media getting access to conflict areas, shut down independent media, hunt local journalists and when there\u2019s no one to left to report, launch attacks in ethnic regions, displacing thousands of villagers.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013<\/p> <p>*Phil Thornton is a journalist and senior adviser to the International Federation of Journalists in South East Asia.

Today, the focus shifted to the protagonist himself and the nature of the US-UK Extradition Treaty of 2003, a contentious document that shines all too favourably for US citizens.<\/p> <p>Julian Assange, whose deteriorating condition has been noted for months by psychologists, doctors and UN Special Rapporteur on torture Nils Melzer, has been making a fist of it in the dock, despite being in Kafkaesque isolation. Exhaustion, however, is manifest. Judge Vanessa Baraitser has been keeping an eye on Assange\u2019s demeanour, prodding his lawyers at one point to inspect him. His eyes had closed, his attention seemingly wavering. A point of permanent frustration for the WikiLeaks founder has been the din the hearings are causing and the distance, physical and symbolic, from his legal team. \u201cI am as much a participant in these proceedings I am at Wimbledon.\u201d<\/p> <p>The structural impediments he has had to face have been profound, a point he was keen to make to the bench. \u201cI cannot meaningfully communicate with my lawyers. There are unnamed embassy officials in this court room. I cannot communicate with my lawyers to ask them for clarifications without the other side seeing.\u201d<\/p> <p>The singular nature of Assange\u2019s case has not struck the judge as sufficient grounds to accept special measures. The defence team insists, not unreasonably, that legal advice given to him be kept privileged. This is a particularly sore point, given the surveillance efforts conducted by UC Global SC in Assange\u2019s place of abode for some seven years, London\u2019s Ecuadorean embassy. This involved audio and film footage on lawyers visiting and discussing case matters with Assange relayed to servers accessible to the Central Intelligence Agency. \u201cThere has been enough spying on my lawyers already. The other side has about 100 times more contact with their lawyers per day. What is the point of asking if I can concentrate if I cannot participate?\u201d<\/p> <p>To these points the judge remained dismissive, annoyed at his intervention in the absence of testifying. \u201cI can\u2019t make an exception in your case.\u201d A brief recess did follow, permitting Assange to leave the dock for a backroom consultation with his legal team. True to form in this entire charade, security officers were in their company.<\/p> <p>The defence team then attempted to convince the bench to adjust future seating arrangements which would permit Assange to sit with them. This led to a technical lunacy: Did the request, pondered the judge, constitute a bail application in which Assange would technically be out of the court\u2019s custody? The legal team representing the United States did not object, as security officers would be present on either side of him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s so technical as that,\u201d came the assessment from James Lewis QC. The judge, torn by convention and legal minutiae, was tart in response. \u201cI\u2019m not you\u2019re right Mr Lewis.\u201d An application will be heard to that effect on Thursday, though Lewis did make it clear that any bail application would be opposed.<\/p> <p>As for the extradition treaty itself, Article 4 stipulates that, \u201cExtradition shall not be granted if the offense for which the extradition is requested is a political offense.\u201d The team representing the US government suggested that the judge have recourse to substantive UK domestic law, not the Treaty itself. Whether Assange was wanted for political reasons or not was irrelevant as he was \u201cnot entitled to derive any rights from the [US-UK Extradition] Treaty\u201d.<\/p> <p>The prosecution effectively relied on a peculiarity of the Westminster system: the Treaty, ratified in 2007, had not been incorporated into UK domestic law. That domestic law can be found in the Extradition Act 2003, which does not feature political offenses as a bar to extradition. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a political offense in ordinary English law\u201d, something that only arose in the context of extradition.<\/p> <p>Assange\u2019s team took issue with the contention: the Extradition Treaty as ratified in the US in 2007, in not removing the political offense provision, was intended to have legal effect. \u201cIt is an essential protection,\u201d argued Edward Fitzgerald QC, \u201cwhich the US puts in every single one of its extradition treaties.\u201d It followed that, \u201cBoth governments must therefore have regarded Article 4 as a protection for the liberty of the individual whose necessity continues (at least in relations between the USA and the UK).\u201d While the 2003 Extradition Act did not include a political offence bar, \u201cauthority establishes that it is the duty of the court, not the executive, to ensure the legality of extradition under the terms of the Treaty.\u201d This placed an onus on the judge, submitted Fitzgerald, to follow a practice set by over a century of extradition treaties which consider the political offence exemption.<\/p> <p>Resort should also be had to the Magna Carta and Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the \u201cright to liberty and security\u201d provision) to reach a conclusion that extraditing an individual for a political offence would constitute an abuse of process.<\/p> <p>The defence also turned to the issue of espionage itself, arguing that there was little doubt that it was political in nature, or, as Fitzgerald contended, \u201ca pure political offence\u201d within the meaning of the US-UK Extradition Treaty and relevant case law. The conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, the 18th charge being levelled at Assange, also suggested that it be treated as an espionage offence. In fact, the entire case and effort against Assange had been political from the start, with US politicians, commentators and members of the media branding him \u201chostile\u201d and \u201ctreasonous\u201d despite not being a US citizen.<\/p> <p>Fitzgerald also furthered the legal principle \u2013 \u201cvirtually universal\u201d, he contended \u2013 that non-violent individuals should not be extradited for political offences. \u201cIf it is not a terrorist case, a violence offence, you should not be extradited for a political offence.\u201d More in keeping with the work of non-governmental organisations, extraditing Assange would embolden other powers to consider this pathway to seek those responsible for \u201cdisclosures that are uncomfortable or threatening.\u201d Governments of all political hues will be taking heed from this.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>The Glass Cage and Heaven in a Rage<\/p> <p>Thursday, February 27, Woolwich Crown Court. The first round of extradition hearings regarding Julian Assange\u2019s case concluded a day early, to recommence on May 18th. It ended on an insensible note very much in keeping with the woolly-headed reasoning of Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who is of the view that a WikiLeaks publisher in a cage does not put all heaven in a rage. On Wednesday, Assange\u2019s defence had requested whether he would be able to leave the confines of his glass cage and join his legal team. As Assange had explained in response to his nodding off during proceedings, \u201cI cannot meaningfully communicate with my lawyers.\u201d There was little point in \u201casking\u201d if he could follow proceedings without enabling his participation.<\/p> <p>This was not a point that fell on reasonable ears. The judge felt it came too close to a bail application, and was initially refused as posing a potential risk to the public. Gibberish was duly thrown at counsel for both sides, with \u201chealth and safety\u201d, \u201crisk assessment\u201d and \u201cup to Group 4\u201d featuring as meaningless terms on the obvious: that Assange could pose no threat whatsoever, as he would be in the continuous company of security guards. As former UK diplomat Craig Murray observed, \u201cShe started to resemble something worse than a Dalek, a particularly stupid local government officer of a very low grade.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to the judge, to permit such a measure of access between Assange and his team effectively constituted a departure from court custody, a striking nonsense of Dickensian dimensions. Not even the prosecution felt it unreasonable, suggesting that one need not be so \u201ctechnical\u201d in granting such applications.<\/p> <p>Thursday\u2019s proceedings reaffirmed Judge Baraitser\u2019s stubborn position. Her first gesture was to permit Assange a pair of headphones to better enable him to hear the proceedings, followed by a brief adjournment to see if his hearing had, in fact, improved. Assange was unimpressed, removing them after 30 minutes.<\/p> <p>Her stretched reasoning found Assange sufficiently accessible to his lawyers despite his glassed surrounds; he could still communicate with them via notes passed through the barrier. \u201cIt is quite apparent over the past four days that you have had no difficulty communicating with your legal team.\u201d The judge was willing to permit Assange a later start in proceedings to enable a meeting with the legal team and adjourn should the defence wish to meet their client in a holding cell.<\/p> <p>That so complex a case as extradition can be reduced to sporadic notes passed to legal counsel and staggered adjournments suggests the continued hobbling of the defence by the authorities. Its invidiousness lies in how seemingly oblivious the judicial mind is to the scope of the case, complexity reduced to a matter of meetings, small points of procedure and law.<\/p> <p>The defence team submitted that the process of consultation suggested by the judge unduly prolonged proceedings, rendering them cumbersome and insensible. The court might have to adjourn ever three minutes for a 20-minute break. To constantly take Assange to and from his holding cell was would unnecessarily lengthen proceedings and complicate matters. Judge Baraitser was dismissive of such argument, claiming that the defence was merely exaggerating.<\/p> <p>The legal issues discussed on the fourth day centred on quibbling over the issue of espionage and its nexus with political activity. Espionage, suggested James Lewis QC for the US-driven prosecution, need not be political. Nor did it seem that Assange was intent on bringing down the US government. \u201cIt can\u2019t possibly be said that there is a political struggle in existence between the American government and opposing factions.\u201d<\/p> <p>Lewis, as has been his approach from the start, preferred a more restrictive interpretation about what a \u201cpolitical\u201d offence might be, notably in connection with extradition. \u201cExtradition is based on conduct, it is not anymore based on the names of offences.\u201d In a rather crude, end-of-history line of thought, Lewis argued that political offences were \u201cdated\u201d matters, hardly applicable to modern societies which no longer see dissidents upholding the values of liberal democracy. (It seems that the tree of liberty, according to the US prosecution, no longer needs urgent refreshment.)<\/p> <p>Besides, argued Lewis, the court did \u201cnot need to resolve these issues, but they demonstrate that any bare assertion that Wikileaks was engaged in a struggle with the US government was in opposition to it or was seeking to bring about a policy change would need to be examined far more closely.\u201d<\/p> <p>That is exactly what the defence contended. Assange\u2019s core activities in publishing had been based on altering US policy, with Iraq and Afghanistan being key theatres. \u201cWhy was he seeking to publish the rules of engagement?\u201d, posed the defence. \u201cThey were published to show that war crimes were being committed, to show they breached their own rules of engagement.\u201d Ditto the publication of the Guantanamo files, an act done to reveal the extent of torture being undertaken during the course of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d. All these, contended Edward Fitzgerald QC for the defence, did change government policy. \u201cWikiLeaks didn\u2019t just seek to induce change, it did induce change.\u201d<\/p> <p>The documentary record on Assange\u2019s political activity in this regard is thick, much of it from the contentions of US officials themselves. The US State Department preferred to see him, as former spokesman PJ Crowley did in 2010, a \u201cpolitical actor\u201d with \u201ca political agenda\u201d, rather than being a journalist.<\/p> <p>Incidentally, Crowley\u2019s link with WikiLeaks has a curious end, with his resignation in 2011 following comments made about the treatment of Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning at the Quantico marine base in Virginia. \u201cWhat is being done to Bradley Manning,\u201d he claimed at an MIT seminar that March, \u201cis ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid on the part of the department of defence.\u201d Not an entirely bad egg, then.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3H781YYV6VXW2NZSOPAAQRTOBW1TEZ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":1219,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020","month":"February","date":"26","city":"London","region":"unknown","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"Woolwich Crown Court, Assange, WikiLeaks, United Kingdom, United States, CIA, extradition, court, human rights","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020","month":"February","date":"26","city":"London","region":"unknown","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"Woolwich Crown Court, Assange, WikiLeaks, United Kingdom, United States, CIA, extradition, court, human rights","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":890500472,"Input.title":"Dua Mangi's abduction releases social media vitriol against her","Input.publish_date":"2019-12-03 07:44:14","Input.article_interface":"<p>Dua Mangi - a young girl, got kidnapped & some people are saying that she \"deserves\" it because she wears sleeveless tops.

Though he attempted putting up some resistance when troops made effort to take him into custody, he was not assaulted or subjected to brutalisation.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Nigerian Army, however, acknowledges the rights of individuals of expression but stressed that such rights \u201cmust be done within the confines of the law, bearing in mind the imperative for peace, and national security.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and emphasis, the IPOB remains proscribed. Therefore, any individual or group seen to be projecting and advancing the cause or activities of the group is viewed as brazenly challenging the constitutionality of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cMore worrisome was the fact that considering the prevailing security situation of the region, coupled with the ongoing Exercise Golden Dawn, his action could be a tacit endorsement and support for the proscribed group.

It is important to once again place on record that the allegation that he was brutalized is false and should be disregarded accordingly.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhile the NA would not allow IPOB and its sponsors to hold the region captive and allow the security situation to degenerate, it is instructive to restate that national interest supersedes any parochial consideration. Individuals or groups who fan the embers of violence are warned to desist or face the consequences of their actions. The ongoing Exercises are on course and will rid the region of all forms of criminality.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe peace-loving and law-abiding people of the South East are enjoined to please<\/p> <p>go about their normal activities, as efforts are ongoing to bring perpetrators of violence to book.

Meanwhile, the factory owners were spared from punishment.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s been eight years since the terrible tragedy but there was still a glint of tears in their eyes as they shared their suffering of having to lead life without their earning family members, who lost their lives in the inferno on Sept 11, 2012.<\/p> <p>Holding tightly to his walking stick to help him sit straight, Aziz Bhai, who lost his son in the fire, said that the court had said that the incident happened as a result of terrorism but he did not accept the decision.<\/p> <p>The widowed Saeeda Khatoon, who also lost her only son in the tragedy, said that more than 260 workers, who lost their lives that day, could have been saved had there been any safety measures in place at Ali Enterprises.<\/p> <p>\u2018Declaring the main accused owners of the factory innocent is making a mockery of the justice system\u2019<\/p> <p>\u2018Factory had no escape routes\u2019<\/p> <p>\u201cThe factory had no escape routes, and extra or back exits if there were any, were all blocked or locked. Still, if it is being said now that the tragedy was a result of terrorism, then the factory owners are the greatest terrorists here,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe need laws to make sure that no other factory becomes like Ali Enterprises. The factory was not registered. Its workers were not registered. For a while, from 2012 to 2017 we got some pension as per some pension plan but then it stopped. Isn\u2019t pension to be paid for life? We have lost our only earning family member. We demand our pensions be restored,\u201d she added.<\/p> <p>The affectees were joined by labour and human rights activists, who were also of the opinion that in the case of the Baldia factory incident, the real perpetrators have been allowed to go unscathed while the case has been politicised.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe bereaved families of martyred workers did not get justice this time. Declaring the main accu\u00adsed owners of the factory \u2018innocent\u2019 is like making mockery of the justice system. Due to lack of health and safety facilities, workplaces in Pakistan have become death traps for Pakistani workers. Investigation in the Baldia factory fire case was influenced by making different joint investigation teams [JITs]. The bereaved families were never accepted as a party in the case, which is against the basic principles of law and justice,\u201d said Nasir Mans\u00adoor, general secretary, Natio\u00adnal Trade Union Federation (NTUF).<\/p> <p>He explained that the main issue here was not whether it was an arson or accidental fire, but that the factory was not fitted with a proper firefighting system. All exits of the factory including its windows had iron bars. The firefighting equipment present there was not in working condition. The workers were not provided any training or drills to help them face emergencies. Even the factory was working illegally. Its construction design was not approved from the departments concerned, and these were the main reasons that resulted in the death of over 260 innocent workers.<\/p> <p>Brands violating labour laws to earn more profits<\/p> <p>\u201cIf the factory owners were being blackmailed or if they were receiving threats from extortionists, then they should have contacted the police while also taking safety measures in their factory which they did not do. The government is still a silent spectator to what happened and local and international brands are violating labour laws and standards in a race to earn more profits,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cEverybody is doing politics on the blood of the poor workers but no one is willing to help them in getting justice that can dress their wounds. It is a shame that Karachi, the largest industrial city of Pakistan, does not have any forensic laboratory even in the 21st century for doing DNA tests. Some 17 dead workers of the Baldia fire incident had to be buried without identification as their families are still waiting for the DNA matching certificate from the laboratory in Lahore,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Karamat Ali of Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (PILER) said that the factory fire happened in 2012 and they filed cases for criminal negligence against the factory owners. But sometime in 2015, the negligence issue was forgotten while terrorism took the main focus.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is no implementation of ILO conventions according to which annual inspection of factories is mandatory. International brands, their local suppliers and private social audit companies have made a wrongful alliance against the workers here and, sadly, the government is patronising them. This is tantamount to giving them a licence to kill workers,\u201d he pointed out.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is a supposed law of occupational health and safety in Sindh but it is not being implemented. The Sindh government declared the day of Sept 11 as the day of health and safety but strangely no programme or event was held on governmental level on this day. It is almost every week these days that we see an unfortunate factory or mines incident but just like rape cases, injustices against workers are not reported,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Zehra Akbar Khan, general secretary, Home-Based Women Workers Federation, raised the question that if the factory owners were receiving threats from extortionists then how come they decreased the number of guards at the factory around that time?<\/p> <p>Asad Iqbal Butt of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said: \u201cWe refuse to accept the politicised court order.

According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), security forces may have coordinated with unidentifiable gunmen during an overnight 6 December attack in Baghdad\u2019s al-Khilani Square that left dozens killed and more injured. Witnesses report Iraqi security forces abandoned the area shortly before the attack and returned minutes after it ended, cutting off electricity for at least an hour, immersing demonstrators in darkness during the onslaught.<\/p> <p>\u201cAll we could see was light coming from the bullets,\u201d said one protester describing the 4am attack.<\/p> <p>Palestine: Generational repression of civil rights<\/p> <p>A new report from HRW detailed how for more than 50 years, Israel has employed draconian military orders to suppress Palestinian nonviolent activity and decimate their basic civil rights, including freedom of expression and assembly.<\/p> <p>For instance, the 1967 military order 101 continues to criminalize participation in a gathering of more than ten people without a permit on an issue, which the army considers to be a political gathering punishable of up to ten years. The order also prohibits the publication of political materials or the display of flags or political symbols without army approval. Meanwhile, 2010\u2019s military order 1651 imposes a ten-year sentence on anyone who attempts to \u2013 orally or otherwise \u2013 influence public opinion in the West Bank in a manner that \u201cmay harm public peace or public order\u201d or \u201cpublishes words of praise, sympathy or support for a hostile organization, its actions or objectives,\u201d which the army defines as \u201cincitement.\u201d The vaguely worded order also states that \u201coffenses against authorities\u201d can carry a sentence of life imprisonment.<\/p> <p>The real-life consequences of these orders have been disastrous for civil society and non-violent actions in the West Bank. According to the report, between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2019, a total of 4,590 Palestinians were prosecuted for entering a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d \u2013 a designation the Israeli army imposes on protest sites in real-time \u2013 while 1,704 were prosecuted for \u201cmembership and activity in an unlawful association\u201d, and 358 for \u201cincitement.\u201d<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, in digital rights<\/p> <p>To mark last month\u2019s 16-days of activism against gender-based violence, the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media (7amleh) launched a campaign addressing the phenomenon of violence, harassment and extortion of Palestinian women online. The campaign saw social media influencers in the West Bank push the conversation online through infographics and multimedia, drawing on 7amleh\u2019s research on the issue, which revealed one-third of young, Palestinian women are subjected to violence or sexual harassment online.<\/p> <p>Saudi Arabia: a \u2018mockery of justice\u2019 for Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder<\/p> <p>It has been over a year since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into a Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul, never to be seen again. Late last month, the official investigation into his death came to a predictable end after the kingdom\u2019s public prosecutor office announced it had sentenced five people to death and handed out jail terms for three others allegedly complicit in his murder, calling the crime \u201cspontaneous\u201d and not premeditated.<\/p> <p>The Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) condemned the verdicts, noting the trial lacked the minimum standards of a fair trial and due process. The rights organization also called on international bodies to ensure top Saudi officials involved in the killing do not evade justice \u2013 a call reiterated by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).<\/p> <p>\u201cConducting a sham trial for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and sentencing five people to death shows that the Saudi government under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is committed to an ongoing mockery of justice,\u201d said CPJ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator, Sherif Mansour. \u201cThe international community, including the U.S., must not allow Saudi Arabia to keep evading justice in the Khashoggi case.\u201d<\/p> <p>Dr. Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, who investigated the killing and published her findings back in June 2019, called the verdict \u201cthe antithesis of justice\u201d. Callamard\u2019s UN report highlighted the extensive planning of the murder, and included audio from Turkish authorities in which a team of Saudi agents, while waiting for Khashoggi to arrive at the embassy to pick up necessary papers for his planned nuptials, can be overheard discussing how they would carry the body out of the building.<\/p> <p>Bottom line: the hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death. The masterminds not only walk free. They have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial. That is the antithesis of Justice. It is a mockery. \u2014 Agnes Callamard (@AgnesCallamard) December 23, 2019<\/p> <p>While Callamard\u2019s report concluded that the killing \u201cwas overseen, planned and endorsed by high-level officials,\u201d the recent verdict in Saudi Arabia has provided total immunity for those very officials in the chain of command, while scapegoating those tasked with carrying out the murder.<\/p> <p>The end-result sends a chilling message to dissidents from the region living in exile: that their safety abroad is far from secure.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is not just about the justice Jamal deserves, or even closure for his friends and family. This is also about deterrence; so another critic is not killed in London\u2019s Hyde Park, abducted from a Toronto suburb or assaulted in a D.C. bar,\u201d said Egyptian human rights advocate Mohamed Soltan in a Washington Post Op Ed. \u201cWhen we seek justice and accountability, we are not seeking to avenge Jamal\u2019s murder. We are attempting to secure an immediate future where we can live without constant fear of assassination and dismemberment.\u201d<\/p> <p>Egypt: \u201cSilence and collusion are not our choices\u201d<\/p> <p>https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/gamal.eid.90<\/p> <p>In Egypt, IFEX member and director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), Gamal Eid was attacked on a street near his Cairo home while waiting for a taxi.

While rebel group Jaysh Al-Islam is widely believed to be behind their abduction, they remain among some 98,000 Syrians forcibly disappeared since March 2011 whose fate remains unknown.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, digital activists have pushed back on Twitter\u2019s recent announcement that it would be deleting inactive accounts, which would include those of forcibly disappeared activists like Razan Zaitouneh and those killed, such as slain radio host Raed Fares. \u201cDeleting their accounts could deal a significant blow to the Syrian memory as well as deprive us of vital evidence for use in justice and accountability processes,\u201d said Syrian Archive\u2019s co-founder, Hadi Al-Khatib in a recent interview.<\/p> <p>UAE<\/p> <p>The security apparatus has targeted dozens of relatives of Emirati dissidents who are either currently detained or living abroad. According to HRW, relatives of eight dissidents have seen their citizenships revoked, have been arbitrarily denied access to services, and have faced restrictions placed on their ability to access jobs and higher education. Relatives have also been subject to state surveillance, threats, and regular questioning by security officials who are empowered by a 2003 federal law granting the security apparatus a wide mandate to curb political activity, by force if necessary.<\/p> <p>Documenting the region<\/p> <p>Finally, in its annual global survey, CPJ says the number of imprisoned journalists in the region has risen, with Egypt and Saudi Arabia now ranked as the third worst jailers in the world after China. Meanwhile, although the number of journalists killed has fallen globally, Syria remains the deadliest country, with seven journalists killed in 2019.<\/p> <p>If you enjoyed this, check out all the

Crimes Foretold: Delhi Riots' FIR 59\/2020 and the 'Meerut Conspiracy\u2019 Parable","Input.publish_date":"2020-05-11 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The investigating agencies inquiring into the Delhi riots have worked uncompromisingly through the coronavirus pandemic. I doubt officers have had any time for their families, let alone for parables. Here\u2019s hoping they will indulge me, because I see in the Delhi Riots Conspiracy Case the police have come up with clear shades of the Meerut Conspiracy Case of 1929.<\/p> <p>It was a little more than 90 years ago that Viceroy Irwin \u2013 miffed with the relentless anti-imperialist agitations in India involving everyone from students, workers and peasants \u2013 tried to devise some way to cripple the nationalist Indian leadership and certain British socialists whom he was convinced were behind the protests. Secret communications flew thick and fast between the viceroy and the India Office in London, and a new law was proposed to give the government of India the power to remove any political organiser from British India, or even bar left-leaning Indians from travelling abroad so as not to expose them to further ideas.<\/p> <p>However, this proposed law, the \u2018Public Safety Bill\u2019, was defeated in the Indian legislative assembly in September 1928 because of the concerted efforts of nationalist members. During the assembly debates, Lala Lajpat Rai scoffed at the idea that the special law was necessitated by the presence of two British Communists who had been organising workers\u2019 strikes in support of the freedom movement. It was absurd to suppose that a few men could be instrumental in bringing about such widespread expressions of dissent, he said. Srinivas Iyengar also opposed the Bill on the grounds that \u2018no proof had been furnished that the British government was going to be destroyed or Indian society subverted [because of such hartals]. It was the will of a police officer, a district officer or a commercial magnate strong enough to press his view, which the governor-general-in-council accepted without enquiry\u2019.<\/p> <p>In the aftermath of this defeat, which was seen as a nationalist victory, the colonial government announced it would reintroduce the Bill in the next session, and followed the announcement with an unyielding, single-minded campaign denouncing the \u2018communist menace\u2019 and propagating the idea that the defeat of the Bill was detrimental to the security of the state.<\/p> <p>Lord Irwin, for his part, sent another secret missive to the Secretary of State in Britain:<\/p> <p>\u201cAlthough these movements are still in their infancy and may not be a serious menace in India for some little time, nevertheless they contain great potentialities of danger, and we are bound therefore to see what steps can be taken to discourage them while they are weak and prevent anything in the nature of rapid growth. We must consider what we can do in the way of preventing the Indian movement, which by itself is very weak, from receiving any impetus from outside either in the form of money or what is still more important, of brains and organizing capacity [\u2026] The Public Safety Bill as you have seen was defeated in the Assembly by the President\u2019s casting vote and I have been carefully considering what lines we should take in the matter. We hope to run a conspiracy case against a considerable number of communists in India.\u2019 [From Sir David Petrie and Sir Horace Williamson, Directors of Intelligence, Unpublished Papers, Edited by Saha, emphasis added]<\/p> <p>The conspiracy case was run indeed, for four-and-a-half long years. Jurist and constitutional expert A.G. Noorani says that uniquely amongst political trials even, the stated objective of the \u2018Meerut Conspiracy Case\u2019 was not to secure the conviction of the 32 accused, but rather to crush the imminent Civil Disobedience Movement. \u2018The accused were to be punished for the beliefs they held; not for any illegal act they had committed.\u2019<\/p> <p>The Public Safety Bill was to be reintroduced in the assembly on March 21, 1929. On the evening of March 20, raids were conducted in Bombay, Calcutta, Allahabad, Delhi, Lahore and other places: in houses, trade unions and at newspaper offices. Thirty-two people, members of the AICC and AITUC, the Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Party, were arrested and tried in Meerut. Although only two of the 32 arrested were from Meerut, it was chosen as the seat of trial by the prosecution in order to deny the benefit of a jury trial to the accused.<\/p> <p>The end result, however, was far from satisfactory for the colonial authorities.<\/p> <p>Delhi riots and FIR 59\/2020<\/p> <p>Ninety kilometres and 91 years separate Meerut and Delhi and the two conspiracy cases but it is hard not to miss the similarity between the political impulse behind both.<\/p> <p>FIR 59\/2020 was filed at the instance of a sub-Inspector, and on the basis of information received from an unnamed police informer. It states that the Delhi riots were planned by certain persons, who used the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests as an opportunity to mobilise the masses against the government of the day. Specifically, it alleges that speeches were given that encouraged people to protest in the streets during US President Donald Trump\u2019s Delhi visit, with the aim to internationally further the \u2018propaganda\u2019 that minorities were being oppressed in India.<\/p> <p>Normally, FIRs refrain from making political statements. Sometimes, they reproduce the offending speech, verbatim, but it is unusual for an FIR to denounce a political assertion as \u2018propaganda\u2019. Whether minorities are in fact being oppressed in India is a political question, or, in specific cases, a judicial one, so it is certainly odd that the FIR pronounces it propaganda and delegitimises the entire protest at the very outset.<\/p> <p>The FIR does not mention any invocation to violence in the speeches. Yet, remarkably, it invokes Sections 147 [rioting], 148 [rioting armed with deadly weapons], 149 [being a member of a common assembly and acting in common object] and 120 B [criminal conspiracy], thus treating all anti-CAA protestors (and all protests across India) as a single collective rioting agent, while never once explicitly alleging that the protestors rioted.<\/p> <p>Also Read: Delhi Riots 2020: There Was a Conspiracy, But Not the One the Police Alleges<\/p> <p>There is a single reference to information being received that certain homes in northeast Delhi had stored firearms, petrol bombs, acid and stones, but there is no obvious connection of these homes with the protest. Even if the allegation were that some of these homeowners had attended the protests, it is not clear why their individual culpabilities in their homes would turn the entire protest into a rioting collective.<\/p> <p>Derren Brown is a fascinating \u2018mentalist\u2019, or illusionist: he can manipulate any audience into thinking in a particular way. He says he does it by subtly and repeatedly inserting an idea into their heads. Thus, if at the beginning of a show he refers to someone as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019, and casually continues to do so during his act, he can get his audience to react to that person in a particular way by the end of the show.<\/p> <p>FIR 59\/2020 turns the protestors into rioters in peoples\u2019 minds, without alleging any instance of collective violence by the assembly. The fact of the assembly itself is treated as an offence.<\/p> <p>The FIR records that women and children deliberately blocked the road outside the Jaffrabad metro station, inconveniencing others and adding to the tense atmosphere, such that riots broke out. It is silent on who was apparently so provoked by the protestors that they felt that violent action to clear them out was justified. It does not attribute any violence to the protestors at Jaffrabad, but it implies that blocking the road and inconveniencing others was \u2018violence\u2019 in itself, which led to retaliatory action by others.<\/p> <p>There was a time when the familiar trope for orchestrating a riot was slaughtering a pig and throwing it outside a mosque; or leaving a bag of meat in a temple; or pelting stones at a religious place or a religious gathering. Each of these actions, deliberate attempts to provoke communal violence, were offences in themselves.<\/p> <p>FIR 59\/2020 has successfully changed that trope by equating the anti-CAA protests with such provocation, proclaiming the protestors collectively as rioters, and suggesting that minority dissent to an idea that has popular support otherwise is in itself, a provocative act, and good reason for the outbreak of riots. In its silence on those who actually retaliated violently to the protests, it treats them as automated bots responding to \u2018protest provocation\u2019, and seems to find no reason to go into their individual and active roles.<\/p> <p>The FIR also doesn\u2019t look at the \u2018charged circumstances\u2019 as a gradual build-up: what accentuating circumstances turned the protests into a hateful thing for non-participants? It is not common in our country for any section of people to feel provoked by any other group \u2013 or indeed by the government \u2013 for merely having been \u2018inconvenienced\u2019. What was the role of certain leaders, or that of the media, in turning the protestors into monsters? What were the omissions, if any, on the part of the administration and the police? FIR 59 rather treats the fact of the protests as an apriori reason for retaliatory violence.<\/p> <p>Be that as it may, it is altogether possible for any peaceful protest to become disorderly at any given moment, due to extraneous circumstances, or from a generally charged atmosphere.<\/p> <p>Also Read: Delhi Police Affidavit Shows Muslims Bore Brunt of Riots, Silent on Who Targeted Them and Why<\/p> <p>While the constitution of India guarantees the right to assemble peacefully under Article 19(1)(b), this right is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India and of public order. If a public assembly has the potential of becoming unruly, or causing others to become unruly, the police have the responsibility to disperse it using minimal and proportionate force.<\/p> <p>Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code says that an assembly may be designated an \u2018unlawful assembly\u2019 if it commits any criminal trespass, or any other offence, or if it deprives any person of the right of way, etc. An assembly that was not previously lawful may be designated \u2018unlawful\u2019 with changing circumstances.<\/p> <p>Upon such designation, if a breach of peace seems imminent, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Police Manuals describe a detailed code of conduct, which includes involving officers of the administration to persuade the protestors to disperse, followed by warning, and then application of minimal and proportionate force [Sections 129 and 130 of the CrPC The police also have the right to detain members of the unlawful assembly during the process of dispersal, or to preventively detain its leaders].<\/p> <p>Post-facto prosecutions are possible, too: Sections 142 to 145 of the Indian Penal Code describe offences that range from knowingly being a member of an unlawful assembly, to being present in an unlawful assembly while armed with a deadly weapon, which, when used \u2018as a weapon of offence\u2019, is likely to cause death. All these offences are cognizable and bailable.<\/p> <p>\u2018Deep-rooted conspiracy\u2019<\/p> <p>FIR 59 does not frame the alleged unruliness in terms of applicable law, which assesses the unlawfulness of an assembly \u2018in the moment\u2019. It frames it in terms of \u2018a deep-rooted conspiracy\u2019: of political action that opposed the CAA, and was implicitly \u2018seditious\u2019 and provocative, and which must, therefore, be the focus of all investigations relating to the riots.<\/p> <p>There have been several arrests, some even under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), mostly of students and activists involved in the protest. Many others have been summoned, amongst them writers and teachers, art workers and filmmakers, people who are otherwise called \u2018intellectuals\u2019, purveyors of new ideas.<\/p> <p>In investigating the intellectuals, the police are really investigating their ideas. \u2018Why do you oppose the citizen amendment act? Why do you support street protests that inconvenience people? Why were you actively mobilizing people in support? What do you want so much \u2018azadi\u2019 for? You people have been allowed too much freedom in the past.\u2019<\/p> <p>It is not unknown for the police to question political ideas; however, the \u2018midnight knock\u2019 is associated with authoritarian regimes. In India, on the other hand, the constitution has allowed for loud political dissent. Even protests that embarrass the government of the day have ordinarily not been subject to investigative scrutiny under special acts.<\/p> <p>Mobilising support for a political idea is a democratic process, even when it seeks to rupture or dislodge a prevailing discourse. In my experience, I\u2019ve seen the Babri masjid-Ramjanambhoomi movement redefine Indian selfhood, significantly rupturing previously held notions. Politically, and peacefully, it is not illegal to mobilise even to make the polity \u2018mukt\u2019 from a certain party or ideology (although to make it \u2018mukt\u2019 of a people would amount to hate speech\/ genocide). It is not a \u2018shadowy conspiracy\u2019 to suggest that the government of the day is apathetic to a section of the population. Those claims have often been made: most forcefully, in fact, by the ruling party in its assertion that the incumbents practised appeasement and neglected the majority.<\/p> <p>The contours of a penal offence, as different from dissenting politics, are very well defined. Demonstrations and street protests are not in themselves seditious or dangerous. If they block traffic, they may be dealt with under applicable sections of the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes. What is indeed an offence is a direct call to violence at such a demonstration and a causal and immediate link between the speech and actual violence.<\/p> <p>The Tilak sedition trial<\/p> <p>FIR 59 has, in fact, moved the clock even further back than 1929, to Bal Gangadhar Tilak\u2019s sedition trial of 1897. In Tilak\u2019s trial, the presiding judge, Justice Strachey, expanded the meaning of sedition, from violently inciting people against the government, to include general lack of affection for it. Thus any show of bitterness, or suspicion, or any speech or writing that might encourage others to like the government any less was termed seditious. Tilak was sent to jail for writing against the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, promulgated during the Bombay plague, which gave the British administration wide regulatory powers over the local population.<\/p> <p>Also Read: How Bal Gangadhar Tilak\u2019s 1897 Trial Marked the Criminalisation of Dissent<\/p> <p>The post-independence Indian Supreme Court, on the other hand, categorically rejects that forceful discursive criticisms of the government and its policies are bases for sedition. It has employed the \u2018spark in the powder keg\u2019 test, which denotes speech or action that is as immediately incendiary as a lit fuse (chanting \u2018goli maro\u2026\u2019 in close proximity to, and with reference to a group of people; and if soon thereafter somebody actually fires on a representative sections of that group, for instance). FIR 59 on the other hand, implies an \u2018embers in the wind\u2019 theory: it criminalises sustained criticism of the government, ostensibly on grounds that this has the potential to cause disaffection. Unfortunately, the claim has no basis in law.<\/p> <p>In its construction of the anti-CAA protests, FIR 59 is not neutral. It takes the position that these political protests were based on misrepresentations, were anti-state and treacherous. By doing so, it criminalises arguments around minority rights and against the CAA; it makes suspect any kind of protest against the government, and it normalises the humiliation of scores of teachers and students when they are summoned to police stations and interrogated for their participation in the protests. FIR 59 makes believable even the most absurd, uncorroborated allegations about the grave \u2018conspiracy\u2019 of the protests, and thus equally acceptable that the police should take several extensions on the submission of the chargesheet \u2013 the substantiation of the allegations in the FIR \u2013 while accused wait in jail.<\/p> <p>Back to the future<\/p> <p>To come back to the Meerut Conspiracy Case, the investigations produced 25 printed, folio-sized volumes of documentary evidence. Three thousand five hundred prosecution exhibits and about 320 witnesses from across Britain and India sought to prove the political activities of the accused and their associations with each other. It was officially announced at the end of the trial that the process had cost 126,000 pounds.<\/p> <p>However, at the end of proceedings in 1933, the high court let off the accused with minimal sentences. It also so happened that over the four-and-half-years, the proceedings attracted a lot of sympathetic interest in the political issues at hand, both in India and abroad. There was an outcry in the British press and parliament: the conservative government even lost the general election of May 1929. Neither was the anti-colonial political movement seriously affected, apparently because it had mass appeal, beyond its few organisers who had been arrested.<\/p> <p>It has been said that the process left Lord Irwin and also the Secretary of State quite \u2018disillusioned\u2019. The Lord wrote to the Secretary \u2018that he wished to heaven he had not embarked on the Meerut Trial\u2019, and the Secretary of State confided that he would be \u2018devoutly thankful when the whole thing is over and done with.\u2019 Lord Irwin\u2019s successor, Viceroy Willingdon declared summarily that he would \u2018pretty well assure that there were no more of the terrible conspiracy cases while he was Viceroy\u2019.<\/p> <p>As the Delhi conspiracy cases drag on, will their architects similarly wish they never went down this path?<\/p> <p>Shahrukh Alam is a lawyer practising in New Delhi<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3B0MCRZMBT927MVBGMH1FTRV039PP8"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":843,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Delhi","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"atudents, activists","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Delhi","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"atudents, activists","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":996385245,"Input.title":"Hong Kong police arrest 5 speech therapists over children's books deemed seditious","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-23 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Hong Kong police arrest 5 speech therapists over children's books deemed seditious<\/p> <p>Show Caption Hide Caption Hong Kong pro-democracy paper Apple Daily to print final edition The paper began printing a million copies of its final edition Wednesday evening after authorities froze its assets.

These restrictions, not based on an individualized assessment of security risk, robbed with rare exceptions the 2 million Palestinians living there of their right to freedom of movement, limited their access to electricity and water, and devastated the economy. Eighty percent of Gaza\u2019s residents depend on humanitarian aid.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities also facilitated the further transfer of Israeli citizens into settlements in the occupied West Bank, a war crime. The Israeli group Peace Now said that Israeli officials in 2020 advanced plans for more housing units in West Bank settlements, 12,159 as of October 15, more than in any other year since it began tracking these statistics in 2012.<\/p> <p>According to the UN Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of October 19, 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 568 Palestinian homes and other structures in the West Bank this year, including in East Jerusalem, displacing 759 people. Most buildings were demolished for lacking Israeli building permits, which are virtually impossible to obtain. As the Covid-19 pandemic spread between March and August, Israel averaged its highest home demolition rate in four years, OCHA found. On November 3, Israeli authorities razed the homes of most residents of the Palestinian community of Khirbet Humsah in the Jordan Valley for being in an area it designated as a \u201cfiring zone,\u201d displacing 73 people, 41 of them children.<\/p> <p>The coalition agreement between the Likud and Blue and White parties that led to the formation of an Israeli government in May, after three rounds of elections in the preceding year, established a process to bring annexation of additional parts of the West Bank for approval. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in August that Israel would delay the move following an agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, but that \u201cthere is no change to my plan to extend sovereignty\u201d over the West Bank.<\/p> <p>Both the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Hamas authorities in Gaza detained opponents and critics for their peaceful expression and tortured some in their custody. The Palestinian statutory watchdog, Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), received 269 complaints of arbitrary arrests, 147 against the PA and 122 by Hamas; 90 complaints of torture and ill-treatment, 40 against the PA and 50 against Hamas, and 62 complaints against the PA of detention without trial or charge pursuant to orders from a regional governor between January and September 2020. The number of complaints decreased compared to previous years, which the ICHR attributes primarily to the fewer prison visits it conducted amid the pandemic.<\/p> <p>Gaza Strip<\/p> <p>Although fighting between Israel and Palestinian armed groups decreased compared to previous years, Israeli authorities maintained their closure of Gaza, alongside restrictions Egypt maintains on its border. Palestinian armed groups, as of October 21, fired 187 unguided rockets or mortar shells towards Israeli population centers in 2020, according to the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, inherently indiscriminate attacks that amount to war crimes.<\/p> <p>Incendiary balloons launched into Israel by Palestinians in Gaza prompted Israeli authorities in August in retaliation to limit the entry into Gaza of goods, including food and medicine, to block access to Gaza\u2019s territorial waters for Palestinian fishermen and to slash fuel imports to Gaza\u2019s power plant, further reducing the already limited supply of electricity for almost three weeks. These measures, targeting Gaza\u2019s general civilian population, amount to unlawful collective punishment.<\/p> <p>In August, Gaza recorded its first cases of community transmission of coronavirus. Hamas authorities, which since March had required returning residents to spend 21 days in quarantine at centers they oversee, imposed a 14-day lockdown and other restrictive measures. As of October 19, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry had recorded 4,722 Covid-19 cases and 28 deaths, most of them since August.<\/p> <p>Israeli Closure<\/p> <p>Israel restricted the ability of most Gaza residents to travel through the Erez Crossing, the sole passenger crossing from Gaza into Israel through which Palestinians travel to the West Bank and abroad. A generalized travel ban applies to all Palestinians except those whom Israeli authorities deem as presenting \u201cexceptional humanitarian circumstances,\u201d mostly those needing vital medical treatment and their companions, as well as prominent business people.<\/p> <p>During January and February, an average of 778 Palestinians in Gaza exited via Erez each day, a fraction of the daily average of more than 24,000 before the beginning of the second Intifada in September 2000, according to the Israeli rights group, Gisha. After Israel tightened the closure amid the pandemic, that figure plummeted between April and September to about nine people per day.<\/p> <p>In May, the PA suspended security and administrative coordination with Israel, including the issuance of travel permits, in response to Israel\u2019s annexation plans. This move left Gaza residents with no clear way to apply for permits, since Israeli authorities do not have a formal physical presence inside Gaza and did not create alternative mechanisms to accept applications directly. Several organizations in June began applying on behalf of Palestinians with scheduled appointments for urgent medical care outside Gaza and the World Health Organization (WHO) took on the coordination role in September. According to data received by the WHO, Israel denied or failed to respond in a timely manner to 54 percent of such applications in June. In November, the PA said that it would resume security and administrative coordination with Israel.<\/p> <p>Gaza\u2019s exports between January and September, mostly destined for the West Bank and Israel, averaged 256 truckloads per month, compared to the monthly average of 1,064 truckloads prior to the June 2007 tightening of the closure, according to Gisha. Israel also sharply restricted and often prohibited the entry of what they deem \u201cdual-use\u201d materials, items that could be used for military purposes. The list included X-ray and communications equipment, construction materials, spare parts and batteries for assistive devices used by people with disabilities, and other vital civilian items.<\/p> <p>Families in Gaza on average received slightly more than 12 hours of electricity a day during the first nine months of 2020, according to OCHA. Chronic prolonged power outages encumber everyday life, in particular for people with disabilities who rely on light to communicate using sign language or equipment powered by electricity, such as elevators or electric wheelchairs, to move. More than 96 percent of groundwater in Gaza is \u201cunfit for human consumption,\u201d OCHA found. According to the WHO, 47 percent of what it deems to be \u201cessential\u201d medicines were at zero stock level (less than one month's supply) at Gaza\u2019s Central Drug Store at the end of September.<\/p> <p>Egypt also sharply restricted the movement of people and goods at its Rafah crossing with Gaza, including restricting entry to those who do not have a Palestinian ID because Israel did not include them in the population registry they control. In the first nine months of 2020, an average of 4,767 Palestinians crossed monthly in both directions, less than the monthly average of 12,172 in 2019 and over 40,000 before the 2013 military coup in Egypt, according to Gisha.<\/p> <p>Hamas and Palestinian Armed Groups in Gaza<\/p> <p>Hamas authorities provided no information about two Israeli civilians with psychosocial disabilities, Avera Mangistu and Hisham al-Sayed, whom they have apparently held in violation of international law for more than five years after they entered Gaza.<\/p> <p>In April, Hamas authorities detained seven activists for participating in a video chat where they answered questions from Israeli civilians about life in Gaza. Two were detained for more than six months and three were convicted under military law of \u201cweakening the revolutionary spirit.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hamas authorities carried out no executions in 2020; they had carried out 25, following trials marred with due process violations, since they took control in Gaza in June 2007. Courts in Gaza had, as of November 2, sentenced 145 people to death in that time, according to the Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights.<\/p> <p>A British Mandate-era law still in force in Gaza punishes \u201cunnatural intercourse\u201d of a sexual nature, understood to include same-sex relationships, with up to 10 years in prison, although Human Rights Watch has not documented detentions for same-sex conduct.<\/p> <p>West Bank<\/p> <p>Israeli Use of Force & Detentions<\/p> <p>In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Israeli security forces killed 20 Palestinians and wounded at least 2,001 as of October 5, according to OCHA, including those alleged to have attacked Israelis, but also those uninvolved in violence.<\/p> <p>On May 30, Israeli border police in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City fatally shot an unarmed 32-year-old Palestinian man with autism, Eyad al-Hallaq, after he reportedly fled when they asked him to stop. According to what an officer on the scene reportedly told Israeli investigators, police shot him in a \u201cclosed space\u201d where he did not \u201cendanger\u201d anyone. In October, authorities indicated that they will likely charge the officer who shot al-Hallaq with reckless homicide, pending a pretrial hearing.<\/p> <p>On June 23, border police shot and killed, apparently unlawfully, 26-year-old Ahmed Erekat after his car crashed into a checkpoint and he exited the vehicle in circumstances where he did not appear to pose an imminent threat to life. Authorities characterized the incident as a car-ramming attack; his family said it was an accident.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities have rarely held accountable security forces who used excessive force or settlers who attacked Palestinians.<\/p> <p>Settler violence against Palestinians during the first five months of 2020 remained at 2019 levels, a marked increase from prior years, OCHA found. Settlers killed one Palestinian civilian, wounded 103, and caused property damage in 136 incidents as of October 5, according to OCHA.<\/p> <p>Palestinian attackers killed one Israeli soldier and wounded at least 28 Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, as of September 22.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities in September said they would continue withholding the bodies of Palestinians killed in what they consider security incidents primarily as leverage to secure Hamas\u2019s release of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers presumed killed in 2014 hostilities. Israel held, as of September, the bodies of 67 Palestinians killed since 2015, according to the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center.<\/p> <p>In the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya, Israeli forces arrested 850 Palestinians between April 2019 and April 2020, according to the Israeli rights group, B\u2019Tselem, as part of an \u201congoing campaign of abuse\u201d against its residents.<\/p> <p>In April, Israeli police shut down a coronavirus testing center set up by residents in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan on the grounds that it operated with PA assistance.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities closely monitor online speech by Palestinians, in part relying on predictive algorithms to determine whom to target, and have detained Palestinians based on social media posts and other expressive activity.<\/p> <p>As of August 31, according to Israeli Prison Services figures, Israel held 4,207 Palestinians in custody for \u201csecurity\u201d offenses, including 153 children, many for throwing stones, and 355 in administrative detention without formal charges or trial and based on secret evidence.<\/p> <p>While applying Israeli civil law to settlers, Israeli authorities govern West Bank Palestinians, excluding Jerusalem residents, under harsh military law. In so doing, they deny them basic due process and try them in military courts with a near-100 percent conviction rate. Israel incarcerates many Palestinians from the OPT inside Israel, complicating family visits and violating international humanitarian law\u2019s prohibition against their transfer outside occupied territory.<\/p> <p>Settlements & Home Demolitions<\/p> <p>Israel allocated additional confiscated Palestinian land to unlawful settlements and provided security, infrastructure, and services for more than 647,000 settlers residing in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.<\/p> <p>In June, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court struck down a law allowing authorities to retroactively expropriate land on which settlements had been built but that Israel acknowledged to be privately owned by Palestinians. In its justification, however, the court cited \u201cless harmful tools\u201d that could have the same effect, including a military order that upholds land deals when authorities reasonably believed at the time of sale that the land was not privately owned, effectively approving the unlawful expropriations.<\/p> <p>Jerusalem courts in several cases ordered the eviction of Palestinian families from homes in which they had lived for decades in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan largely based on discriminatory laws that favor claims that the land belonged to Jewish owners before 1948 or that allow the state to take over land as \u201cabsentee property.\u201d<\/p> <p>The difficulty in obtaining Israeli building permits in East Jerusalem and the 60 percent of the West Bank under Israel\u2019s exclusive control (Area C) has driven Palestinians to construct housing, schools, and business structures that are at constant risk of demolition or confiscation for being unauthorized. OCHA considered, as of April 2020, 46 Palestinian West Bank communities to be at \u201chigh risk of forcible transfer\u201d due to coercive Israeli policies. International law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property unless \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for \u201cmilitary operations.\u201d<\/p> <p>Freedom of Movement for Palestinians<\/p> <p>Israel continued to enforce its permit regime requiring Palestinian ID holders with rare exceptions to apply for time-limited permits from the Israeli army to enter large parts of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. B\u2019Tselem describes this as \u201can arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bureaucratic system\u201d where \u201cmany applications are denied without explanation, with no real avenue for appeal.\u201d Israeli authorities, as of June, maintained nearly 600 checkpoints and other permanent obstacles within the West Bank, in addition to nearly 1,500 ad-hoc \u201cflying\u201d checkpoints erected between April 2019 and March 2020, according to OCHA. Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation.<\/p> <p>The separation barrier, which Israel said it built for security reasons but 85 percent of which falls within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line separating Israeli from Palestinian territory, cuts off thousands of Palestinians from their agricultural lands. It also isolates 11,000 Palestinians who live on the western side of the barrier but are not allowed to travel to Israel and whose ability to cross the barrier to access their property and basic services is highly restricted.<\/p> <p>The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank<\/p> <p>As of October 21, the PA reported 43,308 Covid-19 cases and 399 deaths since the outbreak began in the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem. While at times imposing restrictions across the parts of the West Bank where it manages affairs, it has largely relied on localized lockdowns of areas that experience a surge in cases.<\/p> <p>Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh pledged in July 2019 to end arbitrary arrests. In June, PA forces detained journalist Sami al-Sai for three weeks over suspicions that he administered a Facebook page that had posted information about PA corruption. PA forces in July arrested about 20 activists in Ramallah heading to a protest about PA corruption, detaining them for more than a week, and prosecuting them on charges of gathering illegally and violating restrictive Covid-19 measures.<\/p> <p>PA personal status laws discriminated against women, including in relation to marriage, divorce, and decisions relating to custody of children and inheritance. Women\u2019s rights groups documented an increase in reports of domestic violence during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. However, Palestine has no comprehensive domestic violence law. The PA is considering a draft family protection law, but women\u2019s rights groups have raised concern that it does not go far enough to prevent abuse and protect survivors.<\/p> <p>Israel<\/p> <p>Israel had registered 306,649 Covid-19 cases and 2,278 deaths, including in East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements, as of October 21. Israel instituted lockdowns between late March and early May, and again between late September and mid-October. To track Covid-19, Israeli authorities authorized Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security service, to collect from telecommunications providers, beginning in March, vast amounts of location-tracking data from the cellphones of ordinary Israelis without their consent. The Knesset in July authorized the surveillance for six months, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in April that the government must bring the program under legislation.<\/p> <p>In June, the Knesset renewed a temporary order in place since 2003 that bars, with few exceptions, granting long-term legal status or residency inside Israel to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents, in many cases forcing the separation of families.<\/p> <p>Thousands of Israelis participated in weekly demonstrations beginning in June, primarily against the government\u2019s handling of Covid-19 and corruption charges against Prime Minister Netanyahu. Israeli police forcibly dispersed several demonstrations and beat and arrested scores of protesters. The Israeli group Human Rights Defenders Fund said that between July 14 and 26 in Jerusalem alone it provided legal counsel to more than 150 demonstrators who had been detained.<\/p> <p>Israeli authorities continued to systematically deny asylum claims of the roughly 32,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers in the country. To pressure them to leave, the government tries to make their lives \u201cmiserable,\u201d in the words of Israel\u2019s interior minister in 2012, through restrictions on movement, work permits, and access to health care. The Supreme Court in April struck down a law that permitted confiscation of a portion of their salaries.<\/p> <p>Key International Actors<\/p> <p>The United States in January presented a plan that purports to offer a two-state solution but envisions permanent Israeli domination over large swaths of the West Bank and formal annexation of settlements, the Jordan Valley, and other parts of Area C, while setting conditions that would make the realization of a Palestinian state nearly impossible. In June, members of the US Congress raised concerns about annexation in letters to Prime Minister Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.<\/p> <p>In response to the US plan, 27 European Union member states, including Germany and France, called for ensuring equal rights for Palestinians and Israelis. Over the year, the EU repeatedly urged Israel to abandon annexation plans and halt settlement construction, highlighting their illegality under international humanitarian law; however, strong divisions among EU member states have so far frustrated attempts to adopt punitive EU measures in response to Israel\u2019s persistent and serious violations of international humanitarian law.<\/p> <p>In February, the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released the long-awaited database of businesses that have enabled or profited from settlements, listing 112 businesses.<\/p> <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor\u2019s office concluded its preliminary examination of the Palestine situation in December 2019 and determined that all the necessary criteria to proceed with a formal investigation of alleged serious crimes by Israelis and Palestinians had been met. However, it requested guidance from the court\u2019s judges on the ICC\u2019s territorial jurisdiction before commencing a probe.

A who person suffers greatly or dies for the nation or motherland rather than give up and the ones never accept slavery can die willingly for the motherland, that become Martyrs.<\/p> <p>Martyrs devote their everything for their nation, motherland and other beliefs. Similarly, in Balochistan there are have been lots of selfless sons and daughters, whom we regards as national martyrs, have sacrificed their precious lives for their motherland. The Baloch Martyrs Day is on 13 November 1839 \u2013 the day when British colonial forces attack Balochistan and the Baloch ruler of the time Mr Mehrab Khan chose martyrdom over surrender and slavery. It is day of great pride for Baloch nation as Mir Mehrab Khan and his comrades resisted against the British army and had fought bravely against them till the end of their lives, but they did not quite the battle or run away from the battlefield.<\/p> <p>He surely knew that it was not easy to defeat an army armed with sophisticated weapons and in large number and kept the culture of resistance alive and did not submit before the might of enemy forces. He greatly fought and embraced martyrdom on 13 November 1839.<\/p> <p>This was not the first and last Baloch resistance or foreign attack against Balochistan because after the British left their legacy of divide and rule or weaken and occupy remained intact. Pakistan and Iran begun their expansionism and evil designs against Baloch nation. Even though the British had divided Balochistan but before leaving the sub-continent, they recognised the independence of Eastern part of Balochistan (currently occupied by Pakistan).<\/p> <p>The freedom, however, was short-lived because the British brainchild Pakistan started its conspiracy and eventually occupied Balochistan in March 1948 after the Baloch nation overwhelmingly rejected to merge their country with Pakistan on the basis of religion. Hence, the Baloch war of liberation was once again intensified.<\/p> <p>Even today, the Baloch brave sons and daughters are sacrificing their lives for the freedom and a dignified future. The Pakistani and Iranian intelligence agencies and armies are committing war crimes in Balochistan by using excessive force and brutalities but the resolve and determination of brave Baloch fighters is unbreakable. Those of young men, women and children who have been martyred for Balochistan.<\/p> <p>Thousands of brightest and educated people in Balochistan including journalists, writers, teachers, leaders, students have been abducted and disappeared for years, tortured and killed in custody by Pakistani forces. An example is the case of Abdul Hameed Hayathan Baloch, a young journalist who was abducted from Gwadar on 25 October 2010 and on November 18 his body was found beside the river Sami in Turbat area of district Kech in Balochistan. The body of a student, Hamid Ismail was alongside Hayathan Baloch\u2019s found on Eid day and a massage found with the bodies that\u201d Eid present for Baloch people\u201d these were the words of Pakistani forces. This act of sheer savageness by Pakistani forces shows their hatred against Baloch nation and their frightfulness from the educated Baloch youth.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, on 26 April, a Baloch artist Minhaj Mukhtar was attacked by Pakistani forces fire and terrorised his family members including women and children. On June 1st Saba Dashtyari, a professor at the University of Balochistan and one of the greatest poets and writers was shot by unidentified gunmen in the provincial capital Quetta, in a public place. As like on 10 Feb 2011, Jamil Yaqub\u2019s body were bearing marks of torture was found on the outskirts of Turbat.<\/p> <p>Moreover, the Pakistani and Iranian state crimes have become so common in Balochistan that with the passage of time the number of Baloch martyrs continue to increase. Baloch women children, elderly and people from all spheres of life are being killed in Balochistan only for raise voice for the freedom of their motherland and being Baloch. The occupiers of Baloch nation on both sides of the artificial border are killing Baloch indiscriminately.<\/p> <p>Today, Balochistan feels proud to have brave sons and daughters who are willing to die for their for the freedom and dignity of their motherland.

The centers are euphemistically portrayed as inviting learning camps equipped with volleyball courts and ping-pong tables. However, newly obtained tender documents show that those interned inside the camps are treated more like prisoners than students. In addition to textbooks, items listed on local government shopping lists and procurement outlays for the facilities include tear gas, tasers, police batons, and handcuffs. Ben Dooley at AFP reports:<\/p> <p>Around April 2017, local governments began posting a wide variety of tenders related to the facilities. Some orders \u2014 furniture, air conditioners, bunk beds, cutlery \u2014 would not seem out of place at a typical Chinese university. But others resembled prison equipment: sophisticated surveillance systems, cameras for recording students in their rooms, razor wire, a system for eavesdropping on phone calls, and infrared monitoring devices. The centres also bought police uniforms, riot shields and helmets, pepper spray, tear gas, net guns, stun guns, electrified batons, billy clubs, spears, handcuffs and spiked clubs known as \u201cwolf\u2019s teeth\u201d. At least one centre requested \u201ctiger chairs\u201d, a device used by Chinese police to restrain interrogation subjects.

From John Sudworth:<\/p> <p>There is a striking conclusion \u2013 the recent trend is towards larger facilities. [\u2026] GMV calculates that, from this set of 44 sites alone, the surface area of secure facilities in Xinjiang has expanded by some 440 hectares since 2003. [\u2026] We took one of GMV\u2019s findings \u2013 the increase in building size at the facility in Dabancheng \u2013 and showed it to a team with long experience in prison design at the Australian-based Guymer Bailey Architects. Using the measurements from the satellite images they calculated that, at an absolute minimum, the facility could provide space for about 11,000 detainees. Even that minimum estimate would place it alongside some of the biggest prisons in the world.

In the mornings, they would sing together at daily flag-raising ceremonies outside the village Party office, at night they would attend classes on Xi Jinping\u2019s vision for a \u201cNew China.\u201d The teaching of \u201cculture\u201d would suffuse all the time in between. They would converse in Mandarin and watch approved TV, practice Chinese calligraphy, and sing patriotic songs. And all the while the \u201crelatives\u201d would be watching the villagers and taking notes, assessing the Uighurs\u2019 level of loyalty to their country, noting how well they spoke Chinese, staying alert for signs that their attachment to Islam might be \u201cextreme.\u201d Had a Uighur host just greeted a neighbor in Arabic with the words \u201cAssalamu Alaykum\u201d? That would need to go in the notebook. Was that a copy of the Quran in the home? Was anyone praying on Friday or fasting during Ramadan? Was a little sister\u2019s dress too long or a little brother\u2019s beard irregular? And why was no one playing cards or watching movies? [\u2026] The \u201crelatives\u201d have been essentially conscripted into service in three separate waves. The first campaign started in 2014, dispatching some 200,000 Party members, including minority Party members, to \u201cVisit the People, Benefit the People, and Bring Together the Hearts of the People\u201d (fang minqing, hui minsheng, ju minxin, \u8bbf\u6c11\u60c5\u3001\u60e0\u6c11\u751f\u3001\u805a\u6c11\u5fc3)\u2014through long-term stays in Uighur villages. In 2016, a second wave of 110,000 civil servants were sent into Uighur villages as part of a \u201cUnited as One Family\u201d (jie dui renqin, \u7ed3\u5bf9\u8ba4\u4eb2) campaign which focused on placing \u201crelatives\u201d in the homes of Uighurs whose family members had been imprisoned or killed by the police. [Source]<\/p> <p>The systemic persecution of Uyghur intellectuals in Xinjiang has been documented in SAR\u2019s Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. It illustrates how Uyghur scholars and students have become primary targets of the Chinese state under the current crackdown. From the Uyghur Human Rights Project:<\/p> <p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has frequently targeted Uyghur academics, students, and artists, including noted scholar Ilham Tohti, in a bid to silence dissenting views to repressive state policies. However, the latest persecution of intellectuals represents a significant escalation of ethnic suppression, as even Uyghurs loyal to the state and party are now subject to absurd allegations, such as harboring separatist tendencies, and labeled as \u201ctwo-faced.\u201d Those disappeared and believed to be held in the camps include Rahile Dawut, an internationally known folklorist, literature professors Abdukerim Rahman, Azat Sultan and Gheyretjan Osman, language professor Arslan Abdulla and poet Abdulqadir Jalaleddin. High ranking university administrators such as Kashgar University\u2019s president Erkin Omer and vice president Muhter Abdughopur have been removed from their posts and their whereabouts are unknown, while others such as Halmurat Ghopur, former president of Xinjiang Medical University Hospital and former president of Xinjiang University Tashpolat Tiyip have received suspended death sentences. Other prominent figures have already died in the camps, including the religious scholars Muhammad Salih Hajim and Abdulnehed Mehsum. The disappearances of Uyghur intellectuals belie the Chinese government\u2019s assertions that the \u201cre-education\u201d campaign is an effort to de-radicalize the population and combat terrorism. Instead it is part of a coordinated effort to undermine and eliminate a distinct Uyghur identity as rapidly as possible in an unprecedentedly aggressive forced assimilation campaign. UHRP calls on the government of China to immediately release all scholars, writers, artists, and students arbitrarily detained and at risk of harsh mistreatment, including torture. UHRP urges governments and academic institutions around the world to vigorously press the Chinese government for information about the whereabouts and well-being of disappeared and detained academics and intellectuals.

They received phone calls from people in Chicago and Minneapolis informing them the FBI was raiding their homes. Burke thought the FBI might raid his house. He decided his daughter needed to get to kindergarten before the FBI entered his home. He left with his daughter.<\/p> <p>The next thing Burke did was write a press release. He took his computer, got in his car to go find a \u201cweb cafe.\u201d New to Grand Rapids, Michigan, he had little idea where to drive. He took two left turns and noticed a car behind him took two left turns too. It didn\u2019t seem right to Burke. He took another left turn, and the car behind him also took a left turn too.<\/p> <p>Burke decided the FBI was following them. He called his wife, and they agreed he should drive to the parking garage at her work. As Burke reached the parking garage, the car that had followed him sped off. An SUV sped into the road right behind him and followed him into the garage. Burke was served with a subpoena to appear before a grand jury. His wife was later served with a subpoena too.<\/p> <p>\u201cAn agent said you\u2019re being investigated for \u2018material support to a terrorist organization\u2019 and specifically it said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),\u201d recalled Burke. \u201cMyself, I\u2019ve been the spokesman for the National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, where we protested outside the trial in Washington, D.C., of a Colombian revolutionary and one of dozens of FARC leaders who was put on trial. We don\u2019t think he should have been put on trial in this country at all. We think they are angry at us for doing political organizing and exercising our right to free speech.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burke told the story of Ricardo Palmera saying he was a professor born into a wealthy family in Colombia. He attended the naval academy. In the 1960s, just before graduation, he decided to become a professor. Palmera chose to become a social activist and work to change Colombia so peasants in his country would no longer be violently exploited and oppressed. Soon friends were being tortured.<\/p> <p>The following decade Palmera \u201cfound that almost all his friends except for one of the founders of a group called Citizen Action, [a woman], were dead.\u201d Military and death squads killed them in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Palmera thought he had a choice between becoming a refugee and joining the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia. He fought as a member of the Patriotic Union.<\/p> <p>Palmera was captured by the Colombian government, seized in Ecuadorm and extradited to the U.S. in 2004. The U.S. government put him on trial. The first trial, according to Burke, was a \u201cterrorist trial that led to a hung jury.\u201d During the second one, \u201cFederal Judge Hogan was found cheating with a U.S. prosecutor and had to step down.\u201d<\/p> <p>The jury could not find Palmera guilty of \u201cterrorism,\u201d but they did find him guilty of \u201cbelonging to the FARC\u201d and so he was charged, mostly because he was found to have been involved in the kidnapping of three U.S. military contractors.<\/p> <p>\u201cThat charge should have carried only a 7-year maximum sentence, but the judge gave him sixty years,\u201d explained Burke. He is now in solitary confinement in a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, \u201cbeing held as a political prisoner.\u201d<\/p> <p>The FARC are, according to the National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, an \u201cindependent peasants\u2019 movement.\u201d A description of the FARC on the Committee\u2019s website claims \u201cone third\u201d of FARC fighters are women.<\/p> <p>But the U.S., which has forces intervening in the conflict in Colombia, considers the FARC to be terrorists, not a recognized military force at war with the military force backed by the Colombian government. This means the capturing of U.S. contractors, while FARC argues this was simply an act of taking prisoners of war, was regarded as something \u201cagainst the law of all civilized nations.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to his profile on the Committee to Stop FBI Repression\u2019s website, Burke has most recently been \u201ca stay home dad of a five-year old daughter. Tom grew up in the blue-collar suburbs of Chicago and received degrees from both the University of Illinois-Champaign-Urbana and the University of Illinois-Chicago. He then worked as a school custodian and building engineer in the Oak Park schools for 14 years, where he won an Illinois State award for service. Tom Burke was a union steward, union organizer, and elected to the Executive Board of Local 73, Service Employees International Union with 23,000 members.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burke shared how he and his wife have been active since the days when college students protested apartheid. He notes President Obama was part of that movement and supported Nelson Mandela, \u201cwho until three years ago was still on the U.S. terrorist list.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re proud that we were part of that successful movement to end apartheid. And we continue to be active around international solidarity. And so when were subpoenaed, we were shocked,\u201d said Burke. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the U.S. should have political police with the FBI, who are serving an agenda of building a U.S. empire. Activists like ourselves have a right to organize, a right to free speech, to speak out, to not have our houses searched, to not have our government demand our computers, our cell phones. We also think we have a right to not speak at a secret trial.\u201d<\/p> <p>A grand jury is not like trials most Americans have seen play out. Burke addressed how a grand jury works.<\/p> <p>\u201cAs an activist or any citizen, your called to face a grand jury where there\u2019s no judge in the proceedings. There\u2019s only the U.S. prosecutor. It\u2019s like a preemptive trial. So, the US prosecutor gets to pick the twenty-three jurors. There\u2019s no one from your side in the room.\u201d [For more info, read this post put together by a blogger at Firedoglake.]<\/p> <p>The U.S. prosecutor guides the twenty-three through the process. Those jurors tend to want to help and identify with the prosecutor. When you enter the room, your lawyer is not allowed to be with you. You have to excuse yourself and go to the hallway to talk to your lawyer. The media is not allowed to watch it and you can\u2019t have your family or friends in the room to support you either. All of that, and more, is why Burke and his wife decided to never cooperate with the grand jury.<\/p> <p>Finally, Burke emphasized, \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing solidarity work with people in other countries who get killed for doing what they do. When I went to Colombia in 2003, a labor union delegation my union local SEIU, at that time three Colombian trade unionists were being killed every single week. And that was the scariest week of my life.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burke was with the human rights director of the oil workers union, and all week he had to have armed security and know who was with the group and whether they were in a safe place.<\/p> <p>\u201cEvery week, a Colombian trade unionist gets killed,\u201d Burke declared.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3H6W48L9F64SRVSCS8VW7NZRT0CPW3"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":502,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2004.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Ecuador","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tom Burke","victim_keywords":"FARC, PFLP, advocate, National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, FBI, 2010","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ricardo Palmera","victim_keywords":"Columbia, social activist, FARC, Ecuador, extradition, 2004","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Columbia, trade union, workers, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2004.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Ecuador","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tom Burke","victim_keywords":"FARC, PFLP, advocate, National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera, FBI, 2010","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ricardo Palmera","victim_keywords":"Columbia, social activist, FARC, Ecuador, extradition, 2004","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Columbia, trade union, workers, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":934764288,"Input.title":"Things to know: Malaysiakini and what its case means for press freedom","Input.publish_date":"2020-07-13 08:27:42","Input.article_interface":"<p>Malaysiakini and editor-in-chief Steven Gan, who could face imprisonment if found guilty of contempt of court, await the Malaysian Federal Court's judgment<\/p> <p>MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Malaysian Federal Court concluded the hearing on the contempt of court case against online news portal Malaysiakini and its editor-in-chief Steven Gan on Monday, July 13.<\/p> <p>The 7-member federal court panel reserved its judgment for another day that is yet to be set.

November 16, 2020. Sergey Gapon \/ AFP \/ Scanpix \/ LETA<\/p> <p>On Sunday, Moldova held a second round of voting in its 2020 presidential elections. Opposition candidate Maia Sandu won, becoming the first woman president in the country\u2019s history. Sandu defeated the incumbent head of state, Igor Dodon, who is often referred to as one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s main supporters in the former USSR. Sandu, on the other hand, is considered a pro-EU, anti-corruption candidate .<\/p> <p>A six-week war in Nagorno-Karabakh has ended disastrously for Armenia. Judging by the map, the situation on the ground will revert mostly to the conditions in place before Yerevan\u2019s 1991 war with Baku, leaving Azerbaijani artillery perched just outside the breakaway republic\u2019s capital city and the 50,000 souls who call it home. The big difference this time around is the presence of Russian peacekeepers \u2014 about 2,000 of them \u2014 who will be there to monitor a Kremlin-brokered truce. Not formally part of the trilateral settlement but still very much involved in the conflict is Turkey, which is expected to field its own monitors in Azerbaijan, albeit outside the Karabakh region.<\/p> <p>For a better understanding of the violence that took place in this area since late September, and to explore what it means to have won or lost in this war, \u201cThe Naked Pravda\u201d turned to three experts: Neil Hauer (a Canadian journalist based in the Caucasus who\u2019s reported extensively on conflicts in Georgia, Syria, and Nagorno-Karabakh), Richard Giragosian (the director of the Regional Studies Center, an independent think tank based in Armenia), and Rob Lee (a former Marine engineer officer and a current doctoral student at King\u2019s College London).<\/p> <p>Opinion and analysis<\/p> <p>In an op-ed for Republic, columnist and former diplomat Vladimir Frolov makes a spirited defense of Russia\u2019s actions in Nagorno-Karabakh, swatting away criticisms from Western analysts, Russia\u2019s opposition, and Kremlin loyalists who argue that Moscow emboldened its enemies and betrayed its \u201cChristian allies.\u201d Frolov describes the trilateral settlement announced on November 10 as compatible with Russia\u2019s new \u201cstrategic restraint\u201d (see Meduza\u2019s October 29, 2020, newsletter), explaining that the peacekeeping contingent deployed to Azerbaijan is a relatively small risk for big rewards (ending the bloodshed, blocking France and America without shutting them out of the peace process entirely, and bolstering Russian influence in the South Caucasus). Frolov also emphasizes that the Kremlin carefully avoided overcommitting in the region, aware that there\u2019s little public support for a major intervention.<\/p> <p>At the same time, Frolov acknowledges that Putin pledged and deployed troops to Karabakh on flimsy legal grounds, using the Federation Council\u2019s permission for Russian intervention in Syria as a free pass to send troops anywhere at any future time. The status of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region itself, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t been resolved, and Yerevan, Baku, and Moscow all apparently expect different things here, ranging from the fantasy of independence, the lands\u2019 total Azerbaijani subjugation, and a multiconfessional hodgepodge guarded indefinitely by Russian peacekeepers.<\/p> <p>For the foreseeable future, Armenian sovereignty has been reduced to something like Abkhazia\u2019s, says Frolov, who also argues that Moscow doesn\u2019t want to see Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan ousted in another coup and replaced with hardliners who would seek to undo \u201cPutin\u2019s Plan\u201d in Karabakh by restarting the war. Despite vitriol in the media about Pashinyan belonging to George Soros, he\u2019s now beholden to Vladimir Putin more than anyone, for his political future and perhaps his very life, Frolov says.<\/p> <p>In an op-ed for Novaya Gazeta, deputy chief editor Andrey Lipsky says there\u2019s a chance for improved U.S.-Russian relations with President Biden, though Moscow can expect the return of traditional Democratic (big \u201cD\u201d) rhetoric on human rights. Joe Biden is also more committed to Eastern Europe\u2019s struggles against Russian influence, which will restore some of America\u2019s interest in Ukraine and the Baltic states, for example.<\/p> <p>When it comes to sanctions, Washington may have exhausted all its options, short of a mutually painful escalation that might be justifiable only if Russia continues its bad behavior internationally.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, a breakthrough could be possible in arms control negotiations, which diplomats could perhaps build on to reach talks on cyber-defense. A cyber treaty could go a long way, argues Lipsky, to normalizing bilateral relations and boosting the role of experts in a field overcrowded by \u201cpropagandists and hawks.\u201d<\/p> <p>In an article for Mediazona, journalist Maxim Litavrin catalogs the largely undocumented spread of coronavirus through Russia\u2019s Federal Penitentiary Service , which has been extremely reluctant to release data to the public or confirm outside reports of infections. For this information, Litavrin relies on members of public monitoring commissions who visit prisons to speak to inmates and observe living conditions, as well as other human rights activists, journalists, and inmates\u2019 lawyers and relatives.<\/p> <p>In a pattern that repeats across the country, Russia\u2019s prison officials have apparently avoided diagnosing likely COVID-19 cases, left prisoners to handle the illness on their own, and refused to disclose test results. Since the start of the pandemic, Russia\u2019s Federal Penitentiary Service has acknowledged only about 1,600 coronavirus infections, including just a single, solitary death. (For comparison, at the time of this writing, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has recorded 3,336 COVID-19 cases and 140 deaths among inmates.)<\/p> <p>Historian Alexander Abalov and economist Vladimir Inozemtsev have a new book which they vow is built on \u201chistorical facts and the logic of state development,\u201d according to Republic. An excerpt published online makes it apparent that Abalov and Inozemtsev embrace a grand view of \u201cfacts and logic.\u201d In the text available at Republic, the two authors argue that Russian elites have \u201cMuscovized\u201d the country\u2019s post-Soviet development by trying to resurrect the most stagnating, repressive aspects of Russia\u2019s imperial past , which lack even the great ambitions of peak imperialism in the Tsarist and Soviet eras.<\/p> <p>Abalov and Inozemtsev say Russia\u2019s post-Soviet leaders have abandoned the USSR\u2019s late emphasis on human capital as the driver of economic progress and shifted their focus to sectors that could be consolidated in the state\u2019s hands and controlled with the minimal involvement of most society. All states extract and redistribute rents, Abalov and Inozemtsev admit, but these actions by Russia\u2019s modern-day petrostate are conducted chiefly to serve the elites\u2019 material interests rather than improve the public good. The justifications offered for this process, the authors claim, are \u201cirrational\u201d ideas about \u201cnational expediency.\u201d<\/p> <p>In their assessment of Russia\u2019s post-Soviet trajectory, Abalov and Inozemtsev settle on a version of path dependency, arguing that the elites\u2019 efforts to revive Muscovite and Russian imperial practices were both \u201cquite natural and apparently inevitable,\u201d as well as the result of a variety of factors, ranging from popular expectations, elites\u2019 commercial interests, and objective economic trends, which they say makes it wrong to attribute the imperialist revival to a few random personal factors. If this turn was predetermined, however, Russia\u2019s future is up for grabs, they say. Moscow lacks the strength economically and socially to serve as the post-imperial consolidation point it wants to be, meaning that Russia\u2019s current economic system isn\u2019t a post-Soviet endpoint. In other words, another major destabilization with unpredictable results lies ahead.<\/p> <p>Other news in brief<\/p> <p> Suing Putin\u2019s mouth.

Mongolia\u2019s officials insisted then, in 2016, that the visit was strictly religious, and had nothing to do with politics: The country has connections to Tibetan Buddhism that reach back hundreds of years\u2014the title \u201cDalai Lama\u201d is actually of Mongolian origin. Of course, that mattered little to China, which views the octogenarian spiritual leader as a separatist.<\/p> <p>Beijing promptly canceled meetings with its Mongolian counterparts and slapped fees on commodity imports from Mongolia, which was already suffering from an economic downturn. A month later, the Mongolian government said the Dalai Lama was no longer welcome. He has not returned since.<\/p> <p>Tsakhia Elbegdorj, Mongolia\u2019s president at the time, told me recently that the decision was, as was widely assumed, due to \u201cpressure from the south,\u201d a reference to China, with which Mongolia shares a border. Elbegdorj has an outsize role in modern Mongolian politics: He served two terms as the country\u2019s president, from 2009 to 2017, and prior to that, two terms as prime minister. He was one of the leaders of the 1990 democratic revolution that peacefully ended seven decades of Mongolia\u2019s serving as a Soviet satellite state. Given his country\u2019s location, hemmed in by Russia and China\u2014two countries that \u201creally don\u2019t like our way of life,\u201d as Elbegdorj put it\u2014and its economic dependence on Beijing, he has spent much of his political life interacting with the highest levels of the Chinese government. By his count, he has met Chinese President Xi Jinping some 30 times. In 2015, Xi hailed China-Mongolia relations as the \u201cbest ever.\u201d<\/p> <p>Now a harsh and high-profile critic of Beijing\u2019s recent efforts to stamp out the Mongolian language and its distinctive, vertical script in Inner Mongolia, an ostensibly autonomous region within China that is distinct from Mongolia, Elbegdorj and his country offer an extreme example of the difficulties facing nations that are heavily reliant on Beijing. Those challenges are amplified for places such as Mongolia\u2014democracies that profess even limited support for human rights. China\u2019s economic and military power allow it to demand uncomfortable concessions, and as the country becomes more and more antagonistic, its less powerful neighbors are left with little room for maneuver. How, then, does a smaller nation choose between its values and its interests?<\/p> <p>\u201cOf course, when you are in office, you have certain responsibilities,\u201d Elbegdorj told me in one of two recent interviews, struggling at times to square his current vocal denunciations of Chinese policies with his more muted tone when he occupied the highest echelons of government. \u201cBut when you are out of office, you also have more freedom to express your ideas.\u201d When I asked him whether he still believed, as his foreign minister said four years ago, that the Dalai Lama should be barred from visiting, he was briefly evasive, before relenting, \u201cI\u2019ll say it publicly now: We are always happy to see his holiness in Mongolia.\u201d<\/p> <p>When Elbegdorj, a journalist turned democracy advocate, became president in 2009, the country was becoming one of superlatives. It was, briefly, the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, powered largely by mineral wealth, housing the world\u2019s best-performing stock exchange, located in what is often referred to as the coldest capital city in the world. Prospectors, geologists, heavy-equipment operators, and a stream of carpetbaggers of all varieties arrived from Australia, the U.S., and Europe. The boom brought flashes of wealth to Soviet-influenced Ulaanbaatar: Ostentatiously kitted out Hummers idled in traffic, inching past the softly lit glass front of a Louis Vuitton store. The city\u2019s last statue of Vladimir Lenin came down in 2012. (The boom would prove short-lived\u2014by 2017, the country needed a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.)<\/p> <p>While he upgraded relations with China, Elbegdorj also worked to bring Mongolia to a more prominent position on the international stage, involving it more heavily in the United Nations and other multinational groups. (He had a moment of viral stardom when former President Barack Obama inadvertently obscured his face during a 2011 photo op.) He pushed for the abolition of the death penalty, which, when it occurred in 2015, brought praise from human-rights groups. President-elect Joe Biden in 2011 hailed Mongolia under Elbegdorj as an \u201cemerging leader in the worldwide democratic movement.\u201d The enthusiasm was tempered a year later, though, when Elbegdorj faced U.S. and UN criticism for the jailing of a former president.<\/p> <p>But praise from the West for democratic progress cannot make up for uncomfortable geography. \u201cMongolia\u2019s strong economic dependence on China is worrisome,\u201d Oyunsuren Damdinsuren, a senior lecturer at the National University of Mongolia\u2019s School of International Relations and Public Administration, told me. \u201cIf China decides not to buy Mongolian products, our economy will be paralyzed.\u201d This power imbalance has helped fuel broad anti-Chinese sentiment among Mongolia\u2019s population, aided by a history of \u201c200 years of Manchu rule, 70 years of anti-China communist propaganda, and 30 years of China-bashing electoral campaigns,\u201d Damdinsuren said.<\/p> <p>Read: What happens when China leads the world<\/p> <p>The Dalai Lama\u2019s visit was not Elbegdorj\u2019s first, or only, China-related controversy. Two years earlier, in 2014, his country\u2019s officials stopped two Mongol-rights advocates from Inner Mongolia who had made their way across the border and were reportedly seeking exile. The pair were sent back to China, and what has happened to them since is unclear. Elbegdorj took both domestic and foreign criticism for the move at the time, and, indeed, still does. He now calls the incident an \u201cunfortunate mistake,\u201d but claims that the decision was made without his input. He added that Mongolia\u2019s current government, led by a populist political rival, should take a stronger stand and allow Inner Mongolians to seek refuge. \u201cI\u2019m openly saying to our government, \u2018Don\u2019t give those people back to China,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cThey should be granted refugee status.\u201d<\/p> <p>Unbounded by elected office, in recent months Elbegdorj has emerged as one of the most consistent and highest-profile critics of Beijing\u2019s attempts to curb Mongolian language and culture both within its own borders and internationally. During our conversations, he repeatedly said that his outspokenness was not caused by a sudden shift in his thinking\u2014though he acknowledged that there is a distinct challenge in the diplomatic balancing act required to run a country so dependent on China.<\/p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t change,\u201d he said when pressed on these seeming contradictions. \u201cMy standing\u2014to keep and continue to protect Mongolian identity, language, culture, and script\u2014since I entered public life, it remains the same.\u201d Rather, he told me, \u201cthe Chinese actually changed,\u201d and he noted what he called a \u201cvery aggressive\u201d assimilation policy being undertaken by the authorities in Inner Mongolia.<\/p> <p>Young women in Mongolian ceremonial clothing watched over by Chinese police at opening ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. (James Whitlow Delano \/ Redux)<\/p> <p>The full scope of these efforts came to light in September, when China started transitioning students in Inner Mongolia to using state-compiled textbooks and changing the language of lessons from Mongolian to Mandarin Chinese. The situation drew speculation that the Mongols of Inner Mongolia would soon be treated like minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, two regions where China has gone to extraordinary lengths to assimilate ethnic Tibetan and Uighur populations with the national Han Chinese majority.<\/p> <p>Beijing has responded to criticism of its Inner Mongolia policy with predictable furor. Chinese officials have singled out Elbegdorj, deploying a familiar tactic of accusing him of meddling in its internal affairs. He disagrees with the assessment. \u201cThis is not a foreign issue,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt is an issue related with my language; it is an issue related with my culture; it is an issue related with my tradition. Mongolians who live in Inner Mongolia, Mongolians who live in Mongolia, they are the same people, the same blood, the same traditions, the same history.\u201d (Elbegdorj\u2019s activism has, so far, been confined to Mongolia, a decision over which he has little say: He is facing a corruption probe and has been barred from leaving the country for the past few months, he told me. He denies the charges and said the investigation was politically motivated.)<\/p> <p>Read: The end of Hong Kong<\/p> <p>Mongols make up about 17 percent of the population of Inner Mongolia. The group has sometimes been described as a \u201cmodel minority\u201d within China. Though notable flare-ups have occurred, Mongolian nationalists have not been as openly radical as Uighurs and Tibetans, and Beijing\u2019s repression there is not nearly as severe as in Xinjiang or Tibet, according to Christopher P. Atwood, a professor of East Asian languages and civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. Society and culture within Inner Mongolia \u201cremains \u2018legible\u2019 to Han Chinese in a way that Uyghur and Tibetan society and culture, seen through the lenses of Islamophobia and secularist discourses about \u2018primitive superstition\u2019, has not been,\u201d Atwood recently wrote.<\/p> <p>Beijing has also generally taken a soft approach to Mongolia, never muscling in, for example, on a major mining project. Julian Dierkes, an associate public-policy professor at the University of British Columbia who is an expert on Mongolia, has long argued that this dynamic is due in part to nervousness about China\u2019s sizable domestic Mongolian community and the potential for ethnic conflict. There \u201chas always been this implicit concern or threat around having a large minority population that actually has a country outside to which it refers, unlike Uighurs and unlike Tibetans,\u201d he told me. Elbegdorj similarly described the Mongols of Inner Mongolia as a \u201cliving wall\u201d protecting Mongolia from China.<\/p> <p>These factors made it more alarming when, in July, initial reports of the education reforms began to surface. As the start of a new school year drew near, petitions against the move circulated on Chinese social media, and a number of popular bands backed calls for the decision to be reversed. Students and their parents staged large protests. China\u2019s response was swift: According to human-rights groups, the authorities carried out numerous arrests, harassed journalists, censored social media, and sacked academics who spoke out.<\/p> <p>In a September letter delivered to the Chinese embassy in Ulaanbaatar and addressed to Xi, Elbegdorj opened with a stinging line: \u201cYou, perhaps, have heard and are aware of the fundamental provision in the Constitution of your country that states \u2018All nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages\u2019 which is now being flagrantly infringed upon with respect to the Mongolian children of Inner Mongolia.\u201d The Chinese ambassador was incensed, dismissing Elbegdorj\u2019s claims as baseless hype, and the letter was promptly returned. Elbegdorj told me a few weeks before we spoke that his brother had received a menacing phone call warning him that Elbegdorj should stop his advocacy and keep quiet. The call, he said, came from a Chinese phone number.<\/p> <p>China has not confined its efforts to erase Mongolian identity to its own borders. Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne, a medieval castle in Nantes, France, houses a natural-history museum that was until recently preparing to host an exhibition on the 13th-century Mongol emperor Genghis Khan, organized in collaboration with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot, China. As preparations progressed, however, Chinese officials began asking that words such as empire, Mongol, and even the name Genghis Khan be removed from the exhibit, the museum director, Bertrand Guillet, wrote in a statement. They then went further, demanding that the exhibition synopsis be rewritten by Beijing. The text that emerged was \u201caimed at making Mongolian history and culture completely disappear for the benefit of a new national story,\u201d according to Guillet. He finally postponed the exhibit, \"in the name of the human, scientific and ethical values defended by the institution.\u201d It will open at a later date but with collections from Europe and America, rather than China.<\/p> <p>Mongolian politicians have been loath to speak out, likely worried by Beijing\u2019s reaction. The power imbalance was again made clear when China\u2019s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, visited Mongolia in September and was met by protesters angry over the actions in Inner Mongolia. Neither Wang nor Mongolia\u2019s current president made any public statement on the situation. But the Chinese ambassador, in an interview with a local newspaper, noted that China\u2019s demand for Mongolia\u2019s biggest export earner, coal, was falling. The implication was clear. \u201cFrankly,\u201d he was reported as saying, \u201cwe are working in your interests.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3MXX6RQ9EXKGIT9SI2PDCVG096G4PX"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1804,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["enforced disappearance"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Inner Mongolia","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongol-rights activists","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongolian nationals, ethnic monorities, Chinese expansion","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["enforced disappearance"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Inner Mongolia","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongol-rights activists","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Mongolian nationals, ethnic monorities, Chinese expansion","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":884988798,"Input.title":"After a week in Hanoi: What we need to make a EU-Vietnam trade deal work","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-07 11:12:01","Input.article_interface":"<p>The jury is out on whether a new EU-Vietnam trade pact will do anything to improve people\u2019s livelihoods and arrest a deteriorating human rights record, writes Jude Kirton-Darling.<\/p> <p>Jude Kirton-Darling is a British MEP in the Socialists and Democrats group (S&D).<\/p> <p>Last week we learned that all the 39 people tragically found dead in a lorry in Essex were Vietnamese. The news reached me in Hanoi, where I was taking part in a European Parliament trade delegation. While MEPs are currently considering whether or not to support new comprehensive trade and investment deals with Vietnam, this horrendous story has shone a sombre light on the complex reality of our relationship with the world\u2019s 15th biggest country. A complexity based on increasing flows of investment, goods and services taking place above the table, a deteriorating human rights environment according to Amnesty and others, and human trafficking hidden within plain sight.<\/p> <p>The question before us, as MEPs set to vote on this deal in January next year, must therefore be: will this trade deal help improve people\u2019s livelihoods and rights, and offer a brighter future for Vietnamese at home? Or will it make matters worse?<\/p> <p>After an intensive and high-level trade delegation, including meetings with government, civil society, business and international organisations, I don\u2019t have a definite answer yet. Ultimately, much depends on how the Vietnamese authorities respond in action to our concerns. In the months leading up to the ratification vote in the European Parliament, they can commit Vietnam to a path of progress, which the EU will support through renewed economic and diplomatic relations. But if they choose to ignore our concerns on fundamental freedoms, human rights and sustainable development, then I struggle to see how MEPs could endorse the deals.<\/p> <p>Central to this progressive agenda are labour rights in the country. Vietnam is producing more and more for the EU market \u2013 primarily telephone sets, electronic products, footwear, textiles and clothing \u2013 with imports from the country having nearly quadrupled over the past ten years. This makes labour rights in the country all the more important for EU consumers. While it is clearly not satisfactory today, the situation in this respect could soon change for the better with the right political leadership in Vietnam.<\/p> <p>There are currently no independent trade unions in this one-party state, but a revision of the Labour Code currently being debated by the National Assembly could grant workers the right to form their own grassroots organisations, hence enacting in Vietnamese law at least in the principle of ILO convention 87. The vote on the reform by the Vietnamese National Assembly, expected later this month, could also give workers new protections such as rules to prevent companies from abusing temporary contracts. Vietnam has already given us some tangible signs of its willingness to improve the situation in this respect. ILO Convention 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining was ratified by Vietnam in July this year and will enter into force in July 2020. Whether the Labour Code reform is adopted, and crucially whether subsequent implementing legislation confirms this progressive workers\u2019 rights agenda will be key for EU parliamentarians in assessing the trade deal this winter. We will also be looking closely at whether Vietnam produces a credible roadmap towards the full ratification of ILO Convention 105 on the abolition of forced labour and ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association by 2020 and 2023, respectively.<\/p> <p>But as many organisations such as Human Rights Watch have pointed out, labour rights are not the whole story: human rights more broadly are at stake in these trade negotiations, and a positive vote from the EP should only come as a result of progress for fundamental freedoms overall. In this respect the situation is very concerning. According to several sources, there are currently over a hundred political prisoners in the country, and the number is rising. While the European Parliament delegation was in Hanoi, two online activists were sentenced to prison terms for sharing content on social media, or according to Vietnam\u2019s penal code \u201cconducting anti-state propaganda\u201d and \u201cabusing democratic freedom\u201d. The rights to free expression, association and assembly are severely curtailed. The judiciary, the press and civil society are under tight government control. Over recent years, the European Parliament has adopted several resolutions condemning Vietnam for its human rights record, and demanded concrete changes. The response from Vietnamese authorities have been unsatisfactory thus far. The most recent European Parliament resolution, in November 2018, notably called for the release of all political prisoners. Since then, only one of them was freed \u2013 but only because he had completed his prison term. The resolution also called for putting an end to the harassment of human rights defenders, lifting restrictions on religious freedom, ensuring the humane treatment for all detainees, ensuring fair trials, adopting a revision of the Penal Code and enacting a moratorium on the death penalty.<\/p> <p>One recent piece of legislation has attracted specific criticism: a new cyber security law that entered into force at the start of 2019. Actors on the ground have documented an intensified crackdown on human rights activism in the country, linked to the provisions of the new law that give the authorities licence to censor content, control information and silence online dissidents. The legislation also raises concerns for EU economic interests, including forced data localisation provisions which are at odds with the EU\u2019s liberalisation agenda in this respect. This law must be revised to be brought in line with international standards.<\/p> <p>Greater trade between the EU and Vietnam could be beneficial to people on both sides, creating jobs and lowering costs, but only if it underpins fundamental rights and better working conditions. Before we vote in the European Parliament, we need a strong signal from Vietnam that this trade deal will deliver on its sustainable development promises. This implies concrete action on labour rights, human rights and the cyber-security law. This was the message that was audible and I hope was heard in Hanoi during our visit.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3DQYSJDTYNQ3J48CTZB7FUEUOUIXEJ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"2303b84d-0115-4284-b9df-e5c53f359001","work_time_in_seconds":837,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2019","month":"11","date":"7.0","city":"None","region":"Essex","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Vietnamese, 39 people, lorry, dead","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2019","month":"11","date":"7.0","city":"None","region":"Essex","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Vietnamese, 39 people, lorry, dead","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":958384432,"Input.title":"Opinion | With a Soviet-style election, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tightens his grip on Venezuela","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-07 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Placeholder while article actions load<\/p> <p>On Sunday, many Venezuelans turned up at polling places, had their names checked against voter rolls and were then ushered to a private area, where they could choose among candidates and parties on a ballot.

That\u2019s the kind of election Venezuela held: You pick any type of politician, so long as they are pro-regime.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Then again, dictatorships have held this kind of faux elections for decades. On June 12, 1966, nearly every Soviet voter chose candidates aligned with the Communist Party. Every five years, the same charade was repeated, with the victims of the Soviet regime being allowed to choose from slates of one. In Cuba, the same cruel tradition brings people out on the streets every five years. No one mistakes these pantomimes for real elections.<\/p> <p>What\u2019s sad is that Venezuelan elections have not always been run on the Soviet model. As recently as 2015, Venezuela held a hard-fought, competitive election for control of the National Assembly, our unicameral legislature. The opposition won a resounding victory, ending up with a two-thirds supermajority in the chamber \u2014 enough even to amend the constitution.<\/p> <p>Within days of losing that election, the Maduro regime set out a strategy to effectively annul it. In a series of strained court decisions, the regime had its Supreme Court declare that the new opposition-led National Assembly was allowed to sit, but could neither pass laws nor exercise oversight functions over the government. Its only power would be to make speeches. In time, even that would be taken away.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>From that point on, Venezuela\u2019s descent from \u201chybrid regime\u201d or \u201ccompetitive authoritarianism\u201d into downright military dictatorship was swift. Police death squads have murdered thousands of people in recent years, particularly young men in poor areas. International human rights groups began to compile thick files substantiating reports of torture, arbitrary arrest and extrajudicial executions. Opposition political figures have been harassed, beaten, jailed and forced into exile in ever-growing numbers.<\/p> <p>In 2019, what remained of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-led legislature designated its president, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the legitimate president of the country. It was an act of desperation \u2014 a constitutional Hail Mary pass. With support from foreign governments, the Trump administration first among them, Guaid\u00f3 hoped to turn enough army officers against the regime to destabilize it.<\/p> <p>That gambit failed. Its failure has left the opposition at a loss. With all institutional avenues for contesting the regime\u2019s power closed and the regime adopting KGB-style tactics to stay in power, talk of transitions and political negotiations ring increasingly hollow.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Now the awful truth is that beginning in January, Maduro will have his own fully controlled legislature in place. Once that happens, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s already threadbare claim on power will look entirely absurd. The opposition\u2019s protestations have long been barren, and with each passing day they look worse than that \u2014 simply divorced from reality.<\/p> <p>Today, Maduro\u2019s dictatorship is thoroughly consolidated. Our moral revulsion at this fact does nothing to make it less of a fact. Having spent all of my adult life fighting any way I could find against the imposition of dictatorship in Venezuela, it hurts almost physically to write this. But facts are facts, and little good can come from denying them.<\/p> <p>President-elect Joe Biden would do well to build a Venezuela policy based on a cold assessment of this intolerable fact, and not on the self-defeating fantasies the Trump administration has put at the center of its approach.<\/p> <p>Read more:<\/p> <p>GiftOutline Gift Article<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3D17ECOUOGASJ57MXM941U6WSOA31Z"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":532,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2015.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Venezuela","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civilians, citizens, Venezuela","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2015.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Venezuela","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civilians, citizens, Venezuela","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1041894477,"Input.title":"EXCLUSIVE: What I know about Umaru Dikko\u2019s failed abduction in London \u2013 Ex-diplomat","Input.publish_date":"2022-04-29 15:13:18","Input.article_interface":"<p>Haldu Hananiya, a former Nigerian ambassador to the United Kingdom, has given some insider\u2019s insights into the failed attempt by then Muhammadu Buhari-led military regime to abduct an exiled Nigerian Second Republic minister, Umaru Dikko, in London.<\/p> <p>Mr Hananiya, a retired army general, now 80, shared his thoughts about the incident in his yet-to-be-released book, \u2018All Eyes On Me,\u2019 a copy of which was exclusively obtained by PREMIUM TIMES.<\/p> <p>The book is a memoir, reflecting on the life and career of Mr Hananiya.

Police have arrested hundreds of people for participating in actions in support of the victimized TSRTC workers.<\/p> <p>In 2015, the Telangana High Court quickly declared a TSRTC strike illegal, helping the TRS government break it. Fearing that the current clash between the government and the transport workers could become the catalyst for a broader working class upsurge, the High Court has, thus far, been far more circumspect. Some two weeks into the strike, the court declared it would hold in abeyance a ruling on the strike\u2019s legality, admonished both the government and unions, and instructed the government to return to the bargaining table.<\/p> <p>A call to make the defence of the victimized TSRTC workers the spearhead of a working class counter-offensive against privatization and the casualization of work would resonate across India, since all workers, including transport workers in other states, teachers, coal miners, and those employed by Indian\u2019s globally connected automakers, are facing similar attacks.<\/p> <p>Instead, the unions and the Stalinist parliamentary parties, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM, are doing everything in their power to quarantine the TSRTC workers\u2019 militant struggle, and to encourage them to put their trust in the High Court and the maneuvers of Telangana\u2019s opposition parties. This includes the Congress, the party that long spearheaded the ruling elite\u2019s push to make India a cheap-labor haven for transnational corporations and a \u201cglobal strategic partner\u201d of US imperialism, and India\u2019s current governing party, the Hindu supremacist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).<\/p> <p>As KCR and his cabinet were plotting the escalation of their all-out assault on the TSRTC workers Saturday, the leaders of JAC were meeting with opposition party representatives, including leaders of BJP\u2019s state unit and the CPI.<\/p> <p>Following this meeting and while the TRS cabinet meeting remained in session, JAC Convener E. Ashwathama Reddy told a press conference, \u201cWhatever announcement comes [out of the cabinet meeting], [workers] should not worry. The strike will continue.\u201d<\/p> <p>In fact Reddy\u2019s remarks were a devastating self-indictment of the JAC, and underscore the urgency of the TSRTC workers taking the leadership of their struggle out of the hands of the pro-capitalist unions.<\/p> <p>The JAC convenor announced that the unions will request a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s right-hand man, Amit Shah. \u201cWe will meet Home Minister Amit Shah,\u201d said Reddy,\u201d and explain the situation and request him to look into it.\u201d<\/p> <p>Shah is an inveterate enemy of the working class, who has been an accomplice in all Modi\u2019s crimes, including as Gujarat state chief minister, Modi instigated the 2002 Gujarat anti-Muslim pogrom. A Hindu supremacist demagogue, Shah has repeatedly described poverty-stricken Bangladesh migrants as \u201ctermites,\u201d while promising to extend the National Citizens Register, under which two million Muslims in the north-eastern state of Assam have been targeted for deportation, across India.<\/p> <p>Modi\u2019s and Shah\u2019s whipping of communal reaction is aimed at intimidating and splitting the working class, so as to press forward with the imposition of pro-investor policies. In recent weeks, the BJP government has dramatically cut corporate taxes, accelerated its privatization drive, raised or entirely lifted foreign investment caps, and funneled vast sums that could have been used to meet crying social needs to the country\u2019s ailing banks.<\/p> <p>In moving to privatize the TSRTC, KCR and the Telangana state government are in fact only following the policy advocated by Shah\u2019s cabinet colleague Nitin Gadkari, the minister of road transport and highways. Earlier this year, Gadkari publicly exhorted India\u2019s state governments to privatize public transport since according to him it is an intolerable drain on the exchequer. No matter that for hundreds of millions of Indians relatively inexpensive public road transport is an essential service for commuting to work or school and for long-distance travel.<\/p> <p>Faced with mounting social opposition, capitalist ruling elites from France and Spain to Chile and Ecuador are turning to violent repression. Undoubtedly, KCR has been emboldened in his assault on the TSRTC workers by the strong support big business, the courts, and the political establishment have given to Modi and Shah in their illegal abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s semi-autonomous status and imposition of a three-month state-of-siege on a region that is home to more than 12 million people.<\/p> <p>Speaking to the press at the conclusion of Saturday\u2019s TRS cabinet meeting, KCR railed against the striking workers. He again ruled out any negotiations on the workers\u2019 principal demand: that the TSRTC, a state government-owned agency run on for-profit principles, be fused with the state government, so as to provide increased job protection and better benefits.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t return to work by 5 November midnight, we will privatise the remaining 5,000 routes,\u201d declared Telangana\u2019s chief minister.<\/p> <p>For years, the TRS government has deliberately run the state-owned bus company into the ground, starving it of funds, so as to provide a pretext for its privatization.<\/p> <p>Yet, in a statement that points to the price hikes and services cut that will accompany privatization, KCR said it was necessary to hand over almost half of the company\u2019s routes to private bus companies so as to provide them a \u201clevel-playing field.\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t explain why it is the duty of an elected state government to create conditions for private bus operators to profiteer off the public.<\/p> <p>Currently, the TSRTC plies some 10,400 routes in Telangana and neighboring states. Out of these, 5,100 routes are to be handed over to private companies in lieu of upgrading the dilapidated TSRTC bus fleet.<\/p> <p>The TSRTC workers have shown great courage in defying the government\u2019s threats and attempt to starve them into submission. The strike is further testament to the growing radicalization of the working class in India and internationally. Only a few years ago, many of the TSRTC workers were misled by the unions and the Stalinist parties into supporting the agitation for a separate Telangana state. Led by KCR and his TRS, the Telangana separatist movement exploited popular anger over unemployment and other social issues to advance the reactionary and divisive demand of the Telangana elite for its own regional state apparatus.<\/p> <p>According to the Hindu Business Line, the JAC held a further meeting Sunday with the purported purpose of gauging the current mood of the workers. There have been some reports that a few of the workers have trickled back to work. In so far as this is true, it is because they have been worn down by the trade unions and Stalinist parties refusal to fight to mobilize the wider working class in an uncompromising industrial and political offensive against the right-wing KCR government and against the BJP regime in New Delhi that stands behind it.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"32PT7WK7DOUMB0NYDFTZ2W75HLDD3Z"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":422,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2019.0","month":"10","date":"5.0","city":"None","region":"Telangana","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) workers, strike, union","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2019.0","month":"10","date":"5.0","city":"None","region":"Telangana","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) workers, strike, union","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":888962756,"Input.title":"Pair facing trio of charges after kidnapping woman","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-25 17:44:30.095000","Input.article_interface":"<p>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas \u2014 A man and a woman have been charged with aggravated kidnapping, retaliation, and evading arrest after a woman was able to escape their kidnap attempt on Sunday evening.<\/p> <p>Anthony Montez, 51, and 43-year-old Erica Lopez were arrested Sunday after a woman in her 30s was able to alert the staff at the Flour Bluff Walmart that she had been kidnapped.<\/p> <p>\"She was writing little notes and giving them to employees to call the police that she was kidnapped,\" Lt.

Mosteller, and deputy South Dakota Marshal Stephen Houghtaling are set to go to trial on September 13 over their roles in overseeing \u2014 or allowing \u2014 a deputy to remove prisoners from Judge Kornmann's courtroom following a spat over vaccination status of the marshal.<\/p> <p>\"When you move someone against their will, that's kidnapping,\" said Kornmann. \"I don't care who you are.\"<\/p> <p>The judge then ordered acting U.S. Attorney for South Dakota Dennis R. Holmes to decide by this Friday, June 18 at 5 p.m. whether his office will prosecute the three federal law enforcement employees.<\/p> <p>The proceedings ensued one month after a deputy marshal absconded with three criminal defendants from the federal courthouse in Aberdeen after she'd refused to answer Judge Kornmann's question of whether she'd been vaccinated or not against COVID-19. After Kornmann ordered her out of the courtroom, citing danger to the criminal defendants, the deputy and other marshals vacated the courthouse with three defendants in their custody, delaying that day and the next's scheduled hearings.<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>\"Nothing like this has ever been done in this country,\" bellowed Kornmann on Monday, June 14 at the morning hearing. \"This was such a most outrageous thing to do.\"<\/p> <p>It's not immediately clear whether Judge Kornmann will preside over the contempt hearing, as he noted he'd not been \"personally disrespected\" by the marshals' words, though he also referred to the deputy's behavior as \"contemptuous.\" The two attorneys dispatched from the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. \u2014 Joshua Gardner and Leah Taylor \u2014 said they could say little, as they worked for DOJ's civil, not criminal, division. Kornmann asked if either had ever prosecuted a criminal case before, and they both said no.<\/p> <p>The judge originally signaled he'd press civil charges of contempt but then backtracked and applied criminal after Gardner and Taylor argued civil charges were inappropriate in this matter.<\/p> <p>Still, even if criminal counsel, the two DOJ attorneys may've had little to add on Monday, as Kornmann, a Clinton-appointee and judge in Aberdeen for nearly 30 years, held-forth for the greater part of the hour, only briefly asking the attorneys whether they thought the marshals' facilities for holding defendants were adequate.<\/p> <p>\"I'm not at liberty to say,\" replied Taylor.<\/p> <p>\"No, I suppose you're not,\" replied Kornmann.<\/p> <p>While Kornmann called Kilgallon, Mosteller, and Houghtaling \"good, public servants,\" he noted that \"even good people make bad decisions.\" The three, who could face fines, or even jail time in a criminal trial, sat silently, only occasionally taking down notes.<\/p> <p>The scene was peculiar, as marshal operated a security post at the doorway to the courthouse while three of their own received notice of criminal prosecutions. According to a court filing from Kornmann last month, which contained email exchanges between the judge and USMS prior to and after the May 10 and 11 hearings, approximately only half of the marshals in South Dakota had been fully vaccinated as of last month.<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>In an April letter to Kornmann, Mosteller wrote USMS staff would not be \"providing their respective vaccination status to the Court.\"<\/p> <p>On Monday, upon clearance into the courthouse, a marshal told spectators, \"If you're vaccinated, it's your decision whether you want to wear a mask or not.\"<\/p> <p>The defense counsel and marshals charged all wore masks.

It is yet uncertain whether those attorneys will be paid for by the defendants or not. Judge Kornman offered them a way out by apologizing, admitting they were wrong, and paying $5,000 to an admitting attorneys fund for the state.<\/p> <p>\"You have dug yourself into a deep hole,\" said Kornmann, who appeared visibly angry at points and almost at a loss for words during the proceeding, adding their continued defense suggested the defendants had \"brought their own shovels\" to Monday's hearing.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3I4E7AFQ2ME4D3LK2QL1N76GG4XTJK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1239,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"May","date":null,"city":"Aberdeen","region":"South Dakota","country":"United States of America","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"prisoners, taken from courtroom, vaccinations, US Marshals","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"May","date":null,"city":"Aberdeen","region":"South Dakota","country":"United States of America","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"prisoners, taken from courtroom, vaccinations, US Marshals","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1040477521,"Input.title":"Amnesty International asks Russia to free jailed JWs","Input.publish_date":"2022-04-21 18:59:35","Input.article_interface":"<p>Five years after the Russian Supreme Court (SC) banned the organization of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (JWs) in Russia, international human rights groups continued to call for the release of at least 80 JWs detained in Russian jails.<\/p> <p>Amnesty International (AI) also called on Russia to drop criminal charges against the JW members, who have been jailed for practicing their faith.<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>Nataliya Prilutskaya, AI coordinator in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement that \u201cthose who have been subjected to criminal prosecution, torture and other ill-treatment, unlawful searches of their properties, those who have lost their jobs, must receive adequate compensation and have their rights restored.\u201d<\/p> <p>She also appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to protect the rights of 175,000 JWs in Russia in line with Russia\u2019s international human rights obligations and own constitution.<\/p> <p>According to the Office of Public Information (OPI) of JWs in Manila, Russia has imprisoned over 320 JWs\u2014with 80 still in custody\u2014raided 1,740 homes and shut down 400 legal entities and houses of worship, after the Russian SC declared the activities of JWs as \u201cextremist\u201d on April 20, 2017.<\/p> <p>Since the ban, more than 600 JWs, including 40 men and women over the age of 70, have been charged criminally for reading their own Bible at home, the OPI said.<\/p> <p>During the 2017 SC hearing, the Russian government claimed that although it was running after the legal entities of JWs, individual Witnesses would be free to practice their faith.<\/p> <p>However, the government\u2019s claim of allowing freedom to worship has been inconsistent with its actions.<\/p> <p>Valentina Baranovskaya, 70, is the oldest JW in jail, while 57-year-old Anna Safronova has received the longest prison sentence, six years.<\/p> <p>OPI said those men who were imprisoned for their faith were tortured, suffocated, stripped naked and given electric shock while Russian guards threatened to rape their wives.<\/p> <p>In a statement, Andrew Wood, former British ambassador to Russia, said: \u201cTheir arrest, ill treatment, and confinement are a breach of elementary human rights together with the infringement of the freedom of all souls to seek their path to the truths of religion as best they may.

He started his professional life by getting a job in Muslim Commercial Bank Limited<\/p> <p>He was arguably one of the strongest opponents of capitalism and feudalism. Based on his thinking and his strong commitment to the working class, in 1972, Usman was elected Central President of the Muslim Commercial Bank of Pakistan.<\/p> <p>He always fought the war of employees\u2019 interests with courage. For the rights of the employees of Muslim Commercial Bank, the efforts he put in, are unforgettable. He was first arrested in 1973 for not compromising on the rights and demands of the employees. At a time when he was addressing a protest rally in the central hall of the bank to emphasize the acquisition of profit bonuses for employees, on the behest of the bank management, the police force climbed on the stage while charging the baton and in the darkness of the night he was taken into custody and was shifted to Central Jail Karachi.<\/p> <p>Usman Ghani was not only one of the most popular leaders of Muslim Commercial Bank but also as a result of his struggle, he held a prominent position in Pakistan\u2019s banking industry\u2019s trade unions and labor movement. As well as participating in trade union activities, he was a very active leader in Pakistan\u2019s democratic politics as well.<\/p> <p>He took full part in the restoration of democracy under the leadership of Mohtarma Shaheed Benazir Bhutto and in this regard he had to endure the hardships of imprisonment. His services for democratic movement were highly valued by Mohtarma Shaheed Benazir Bhutto and she twice praised him in the general public. He was also awarded the Provincial Assembly seat in the elections. Shaheed Usman Ghani not only had to go behind the bars under the rule of military dictator and in the PML-N government, but he also endured the hardships of imprisonment even during the rule of his own party, the Pakistan People\u2019s Party. because he preferred to go to jail for the interests of the labourers, instead of compromising his principles.<\/p> <p>The last arrest of his life was made in February 1991 during Nawaz Sharif government. It came into action at a time when the CBA unions of more than 160 nationally owned entities in Pakistan were protesting against privatisation.<\/p> <p>Shaheed Usman Ghani and the writer of this article were kept in jail for many months. In the meantime, the government of the day sold the Muslim Commercial Bank to the private sector. Now the situation had changed. Despite the changed environment and the hard-working attitude of the private bank management, Usman Ghani worked very hard and patiently and restoring the fragmented time of the practical workers and restored the lost reputation of the trade union again in a very short time. He made trade unions an invincible force in bank once and for all. Usman Ghani started a new and determined era of his life but the forces hostile to the workers\u2019 movement and the democratic system, decided something else against the people.<\/p> <p>On September 17, 1995, in a very unfortunate incident, the martyred leader left his residence at Chanesar Goth for his office and in the middle of the bridge, unknown ruthless assassins attacked and separated this selfless leader of the workers from his fellows forever.<\/p> <p>Although Shaheed Usan Ghani is no more with us, but his memory and the sacrifices he made for the workers are still fresh in our minds. His efforts for the restoration of rights and democracy will live forever in the history. For the working class, it is also a source of satisfaction that the struggle and the sacrifices made by Usman Ghani has been taken up by his son Saeed Ghani. He possesses dynamic and progressive leadership qualities. He is the president of Pakistan Peoples Party Karachi division and provincial minister for labour.<\/p> <p>We, on behalf of the working class, stand by his side and we also pray for the success of the son of the martyr.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3KG2UQJ0ML3N4DKD0KJYB9CA5KAQNK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":742,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1973","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Karachi","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Usman Ghani","victim_keywords":"banker, activist, union leader, repeat arrests, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1973","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Karachi","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Usman Ghani","victim_keywords":"banker, activist, union leader, repeat arrests, killed","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":958490460,"Input.title":"Bharat Bandh invokes mixed response in UP, SP workers protest","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-08 17:10:35+05:30","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Bharat Bandh called by farmer unions, protesting the three Central agri laws, drew a mixed response in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday with shops and offices remaining largely open, while the Samajwadi Party held protests in a number of districts and even holding up a train in Allahabad.<\/p> <p>Samajwadi Party leaders sat on a silent protest near the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh at the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow in support of the bandh.

On Tuesday, Binniyat was arraigned at the Barnawa Magistrate\u2019s Court in Kaduna state. He was charged with cyberstalking, a charge that critics say is often used in the African country to silence the media.<\/p> <p>On Nov. 4, Binniyat informed Epoch Times Africa Desk Editor Doug Burton that he was arrested and urged the editor to \u201ccontact all relevant persons.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burton elaborated on the circumstances leading up to Binniyat\u2019s arrest and the dangers he faces in an interview with The Christian Post.<\/p> <p>Burton attributed Binniyat\u2019s arrest to an Oct. 29 article he wrote titled \u201cIn Nigeria, Police Decry Massacres as \u2018Wicked\u2019 But Make No Arrests.\u201d The article is part of The Epoch Times\u2019 coverage of the deadly persecution of Christian farming communities in the African country that human rights advocates say have escalated to near \u201cgenocidal levels\u201d in recent years as thousands have been killed.<\/p> <p>In the article, Binniyat pushed back on Kaduna\u2019s Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan\u2019s characterization of an attack on Christian farmers in the state as a \u201cclash.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Nigerian government has long refuted claims by human rights activists that a religious genocide is taking place in Nigeria\u2019s Middle Belt states, where radicals from the Fulani herding community have been accused of invading countless Christian farming communities. The government has long attributed attacks and reprisals as being part of decades-old farmer-herder clashes.<\/p> <p>In his article, Binniyat included a quote from a Nigerian senator, who accused the Kaduna government of \u201cusing Samuel Aruwan, a Christian, to cause confusion to cover up the genocide going on in Christian Southern Kaduna by describing the measure as a \u2018clash\u2019\u201d as opposed to a targeted act of violence against Christians.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat he [Binniyat] did there is he showed that the commissioner was projecting a false narrative,\u201d Burton explained. \u201cFor this reason, I think the authorities, though they knew they would get pushback for prosecuting a dissident journalist, they decided they had to do it because \u2026 they want to shut his voice down.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burton told CP that the journalist was accused of cyberstalking Aruwan. Cyberstalking is a federal offense.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe magistrate ruled that he does not have authority to try the charge of cyberstalking because it\u2019s a federal charge, it\u2019s a federal statute. So the case will have to be transferred to a federal court. And so, therefore, in the meantime, he can\u2019t get bail because the magistrate doesn\u2019t have authority to give him bail since he doesn\u2019t have authority over this crime.\u201d<\/p> <p>Sources Burton spoke to believe that the prosecution is using a \u201clegal technicality to keep Luka in jail.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cBy having his charges presented first in a lower court, a district court where he was charged, they expected him to be charged with defamation and injurious falsehood,\u201d Burton said. \u201cThese are statutes \u2026 in the criminal code in Nigeria and can be tried at the lower court level.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cBut the charge of \u2026 cyberstalking is a federal charge that \u2026 has to be issued by a higher court,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd so by doing that deliberately, the prosecution knew that bail couldn\u2019t be given, and that is the whole idea.\u201d<\/p> <p>On Monday morning, Binniyat \u201ctexted that he felt like his life was in danger,\u201d Burton said.<\/p> <p>Additionally, Binniyat said he had been held for five days in a very \u201ccramped\u201d and \u201cdingy\u201d cell that he described as \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Binniyat further alleged that he hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe texted to another person, another journalist I know named John Shiklam. And Shiklam said he feared for his life,\u201d Burton detailed.<\/p> <p>Based on conversations with other people who have faced detention for cyberstalking in Nigeria, Burton estimates that Binniyat could spend about five months in prison.<\/p> <p>Burton specifically cited the case of Stephen Kefas, who \u201cwrote something on Facebook that embarrassed\u201d a government official. The government official claimed he was being cyberstalked and feared he could be attacked because of what Kefas wrote.<\/p> <p>Burton indicated that prolonged detention could have an impact on Binniyat\u2019s physical health.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe folks who have to spend time in custody, they have to endure pretty harsh conditions and they get sick,\u201d he warned.<\/p> <p>Kefas contracted Hepatitis C while in prison, and members of the Adara tribe who spent time in prison caught malaria, typhoid and\/or dysentery, Burton stressed.<\/p> <p>\u201cBased on what I have learned with my many conversations with Steven Kefas, the conditions in prison are not only uncomfortable, but they\u2019re dangerous and toxic,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe Adara elders were in a common cell with other criminals. They had no toilet. They have a sewer trench that goes through the middle of the cell, which serves as their toilet. Apparently, the prisoners don\u2019t have proper protection from mosquitoes because many of them come out with malaria.\u201d<\/p> <p>Based on a conversation Burton had International Committee on Nigeria Executive Director Kyle Abts, who has delivered rations to prisoners in the past, \u201cthe prisons \u2026 and jails don\u2019t provide food and water for the prisoners.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cAll their food and water has to be brought to them by their relatives,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Those without relatives or anyone to bring them food and water can \u201cbeg for charitable donations\u201d from other prisoners.<\/p> <p>Because Binniyat is \u201cnot wealthy,\u201d Burton predicted \u201che will need assistance\u201d in his legal proceedings.<\/p> <p>\u201cHis legal bills will have to be paid by his friends. That would be the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, SKPU, and also he will be getting some financial aid probably from the International Committee on Nigeria,\u201d Burton detailed. \u201cHis friends and allies are \u2026 planning some kind of a legal defense fund, but it\u2019s not clear who will take the lead.\u201d<\/p> <p>Binniyat\u2019s arrest for cyberstalking is not the first time the journalist has faced legal headwinds for his reporting.<\/p> <p>Burton recalled that Binniyat was previously imprisoned in 2017 for \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d<\/p> <p>Binniyat had previously served as the bureau chief of Vanguard Newspapers until 2017.<\/p> <p>\u201cThen after he was imprisoned, I don\u2019t think he got hired by any newspaper group because, the way it was explained to me, he\u2019s considered a controversial reporter,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo I started working with him in March this year, maybe May of this year. And I encouraged him to \u2026 compile reports for The Epoch Times. I worked with him as his editor. And so he\u2019s published some very timely and factual reports about kidnappings and mass murders this year.\u201d<\/p> <p>Burton maintained that the central claim made by Aruwan highlighted in Binniyat\u2019s Oct. 29 story, that the attacks on Christian farming communities in Nigeria are simply \u201cclashes\u201d between farmers and herders, is widely held and promoted by Nigerian government officials.<\/p> <p>\u201cThat is a distorted representation of what\u2019s really happening.

The stories of mass murder and rape he heard there called to mind his decade working as a prosecutor at the United Nations tribunal to try those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide.<\/p> <p>Peter Dejong\/AP Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, right, and Yasmin Ullah of the Rohingya community, left, react outside the International Court in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan. 23, 2020, after the court ordered Myanmar take all measures in its power to prevent genocide against the Rohingya.<\/p> <p>\u201cI saw genocide written all over these stories,\u201d he recalled in an interview with Reuters last year.<\/p> <p>With the OIC\u2019s backing, Mr. Tambadou\u2019s office filed a lawsuit at the ICJ, the United Nations\u2019 top court, in November last year, alleging that Myanmar had committed genocide against the Rohingya and asking that the court order the country to protect the group from further persecution. Myanmar has acknowledged war crimes, but repeatedly denied that genocide took place.<\/p> <p>Because every U.N. member state has equal standing in the ICJ, it didn\u2019t matter that Gambia was much smaller than Myanmar, or far from its borders. All that mattered, Ms. Maunganidze notes, was the strength of the case it assembled from UN reports and other investigations into the violence.<\/p> <p>But for Gambia, the case was also personal.<\/p> <p>\u201cTwenty-two years of a brutal dictatorship has taught us how to use our voice,\u201d Mr. Tambadou told Reuters, referring to the rule of former President Yahya Jammeh, who was at last ousted from power in the country\u2019s 2016 election. \u201cWe know too well how it feels like to be unable to tell your story to the world, to be unable to share your pain in the hope that someone out there will hear and help.\u201d<\/p> <p>Mr. Jammeh\u2019s repressive rule, which included the killings and common arrests of anti-government activists, journalists, and other members of the opposition, was all the more painful for what preceded it.<\/p> <p>In the first two decades of its independence, which it won in 1965, Gambia had been a regional human rights leader, notes Oumar Ba, an assistant professor of political science at Morehouse College in Atlanta who studies international criminal justice. Under its then-president Dawda Jawara, Gambia hosted the experts assigned to draft an African human rights charter, which eventually became the 1981 Banjul Charter. Since the late 1980s, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights has been based in Banjul, Gambia\u2019s capital.<\/p> <p>Gambia\u2019s role in shaping the continent\u2019s human rights record was abruptly interrupted in 1994, when Mr. Jammeh overthrew Mr. Jawara in a military coup. For the next 22 years, Gambians suffered \u201ca whole range of human rights violations,\u201d according to a report by Amnesty International, \u201cincluding unlawful detention, torture while in detention, unfair trials, enforced disappearance and extrajudicial executions.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cRight now the government of Gambia is trying to retake that mantle and go back to that position of leadership that it had in the region before Jammeh took power,\u201d Professor Ba says.<\/p> <p>Gambia\u2019s stand is not without complications. In recent months, the country\u2019s president, Adama Barrow, has faced repeated criticism for reneging on a promise to step down from office after three years, and for a violent crackdown on protests calling for him to step down, which left dozens wounded.<\/p> <p>The contradiction between the Gambia\u2019s international stand and its domestic troubles \u201cis a tension within the state itself,\u201d Ms. Maunganidze says. Like any country, the Gambia\u2019s government is not a monolith, and contains both officials who support its leadership in international human rights and others for whom it is far less important. But crucially, she notes, \u201cthe fact that the process proceeded the way it did means it wasn\u2019t blocked, even if it wasn\u2019t something everyone in government agreed with.\u201d<\/p> <p>The ICJ\u2019s order is provisional, but orders Myanmar\u2019s government to take emergency measures to protect the Rohingya while the case continues, and to preserve any evidence connected to the allegations of genocide. The case itself could take years to formally decide, and Myanmar may flout the orders.<\/p> <p>Get stories that<\/p> <p>empower and uplift daily.

Rooftop snipers were ordered to shoot to kill, police and army raided homes of journalists, doctors, politicians and protesting citizens. Independent media were outlawed and journalists were forced into hiding.<\/p> <p>Critics of the \u2018coup\u2019, or even naming it as such in reporting or on social media, resulted in arrest warrants for breaches of section 505(a) of the penal code. Non-profit human rights organisation Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) confirmed as of August 4, 2021, the military had killed 946 people, including 75 children and arrested 7,051 protestors. Among them, seven health workers have been killed, another 600 doctors and nurses have arrest warrants issued against them, a further 221 medical students have been arrested and 67 medical staff are in detention. AAPP reported the military has arrested at least 98 journalists, six of whom have been tried and convicted. Journalists may have gone into hiding for their safety, but this hasn\u2019t stopped the military targeting and threatening their families.<\/p> <p>A country in chaos<\/p> <p>Myanmar is now in crisis. The economy has crashed. The already threadbare healthcare system has collapsed from the strain of the Covid-19 pandemic. Military restrictions prevent people receiving medical treatment, while doctors and nurses continue to be arrested for protesting the coup. Meanwhile, people infected by the Covid-19 virus face certain death via the military\u2019s heartless restrictions on hospitals, oxygen and medicine. Doctors who manage to work from clandestine pop-up clinics are exhausted by the huge surge in cases needing treatment.<\/p> <p>International health experts estimate as many as half the country\u2019s population could become infected with the various Covid-19 strains and the risk of death is high.<\/p> <p>United Nation\u2019s human rights expert Tom Andrews has urged Myanmar\u2019s military at the end of July to join a \u2018Covid ceasefire\u2019 to combat the pandemic sweeping the country. But international pleas are unlikely to sway the military coup leaders or its puppet, the State Administration Council, now reformed as a caretaker government under the leadership of General Min Aung Hlaing as its so-called prime minister.<\/p> <p>The military has a certain form when handling natural disasters \u2013 its strategy is to treat them as security threats. When Cyclone Nargis battered Burma on May 2, 2008, killing as many as 138,000 people and affecting at least another 2.4 million, the military\u2019s response was to block international aid and jail those who reported on or tried to help storm victims.<\/p> <p>The same strategy has been used with the ceasefires it negotiates with ethnic armed groups. A senior Karen National Liberation Army officer told the IFJ that ceasefires with the military produce little for the people. \u201cOur experience is they tie us up in endless meetings that yield little of value. They are a delaying tactic and we know they map our army positions and those of displaced people camps and later attack us as happened in March this year.\u201d<\/p> <p>In March 2021, the Myanmar armed forces launched a series of airstrikes and ground attacks in ethnic regions that left as many as 200,000 villagers displaced. These people are now in desperate need of basic shelter, medicine, food and security. The military\u2019s go-to strategy is to block critical aid and medicine getting to displaced people and to jail and kill those it classifies as its enemies. Since the February coup, these \u2018enemies\u2019 have included doctors, lawyers, politicians, community leaders, activists and journalists.<\/p> <p>AAPP said people are now having to face the Covid-19 pandemic with under-resourced hospitals and clinics with most unable to buy basic medicine from pharmacies that have run out of stock. Basic medicine is hard to find and expensive to buy. The military is forcing public hospitals to close and is actively stopping people buying or refilling oxygen cylinders. Cemeteries and crematoriums are unable to cope with the huge numbers of fatalities, leaving corpses to pile up. Through all this, the State Administration Council is accused by international, regional and opposition health professionals of withholding statistics and issuing false information.<\/p> <p>I\u2019m Only Doing my Job<\/p> <p>Senior journalist Win Kyaw, who is now in hiding on the Myanmar border, spoke with IFJ about the ongoing difficulties of trying to keep reporting six months on from the coup. \u201cI fled my home months ago. I left everything behind. Now it\u2019s much worse for journalists worried about catching Covid. We can\u2019t go move around because of soldiers at checkpoints checking phones and who we are. It is very hard to keep going.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said there is no way to counterbalance the false information and quackery remedies circulating among people desperate for ways to combat the virus. \u201cBefore the coup, I reported the first and second wave freely. We only worried about catching the infection. Authorities willingly gave us data, information. Since the coup it\u2019s the opposite. The military is trying to arrest us, we have to work secretly, we can\u2019t get any information from authorities or our old sources. How can people make informed decisions about treatments and what medicines to take with all the misinformation being spread?\u201d<\/p> <p>Win Kyaw has an arrest warrant issued against him for what the military claims are breaches of section 505(a) of the Penal Code. \u201cI was only doing my job as a journalist, but they saw our news coverage as a threat. If we are not allowed to do our job uncensored at such a critical time it causes all sorts of problems. People need to know what to do and what not to do during the pandemic. We also know important stories putting the military under scrutiny need to be reported. For example, what\u2019s happened to the USD 350million donated to the country by the International Monetary Fund (to help prevent Covid)? It\u2019s important accredited journalists cover these stories and we are allowed to do our job.\u201d<\/p> <p>Win Kyaw acknowledges the difficulty of confirming actual death rates from Covid-19 as the State Administration Council reports are sanctioned and approved by military leaders. \u201cWe know the military is restricting oxygen and medical supplies and jailing doctors. We know people are dying in their thousands.\u201d<\/p> <p>A recent incident involving a senior Myanmar Army officer highlighted the need to keep the spotlight on corruption, he said. The story the journalist is referring to involved Myo Min Naung, an army colonel who ordered the seizure of 100 oxygen cylinders crossing from Thai border town Mae Sot to Myawaddy on the Myanmar side. Myo Min Naung first denied he had taken the cylinders but was later quoted in state-owned media saying he had only \u2018borrowed\u2019 the oxygen for emergency use in Karen State hospitals.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is a clear case of abuse of authority,\u201d says Win Kyaw. \u201cIt was clear the oxygen had the official paperwork and been ordered by a Yangon charity to treat Covid patients. As far as we know the oxygen has not been returned.\u201d<\/p> <p>The journalist is convinced the military is deliberately using Covid-19 against citizens. \u201cGovernment hospitals are full \u2013 they cannot take anymore Covid-19 patients. People are forced to rely on home treatment. Knowing this, the military blocked people refilling oxygen cylinders for private use, restricted medicine and closed hospitals \u2013 the military is using Covid-19 as a weapon to kill people.\u201d<\/p> <p>Win Kyaw has just recovered from fighting the virus while in hiding. \u201cIt was hard. Out of our seven people in the household, four were sick. We had the symptoms, we couldn\u2019t get tested, we didn\u2019t know if it was the flu or Covid. We were lucky\u2026 we could get oxygen, medical advice and medicine.\u201d<\/p> <p>Every journalist the IFJ has spoken to during the past six months since he coup has either been infected and or had a family member die.<\/p> <p>Despite knowing the risks and the fact that the military is actively hunting him, Win Kyaw is determined to keep reporting. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t get salaries now, as most independent media houses have been outlawed by the military, but we feel we have a duty to cover the news as best we can. We have to try to travel to confirm stories and this puts us at risk. We need money for masks and PPE, medicine and oxygen concentrators.\u201d<\/p> <p>When their media organizations\u2019 operating licenses were cancelled by the military, many independent journalists had to go underground or risk arrest. Without paid work many journalists resorted to selling their equipment \u2013 laptops, drones, voice recorders and cameras \u2013 keeping only the essentials needed to keep reporting.<\/p> <p>People dying alone<\/p> <p>Than Win Htut, a senior executive with the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), is still managing to send out regular daily reports despite having to hide on the border of a neighboring country.<\/p> <p>Like other journalists interviewed, Than Win Thut is dismayed at the carnage caused by the military\u2019s refusal to stop harassing and jailing doctors and let them tackle the pandemic as a public health issue. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. People are dying alone, collapsing in the street. Yet high ranking officers are taking oxygen and medicine for themselves and leaving lower rank soldiers to fend for themselves. The people have to manage the best they can, they can no longer expect anything from the government.\u201d<\/p> <p>Than Win Htut explains that reporting the health crisis was proving problematic. \u201cWe cannot risk sending our reporters to confirm what\u2019s happening at crematoriums or graveyards. Official sources won\u2019t confirm or talk \u2013 they\u2019re too scared. We keep in contact with our sources, but we can only manage to give estimates. State media can\u2019t be relied on\u2026 nobody believes what it reports.\u201d<\/p> <p>The need for accurate reporting was never more important, he said. \u201cPeople are skeptical of vaccines, schools are closed, everywhere is overcrowded, there have been jail riots by anti-coup prisoners\u2026 unconfirmed killings of 20 jail protestors, doctors are being jailed, the cost of living is sky high, no work\u2026 no wages, medical supplies are being blocked\u2026 charity workers jailed.\u201d<\/p> <p>He says the pandemic has completely changed social media interactions. \u201cFacebook and social media sites have become our obituary pages. We see posts everyday of friends or their family members who have died. It\u2019s tragic. We can\u2019t do our job because the military has weaponised Covid.\u201d<\/p> <p>Lost hope waiting on UN intervention<\/p> <p>Wei Min Oo is still managing to work for a news agency and told IFJ he is lucky he still has a job. \u201cWhen the junta closed eight independent media outlets, hundreds of employed journalists were suddenly forced out of work. Journalists, like everyone, have to eat. Some journalists have opened online shops, young ones have become delivery riders and some can\u2019t do anything, but try to live on their meagre savings.\u201d<\/p> <p>Trying to report when you can be arrested for just doing your job is one of the big difficulties. \u201cWe can\u2019t carry our journalist\u2019s IDs. We have to make sure our phones are cleaned off as anything like Facebook that could get us in trouble at checkpoints. No bylines on stories. Journalists have to rely on social media as sources.\u201d<\/p> <p>Wei Min Oo said the massive number of Covid-19 infections in the community means that reporters dare not go to areas under martial law or known crisis areas for fear of being arrested.<\/p> <p>The actions of the military during the pandemic has exposed its disregard for civilians and community institutions critical to a democratic society, according to Wei Min Oo. \u201cThe military is taking its revenge on doctors, health workers, teachers, students, politicians and charity volunteers for taking a stand by striking and speaking out.\u201d<\/p> <p>Meanwhile people in Myanmar are scathing of international interventions happening and have resigned to opposing the military alone, he said. \u201cPeople now say \u2018we have lost hope any international intervention will come \u2013 if we want a revolution we have to do it alone through our Civil Disobedience Movement\u2019.\u201d<\/p> <p>There\u2019s no plan<\/p> <p>Saw Win, a senior journalist who has worked in ethnic media for more than 20 years spoke to the IFJ about the greater effects the coup has had. \u201cThe country is in chaos. The coup is a citizen\u2019s nightmare. People have given up on international help. Working the borderline we see \u2013 displacement, refugees, corruption, armed conflict \u2013 any help will come with restrictions imposed on it by the military. Aid will eventually be allowed in and available, but it will not reach the people in need.\u201d<\/p> <p>Saw Win stresses the importance of accredited journalists being allowed to cover the pandemic. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe what they hear or see on state media. It\u2019s total rubbish. Data, death rates, number of cases and health information are not believed. People joke the military run pictures and names of those they intend to arrest under 505 (a) on state television and newspapers to get people to tune in \u2013 it\u2019s the only item we can believe the rest is useless.\u201d<\/p> <p>Covid\u2019s impacts in the cities are worse than those experienced in rural areas, he says.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have pharmacies unable to buy or sell medicines, we hear of groups and individuals with links to the military profiting from selling oxygen cylinders, people can\u2019t bury or cremate their loved ones, wet season floods, farmers not farming, food shortages, cooking oil prices have increased by as much as 33 per cent, essential shops are closing, refugee camps are struggling, there\u2019s more than 200,000 displaced people in our region in desperate need of everything \u2013 these are all important stories our journalists need to keep covering.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<\/p> <p>Phil Thornton is a journalist and senior adviser to the International Federation of Journalists in South East Asia.<\/p> <p>*Names have been changed for the protection of journalists<\/p> <p>This article first appeared on IFJ.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"37S0QRNUFDVWV2XD8ODF7L1FMG888G"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1130,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":null,"city":"Myanmar","region":"None","country":"Asia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, doctors, politicians, protesting citizens","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Win Kyaw","victim_keywords":"journalist, hiding","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Than Win Htut","victim_keywords":"senior executive with the Democratic Voice of Burma, hiding","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":null,"city":"Myanmar","region":"None","country":"Asia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, doctors, politicians, protesting citizens","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Win Kyaw","victim_keywords":"journalist, hiding","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Than Win Htut","victim_keywords":"senior executive with the Democratic Voice of Burma, hiding","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1030978378,"Input.title":"Chechnya's leader invites Macron, Merkel to visit his region","Input.publish_date":"2017-05-31 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>ABOVE: Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov (Photo by the Press Service of the President of the Russian Federation; courtesy www.kremlin.ru)<\/p> <p>MOSCOW (AP) \u2013 The leader of Russia\u2019s Chechnya has invited the French president and the German chancellor to visit his region and check for themselves the reports about gay people being killed and tortured there.<\/p> <p>The Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported in April that gay men in Chechnya had been tortured and killed by police.

Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter, and General Electric are the main weapons manufacturers contracted to profit from the deal.<\/p> <p>Following this announcement, a 30-day window for Congress to review and voice opposition to the sale commenced. It is imperative that we stop this avalanche of military aid for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s regime.<\/p> <p>Duterte\u2019s human rights record is atrocious. If the arms sale goes through, it will escalate a worsening crackdown on human rights defenders and on dissent \u2014 while fomenting an ongoing bloodbath. Duterte is infamous for launching a \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d that, since 2016, has claimed the lives of as many as 27,000 souls, mostly low-income people summarily executed by police and vigilantes.<\/p> <p>In Duterte\u2019s first three years of office, nearly 300 journalists, human rights lawyers, environmentalists, peasant leaders, trade unionists, and human rights defenders were assassinated. The Philippines has been ranked the deadliest country for environmentalists in the world, after Brazil. Many of these slayings are linked to military personnel.<\/p> <p>Now, Duterte is using COVID-19 as a pretext for further militarization and repression, despite the dire consequences for public health.<\/p> <p>Around the world, and particularly for the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the contradiction between military capacity and human well-being. This arms deal is yet another example of the U.S. government\u2019s gross misallocation of resources towards war profiteering and militarization, rather than health services and human needs. The Pentagon\u2019s bloated budget of trillions has done nothing to protect us from a public health catastrophe, and has failed to create true security.<\/p> <p>Only a complete realignment of federal priorities away from militarization, here and abroad, and towards strengthening infrastructures of care will.<\/p> <p>Duterte\u2019s militarized response to COVID-19<\/p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a pretext for Duterte to impose military checkpoints, mass arrests, and de facto martial law throughout the Philippines.<\/p> <p>As of late April, over 120,000 people have been cited for quarantine violations, and over 30,000 arrested \u2014 despite the severe overcrowding in Philippine jails, already exacerbated by the drug war. \u201cStay at home\u201d orders are ruthlessly enforced by the police, even as in many urban poor communities, people live hand-to-mouth.<\/p> <p>Without daily earnings, millions are desperate for food. By late April, a majority of indigent households had still not received any government relief. A thousand residents in Pasay were forced into homelessness when their informal settlement was destroyed in the name of slum clearance at the beginning of the lockdown, even as the homeless are arrested and thrown in jail.<\/p> <p>Duterte has placed the military in charge of COVID-19 response. On April 1, he ordered troops to \u201cshoot dead\u201d quarantine violators, causing human rights abuses to immediately surge. The next day, a farmer, Junie Dugog Pi\u00f1ar, was shot and killed by police for violating the COVID-19 lockdown in Agusan del Norte, Mindanao.<\/p> <p>Police have locked curfew violators in dog cages, used torture and sexual humiliation as punishment against LGBTQ people, and beaten and arrested urban poor people protesting for food. Beatings and killings to enforce \u201cenhanced community quarantine\u201d continue. Meanwhile, a teacher was arrested simply for posting \u201cprovoking\u201d comments on social media that decried the lack of government relief, while an artist was detained two nights without a warrant for a sarcastic post on COVID-19.<\/p> <p>Mutual aid, solidarity, and resistance<\/p> <p>In the face of widespread hunger, inadequate health care, and lethal repression, vibrant grassroots social movement organizations have created mutual aid and relief initiatives providing food, masks, and medical supplies to the poor.<\/p> <p>Cure Covid, a network of volunteers across myriad organizations in the greater Metro Manila region, has organized relief packs and community kitchens for thousands, while engaging in community organizing to strengthen mutual aid. Movement organizers are calling for mass testing, basic services, and an end to the militarized COVID-19 response.<\/p> <p>Kadamay is a mass-based organization of 200,000 urban poor people across the Philippines that has been at the forefront of resisting Duterte\u2019s drug war and reclaiming vacant housing for homeless people. In 2017, Kadamay led 12,000 homeless people in occupying 6,000 vacant homes that had been set aside for the police and military in Pandi, Bulacan. Despite repression and intimidation, #OccupyBulacan continues to this day.<\/p> <p>With COVID-19, Kadamay has led mutual aid efforts and #ProtestFromHome pot-banging actions, with video disseminated on social media, to demand relief and health services, not militarization. In immediate reprisal for voicing dissent after one pot-banging, the national spokesperson of Kadamay, Mimi Doringo, was threatened with arrest. In Bulacan, a community leader was taken to a military encampment and told to cease all political activity and \u201csurrender\u201d to the government or he would get no relief aid.<\/p> <p>Efforts at mutual aid are being criminalized and targeted for repression. Since late April, police have carried out mass arrests of relief volunteers, alongside street vendors and those seeking food. On April 19, seven relief volunteers from Sagip Kanayunan were detained while on their way to distribute food in Bulacan, and later charged with inciting \u201csedition.\u201d On April 24, 50 urban poor residents in Quezon City, including a relief volunteer, were detained for not carrying quarantine passes or wearing face masks. On May 1, ten volunteers conducting relief with the women\u2019s organization Gabriela were arrested while conducting a community feeding in Marikina City.<\/p> <p>This targeting is no accident. Since 2018, an executive order by Duterte has authorized a \u201cwhole-of-nation approach\u201d to counterinsurgency, through a broad array of government agencies, resulting in increased repression against community organizers and human rights defenders generally.<\/p> <p>The crackdowns against mutual aid and survival have prompted campaigns on social media to \u201cstop criminalizing care and community.\u201d Save San Roque, a network supporting the resistance of urban poor residents against demolition, has started a petition to immediately release relief volunteers and all low-level quarantine violators. Human rights organizations are also petitioning for the release of political prisoners, many of them low-income farmers, trade unionists, and human rights defenders facing trumped up charges, including the elderly and ill.<\/p> <p>As a direct result of the government response focused on militarization, rather than adequate health care, food, and services, the Philippines has among the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia, and the pandemic is quickly worsening.<\/p> <p>Colonial roots<\/p> <p>Today\u2019s U.S.-Philippine military alliance has its roots in the U.S. colonization and occupation of the Philippines over a hundred years ago.<\/p> <p>Despite granting the Philippines independence in 1946, the U.S. has used unequal trade agreements and its military presence to maintain the Philippines\u2019 neocolonial status ever since. For decades, propping up oligarchic rulers and preventing land reform guaranteed the U.S. cheap agricultural exports. The U.S. military assisted with countering a string of continual rebellions.<\/p> <p>U.S. military aid still continues to facilitate corporate extraction of Philippine natural resources, real estate monopoly, and repression of indigenous and peasant struggles for land rights \u2014 particularly in Mindanao, a hotbed of communist, indigenous, and Muslim separatist resistance and the recent center of military operations.<\/p> <p>The Philippine armed forces are focused on domestic counterinsurgency, overwhelmingly directing violence against poor and marginalized people within the country\u2019s own borders. Philippine military and police operations are closely intertwined. In fact, historically the Philippine police developed out of counter-insurgency operations during U.S. colonial rule.<\/p> <p>The U.S. military itself maintains a troop presence in the Philippines through its Operation Pacific Eagle and other exercises.<\/p> <p>In the name of \u201ccounterterrorism,\u201d U.S. military aid is helping Duterte wage war on Philippine soil and repress civilian dissent. Since 2017, Duterte has imposed martial law on Mindanao, where he has repeatedly dropped bombs. Military attacks have displaced over 450,000 civilians.<\/p> <p>Carried out with U.S. backing and even joint activities, Duterte\u2019s military operations are shoring up the corporate land-grabbing of indigenous lands and massacres of farmers organizing for their land rights. Paramilitaries backed by the armed forces are terrorizing indigenous communities, targeting schools and teachers.<\/p> <p>In February, prior to the announced arms deal, Duterte nominally rescinded the U.S.-Philippines Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which allows U.S. troops to be stationed in the Philippines for \u201cjoint exercises.\u201d On the surface, this was in response to the U.S. denying a visa to former drug war police chief Ronald \u201cBato\u201d Dela Rosa. However, Duterte\u2019s revocation of the VFA is not immediately effective, and only begins a 6-month process of renegotiation.<\/p> <p>The proposed arms sale signals that Trump intends to strengthen his military backing for Duterte. The Pentagon seeks to maintain a close military \u201cpartnership.\u201d<\/p> <p>End U.S. military aid<\/p> <p>A growing international movement, in solidarity with indigenous and Filipino communities, is calling for an end to military aid to the Philippines. U.S. direct military aid to Duterte\u2019s regime totaled over $193.5 million in 2018, not counting pre-allocated amounts and donated weapons of unreported worth. Military aid also consists of grants to purchase arms, usually from U.S. contractors.<\/p> <p>Relatedly, the U.S. government regulates the flow of private arms sales abroad \u2014 such as the current proposed sale. Sales brokered by the U.S. government are often a public subsidy to private contractors, using our U.S. tax dollars to complete the purchase. Congress must use its power to cut the pending sale off.<\/p> <p>The latest proposed $2 billion arms sale includes 12 attack helicopters, hundreds of missiles and warheads, guidance and detection systems, machine guns, and over 80,000 rounds of ammunition. The State Department says these, too, would be used for \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d \u2014 i.e., repression in the Philippines. Due to lack of transparency and Duterte\u2019s deliberate efforts to obscure aid flows, U.S. military aid may well end up providing ammunition to the armed forces waging Duterte\u2019s drug war, to vigilantes, or to paramilitaries, all without public scrutiny.<\/p> <p>Duterte is using the pandemic as a pretext to continue crushing political opposition. He has now assumed special emergency powers. Even prior to the pandemic, in October 2019, police and military raided the offices of Gabriela, opposition party Bayan Muna, and the National Federation of Sugar Workers, arresting over 57 people in Bacolod City and Metro Manila in one sweep.<\/p> <p>Tragically, repression is quickly escalating.<\/p> <p>On April 30, after weeks of police intimidation for conducting feeding programs, Jory Porquia, a founding member of Bayan Muna, was assassinated inside his home in Iloilo. Over 76 protesters and relief workers were illegally arrested on May Day, including four youth feeding program volunteers in Quezon City, four residents who posted online photos of their \u201cprotesting from home\u201d in Valenzuela, two unionists holding placards in Rizal, and 42 people conducting a vigil for slain human rights defender Porquia in Iloilo. Sixteen workers in a Coca-Cola factory in Laguna were abducted and forced by the military to \u201csurrender\u201d posing as armed insurgents.<\/p> <p>The U.S.\u2019s war machine profits its private contractors at our expense. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing relied on the Pentagon for a third of its income. In April, Boeing received a bailout of $882 million to restart a paused Air Force contract \u2014 for refueling aircraft that are in fact, defective. But for-profit weapons manufacturers and other war profiteers should have no place steering our foreign policy.<\/p> <p>Congress has the power to dissent but must act swiftly. Rep. Ilhan Omar has introduced a bill to stop arming human rights abusers such as Duterte. This month, the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines, Communications Workers of America, and others, will launch a bill specifically to end military aid to the Philippines. In the meantime, we must urge Congress to stop the proposed arms sales to the Philippines: please sign this petition to do so.<\/p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is baring the need for global solidarity against militarization and austerity. In taking up the fight against the deep footprint of U.S. imperialism, here and abroad, our movements will make each other stronger.<\/p> <p>*The author has a doctorate in American Studies and Ethnicity and is a Mellon-ACLS Public Fellow.

The Burundian authorities should demonstrate their commitment to protecting human rights by immediately releasing Nkina and dropping all the charges against him. Burundi's international partners should support the calls for his release.<\/p> <p>Nkina, a lawyer in Kayanza province in northern Burundi, was arrested on October 13, 2020, in Kabarore commune, where he was visiting a client for his professional work. He was briefly detained by the intelligence service in Kayanza, then transferred to police detention, and finally to Ngozi prison, where he is currently detained.<\/p> <p>October 2020 was a tense period in Kayanza following attacks by an armed group in the previous weeks, with several people killed or abducted. Nkina happened to visit Kabarore, one of the areas affected, soon after these attacks. The authorities accused him of collaborating with the armed opposition group RED-Tabara (Resistance for the Rule of Law in Burundi), which they hold responsible for the attacks, and charged him with endangering internal state security.<\/p> <p>On June 15, 2021, the court of Kayanza convicted Nkina of \"collaboration with rebels who attacked Burundi,\" and sentenced him to five years in prison and a fine of one million Burundian francs (approximately US$ 500). His client, Apollinaire Hitimana, whom he had been advising on a land dispute and was arrested with him, was found guilty of complicity in the same offence and sentenced to two and a half years and a fine of 500,000 Burundian francs. An appeal hearing is scheduled for August 12, at the Ngozi court of appeal.<\/p> <p>Nkina was APRODH's representative in Kayanza until the government suspended the organization in 2015 as part of a larger crackdown on civil society over opposition to President Pierre Nkurunziza running for a controversial third term. He has not worked for APRODH or any other Burundian civil society organization for the past six years. He is a well-known lawyer in Kayanza and a member of the Gitega bar. However, authorities in Kayanza may still associate him with APRODH, especially as he was riding his former APRODH motorcycle on the day of his arrest.<\/p> <p>The prosecution accused him, among other things, of travelling to Rwanda to give information to APRODH's president, Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, who lives in Europe, as well as to RED-Tabara. The prosecution has not presented any evidence to substantiate these allegations.<\/p> <p>Nkina is the only known former staff member of a human rights organization imprisoned in Burundi at the present time. Two other human rights defenders were released earlier in 2021.<\/p> <p>For further details about the government repression of human rights activists, please see below.<\/p> <p>Background<\/p> <p>APRODH was one of Burundi's most active and best-known human rights organizations. Mbonimpa narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 2015 with life-threatening injuries. Mbonimpa's son and his son-in-law were both shot dead in 2015.<\/p> <p>APRODH's representative in Gitega province, Nestor Nibitanga, was arrested in 2017 and sentenced in 2018 to five years in prison on charges similar to those brought against Nkina. He was released in April as part of President \u00c9variste Ndayishimiye's pardon of more than 5,000 prisoners.<\/p> <p>Another human rights defender, Germain Rukuki, was arrested in 2017 and sentenced to 32 years in prison in 2018 on trumped-up charges related to his human rights work. His sentence was confirmed by the appeal court in 2019, but the appeal court's decision was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court. The appeal court reduced his sentence to one year in June 2021. He was released the same month.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Human Rights Legal Affairs NGO By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

More than half of all those detained last year faced national security-related charges.<\/p> <p>All 30 Turkish intellectuals included in the index faced such charges, the PEN researchers found. Among them was Zehra Dogan, a Kurdish artist and journalist charged in 2017 over a painting of the Turkish city of Nusaybin in the country\u2019s southeast, the site of clashes between the Turkish military and the Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party (PKK) in 2016.

Residents, the document asserts, were generally too frightened to denounce these chilling crimes, for they knew that they had the sanction of the police and the state.<\/p> <p>The report went on to describe mass graves, \u201cwhere the bodies of many young people were taken,\u201d in the cities of Yumbo and Buga. It noted: \u201cThe people who have shared their testimony indicated that the youths were detained, some of them have been reported missing by their friends or families, and in Guacari, in Buga, 45 minutes from Cali, they were executed. Some of the survivors of the executions were found with gunshot wounds in health centers and today are terrified and in hiding.\u201d<\/p> <p>Protesters clash with police in Madrid, on the outskirts of Bogota, Colombia, Friday, May 28, 2021. (AP Photo\/Ivan Valencia)<\/p> <p>Thousands of people involved in protests have been arbitrarily detained and often subjected to brutal treatment, sometimes including torture. Of these, hundreds have been \u201cdisappeared.\u201d The Ombudsman\u2019s Office of Colombia had reported 548 missing persons as of May 7. In Cali alone, human rights groups reported 206 missing persons as of May 20.<\/p> <p>The corpses of murdered protesters have begun to turn up in rivers, some showing signs of torture, others dismembered. In one particularly grisly instance, the severed head of a missing protester was found in a plastic bag. Other bodies have been found alongside abandoned roadways. Among those murdered was Beatriz Moreno Mosquera, a Buenaventura teacher and syndicalist, whose body was found bearing signs of torture.<\/p> <p>Even as it employs such gruesome and outright fascistic methods against the predominantly peaceful protests, the Duque administration is escalating state repression. Duque announced on May 28, which marks a month since the demonstrations began, a \u201cmaximum deployment\u201d of the military and police in the western province of Valle del Cauca and its capital Cali. Thirteen demonstrators were killed on that day alone in Cali.<\/p> <p>In employing the military and paramilitary forces, including for kidnappings and murder, the Colombian oligarchy is adopting the tactics of the decades-long US-backed counterinsurgency war during which hundreds of thousands of mostly peasants were killed and \u201cdisappeared.\u201d<\/p> <p>These methods of brute force and terror mark an escalation in the efforts to suppress protests involving millions of youths and workers against social inequality and the homicidal response of the government to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 88,000 lives in the country, according to official figures.<\/p> <p>Protests began on April 28, triggered by a proposed tax reform which would shift the burden of the pandemic onto poor and working-class Colombians while protecting the wealth of the country\u2019s oligarchy, who form the main constituency of the Duque regime.<\/p> <p>Although the tax reform was ultimately withdrawn in the face of the growing unrest, the demonstrations quickly escalated into a generalized outpouring of anger against corruption, police brutality and the government\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other longstanding social grievances. The protests grew to massive proportions, with as many as 15 million Colombians out of a population of 50 million taking part in demonstrations in one form or another.<\/p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch, there have been 63 \u201ccredible\u201d reports of deaths since the start of the protests, which is higher than the 45 deaths reported by the Colombian Ministry of Defense. The majority of the dead have been gunned down with live ammunition by the National Police, the Mobile Anti-Disturbance Squadron (ESMAD) and fascistic paramilitary forces who work in concert with the security forces.<\/p> <p>Many thousands have been injured. One favored tactic of the security forces has been aiming \u201cnonlethal\u201d projectiles at the faces of protesters, often causing severe injuries, including blindness. The NGO Temblores reports at least 46 protesters with eye mutilations as of May 20.<\/p> <p>In addition, at least 22 women have reported being sexually assaulted at the hands of the police. In the city of Popay\u00e1n, a 17-year-old girl committed suicide after she denounced the ESMAD officials, who had detained her, of sexual assault. This triggered angry protests and the burning down of the local police jail.<\/p> <p>The bourgeois press in Colombia has imposed an unofficial blackout on the protests to cover up the crimes of the state. The government has also taken to cutting off power and internet access to targeted areas, allowing their forces to move in and commit atrocities under cover of darkness.<\/p> <p>The bloody details of the repression have nevertheless been captured on hundreds of cellphone videos that have been uploaded to social media. One video uploaded to Twitter shows a block of working-class homes going up in flames, apparently after police fired tear gas canisters into the buildings. In another instance, police fired tear gas into a hospital.<\/p> <p>The ruling capitalist oligarchy is seeking to defend its wealth and privileges at any cost. The vicious repression meted out by the state, on the one hand, and the desperate anger fueling the protests, on the other, reflect the enormous social tensions that exist within this deeply unequal country, in which 42.5 percent of the population live below the poverty line.<\/p> <p>VICE interviewed a doctor who runs a makeshift clinic in Cali that provides medical aid to protesters wounded by police. In reference to the Cali youths who have formed defensive groups to confront the police, known as the Front Line, he said, \u201cThe people putting themselves on the line are the people who have nothing. They feel that since they already have nothing, there\u2019s nothing they can take away from them.\u201d<\/p> <p>One of these Front Line youths told VICE, \u201cWe\u2019re young people who removed our blindfolds and can now see the truth. We\u2019re sick of the lack of opportunity, of the inequality, of this society of rich people that sees us as delinquents because we rebelled and decided to act against this situation.\u201d<\/p> <p>The heroic determination of the Colombian workers and youth in the face of deadly state repression stands in stark contrast to the duplicity and cowardice of those claiming to represent them. The major trade unions and the pseudo-left organizations, organized in a \u201cNational Strike Committee,\u201d have been involved in talks with the Duque regime in an effort to bring an end to the protests. The Catholic Church and the UN are also involved.<\/p> <p>The National Strike Committee\u2019s demands have focused on reformist measures such as the dismantling of the ESMAD, greater opportunities for students and a basic income. This promotion of illusions in half-measures is meant to distract workers from the irreconcilable class conflict that lies at the heart of Colombian capitalism. The Committee has also carefully avoided mobilizing workers in key industries, thereby deliberately isolating the protest movement.<\/p> <p>By their actions, the trade unions and the pseudo-left\u2014representing sections of the affluent middle class\u2014whatever their rhetoric, demonstrate that they serve as auxiliaries of the Colombian state in protecting the interests of the oligarchy and its US imperialist sponsors.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3ZG552ORAOJJKZR100FOP88KBEH2VC"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":574,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2021.0","month":"April","date":"28.0","city":"Cali","region":"None","country":"Columbia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Columbia, protesters, activists, rape, torture, murder, class-warfare","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2021.0","month":"April","date":"28.0","city":"Cali","region":"None","country":"Columbia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Columbia, protesters, activists, rape, torture, murder, class-warfare","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1002501055,"Input.title":"U.S. sanctions Iranians over alleged plot to kidnap NY-based journalist","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-04 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Iranian American journalist Alinejad Masih shows an FBI car guarding outside her apartment in this still image from an undated social media video posted on (Photo : Twitter\/@ALINEJADMASIH via REUTERS\/File Photo)<\/p> <p>The United States has sanctioned four Iranian intelligence operatives behind a failed plot to kidnap a U.S. journalist and human rights activist, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Friday.<\/p> <p>The sanctions come after U.S. prosecutors in July charged the four with plotting to kidnap the New York-based journalist who was critical of Tehran.

Presented for the first time in 2012, the technique has allowed to revolutionize research in the Life Sciences, bringing it into a new era, and has so far helped to open new avenues for the treatment of many diseases, from some forms of cancer to cystic fibrosis, to the point of approaching the dream of curing hereditary diseases\u00bb.<\/p> <p>The Italian news agency adds, unbalancing on \u201cfuturistic\u201d therapies but omitting the fundamental detail that precisely this sophisticated biochemical technique was experimented by the American Doudna on human embryos and this opened the doors to the chilling experiments of a researcher who in 2018 gave birth in China the first newborns with modified DNA. That experiment ignited a bitter debate within the scientific community precisely in relation to the limits not yet drawn by the nations regarding genetic manipulation.<\/p> <p>Researchers Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna<\/p> <p>Lula and Nana, this is the name given to the girls, were considered the first transhuman creatures and their \u201cscientific father\u201d He Jiankui, the Chinese doctor of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen who announced the birth of the twins with DNA modified to obtain immunization from HIV, in December 2019 he was sentenced by the court of Shenzhen to three years in prison for illegal medical practice and fined 3 million yuan, equal to about 430 thousand dollars.<\/p> <p>Little thing compared to the acquired worldwide fame and the announcements of the Chinese authorities who had promised \u201cserious punishment\u201d for the geneticist, blaming the results of his unauthorized experiment as \u201cbad science\u201d.<\/p> <p>As illustrated in a substantial investigation then carried out by Gospa News on the affair, we dedicated a large paragraph to the two researchers who are now awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Emmanuelle Charpentier, born in 1968 in Juvisy-sur-Orge, completed her studies at the Pasteur Institute and currently works in Berlin, Germany, where she directs the Max Planck Unit Institute for Pathogen Sciences. Jennifer A. Doudna was born in 1964 in Washington and, after studying at Harvard University, moved to the University of California at Berkeley, where she currently works.<\/p> <p>In that dossier which also analyzed the phenomenon of so-called Transhumanism, that is the scientific culture aimed at building super-human and financed by many Silicon Valley gurus, we highlighted that Doudna himself boasted in the scientific conferences of 2015 and a year later on the BBC to have grasped the potential of Crispr Cas9 in the modification of the genome not only of various organisms such as Bread Yeast, Zebra Fish, Fruit Fly, Plants, Mice, Monkeys but also of Human Embryos.<\/p> <p>Precisely for this reason, if the Chinese geneticist convicted of manipulating the DNA of the two girls can be considered the \u201cscientific father\u201d, the biochemists today awarded one of the most coveted world awards may well be considered the \u201ctechnological stepmothers\u201d of the transhuman twins, although not having participated in the aberrant childbirth, son of the genetic editing they created.<\/p> <p>The discovery of Crispr occurred almost by chance starting from Charpentier\u2019s research on the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, responsible for inflammation in humans, in particular with the discovery of a fragment of the genetic heritage used by the bacterium as a weapon to fight viruses.<\/p> <p>In the same year of the discovery, 2011, Charpentier began to collaborate with Jennifer Doudna to reconstruct the bacterium\u2019s weapon in a test tube, in order to simplify it, transforming it into an easier to use tool. In just one year, the two researchers obtained molecular scissors capable of cutting the molecule of life, the DNA, and of doing it with precision, in a specific site in order to rewrite the code of life.<\/p> <p>TWINS WITH MODIFIED DNA: FEAR OF ALTERED BRAINS<\/p> <p>Since 2012 the Crispr \/ Cas9 technique has been used all over the world, in a real explosion of applications. Including the shocking one for the birth of Lula and Nana adopted by the Chinese geneticist He Jiankui who, as reported by the Xinhua news agency, was found guilty of \u201cillegally carrying out genetic manipulation of embryos for reproductive purposes\u201d.<\/p> <p>Chinese physician He Jankui is the main protagonist at the Hong Kong University International Summit on Human Genome Editing in 2018<\/p> <p>He Jankui defended himself from the accusations by claiming to have altered the genes of the twin daughters of an HIV-positive father in order to make them immune to the HIV virus, but the experiment does not seem to have achieved the desired results.<\/p> <p>\u00abTo raise new doubts about the genetic mutation were recently some geneticists from Berkeley (USA), arguing in a study published in Nature Medecine that the DNA cut-and-sew technique, in addition to not guaranteeing the desired effects, would lead to a mortality risk greater than 21%\u00bb wrote Italian newspaper Repubblica at the time.<\/p> <p>The Asian scientist explained that he had \u201csilenced\u201d the cellular receptor CCR5, to which the AIDS virus binds, with the aim of obtaining genetic resistance to the HIV virus and, in the future, to switch to smallpox and cholera. Beyond the genetic mess and the controversy aroused in the world of medical science for the ethical implications, it was the magazine Mit Technology Review of the homonymous institute in Boston, to anticipate sensational revelations, as reported by Gospa News.<\/p> <p>\u00abNew research shows that the same alteration introduced in the DNA of the girls, the deletion of a gene called CCR5, not only makes the mice smarter but also improves the recovery of the human brain after stroke, and could be linked to a greater success at school\u00bb wrote Antonio Regalado, senior editor of biomedicine in the journal MIT Technology Review, hypothesising that genetic manipulation could improve cognition and memory.<\/p> <p>As detailed in our previous article, the science journalist highlighted a study conducted by Alcino J. Silva, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who in commenting on the case of the twins was resolute: \u00abSimple is that those mutations will likely have an impact on cognitive function in the twins\u00bb. But since, according to the same doctor interviewed, the \u00abexact effect on cognition is impossible to predict, this is why it should not have been done\u00bb.<\/p> <p>This is why, in the face of an unexplored world that can drag scientific research into the hell of Transhumanism, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry could have been destined for other protagonists in order to avoid incensing the \u201cstepmothers of Frankenstein\u2019s daughters\u201d who, despite not having had active part in the experiment, they inspired it through research on human embryos.<\/p> <p>Rewarding them instead means wanting to clear progress at any cost at the expense of any bio-ethical consideration. But as explained in the previous report, the financiers of transhumanist theories are among the most powerful and richest on earth\u2026<\/p> <p>It therefore becomes easy to compare these very dangerous chemical experiments to the bacteriological ones on the SARS virus infected with HIV conducted in Wuhan and financed by the European Commission and the American government agency USAID, instrument of the Central Intelligence Agency, and by the foundation of Bill Gates, many years before the SARS-COV-2 pandemic devastated the world with its high contagiousness.<\/p> <p>The variable lethality of Covid-19, as demonstrated in our 21 WuhanGates investigations, was in fact attributed by various virology and bioengineering experts to the characteristics of a gently modified organism in the laboratory, as claimed by former British counterintelligence director MI 6, Richard Dearlove, by human rights lawyer Robert F. Kennedy jr, and ultimately by Hong Kong researcher who fled to the US and now protected by the FBI, Li-Meng Yan.<\/p> <p>Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio<\/p> <p> COPYRIGHT GOSPA NEWS<\/p> <p>no reproduction without authorization \u2013 Versione originale in Italiano<\/p> <p>MAIN SOURCES<\/p> <p>GOSPA NEWS \u2013 WUHAN.GATES REPORTS<\/p> <p>GOSPA NEWS \u2013 CORONA VIRUS DOSSIER<\/p> <p>GOSPA NEWS \u2013 LIFE \u2013 BIOETHICS \u2013 TRANSHUMANISM<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3UL5XDRDNEYD8KEBAQ6CV1ROKQ758B"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":802,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2019.0","month":"December","date":null,"city":"Shenzhen","region":"None","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"He Jankui","victim_keywords":"CRISPR, AIDS, immunity, twins, gene editing, arrested, transhumanism","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2019.0","month":"December","date":null,"city":"Shenzhen","region":"None","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"He Jankui","victim_keywords":"CRISPR, AIDS, immunity, twins, gene editing, arrested, transhumanism","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":895514516,"Input.title":"Morocco: Free Outspoken Journalist Jailed Over Tweet","Input.publish_date":"2019-12-28 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Click to expand Image Journalist Omar Radi in Casablanca, Morocco, 2018.

Omar Radi, 33, is due to be tried on January 2, 2020 for allegedly insulting a judge who imposed heavy penalties on protesters from the Rif region. He faces up to one year in prison if convicted.<\/p> <p>On December 26, a judge in Casablanca rejected Radi\u2019s request for pretrial release, notably on medical grounds that he suffers a severe form of asthma and other ailments.<\/p> <p>\u201cCriticizing officials is protected speech and no one should face prison time for peacefully doing so,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cMoroccan authorities should immediately free Omar Radi and drop their case against him, which reeks of political vengeance against his critical journalism and activism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Radi, an award-winning investigative journalist, published several articles about the corruption of officials, and collaborated with various international media as a local correspondent or stringer. Radi is also a social and economic rights activist who has been active in various nongovernmental organizations, notably defending freedom of the press and land rights. He was vice president of Attac Maroc, the local branch of an anti-globalization organization that promotes civic action in response to perceived excesses of global capitalism. He recently described to the Committee to Protect Journalists the \u201cclimate of pervasive surveillance and harassment\u201d faced by Moroccan journalists.<\/p> <p>On April 6, Radi tweeted \u201cLet us all remember Appeals Judge Lahcen Tolfi, the enforcer against our brothers. In many regimes, small-time henchmen like him come back begging, later, claiming they were only \u2018carrying out orders.\u2019 No forgetting or forgiveness with such undignified officials!\u201d Radi tweeted this minutes after an appeals court, presided by Tolfi, upheld the trial court\u2019s verdicts against the leaders of largely peaceful protests in the Rif region, who were sentenced in June 2018 to up to 20 years in prison, largely based on statements that they said were made under police torture.<\/p> <p>On April 16, police in Casablanca summoned Radi and interrogated him for four hours about a series of tweets he posted, criticizing a magazine feature profiling Judge Tolfi that Radi found overly favorable. The police did not contact Radi again until December 25, when they sent him a new summons. When he reported the next morning at 9 a.m., the police transported him to the office of a prosecutor in the Ain Sebaa Court in Casablanca. At 1 p.m., the prosecutor began questioning Radi in the company of his four lawyers. One of them, Omar Bendjelloun, told Human Rights Watch that the 30-minute session revolved solely around the single April 6 tweet about Judge Tolfi. At around 2 p.m., the prosecutor charged Radi with \u201cinsulting a magistrate\u201d under penal code article 263 and ordered his detention and immediate referral to trial. Radi was taken to a cell in the basement of the courthouse. His trial started at 6 p.m. Human Rights Watch attended the trial session.<\/p> <p>The defense immediately requested a postponement of the case and Radi\u2019s provisional release. The prosecutor argued that detention was necessary because of unspecified \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that he said surrounded Radi\u2019s case. The judge rejected the petition for provisional release and ordered Radi\u2019s transfer to Oukacha prison in Casablanca.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors state compliance with the ICCPR, stated in its general comment on the right to freedom of expression that the \u201cmere fact that forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify the imposition of penalties.\u201d Thus, \u201call public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority \u2026 are legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition.\u201d<\/p> <p>In the past two months, Morocco has arrested, jailed, or sentenced a rapper, two YouTube commentators, and a student who posted the lyrics of a critical rap song on Facebook.

Here is why the plan is part of an older strategy to clamp down on the internet and why its claims that this is about cybercrime - rather than censorship - are not convincing.<\/p> <p>The strategy<\/p> <p>The document released by the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) seeks to set up a National Digital Ethics Committee (NDEC) with an enforcement unit empowered to take down and censor social media posts. To make its plan work, the document proposes allowing the government to set up a proxy \"to segregate from all incoming and outgoing internet traffic in Mauritius, social media traffic, which will then need to be decrypted, re-encrypted and archived for inspection purposes as and when required\".<\/p> <p>The plan, the document argues, will help fight cybercrime in social media by allowing the government to retain a record of social media posts and track down who posted them. Governments wanting a measure of control over new communication platforms is nothing new.<\/p> <p>Back in the early 1990s, the US government wanted telecom firms to allow them to eavesdrop on mobile phones by inserting chips in them accessible to law enforcement in the name of national security. By 1996, that plan was abandoned.<\/p> <p>Now its social media and governments across the globe have generally looked to three strategies of trying to control social media. The first is by simply blocking off social media sites (or the internet entirely).<\/p> <p>This has been done in states such as Uganda, Congo-Brazzaville and Chad (particularly during elections or times of unrest). But it's not just Africa that's guilty of that; according to the Internet Shutdown Tracker, India shut down the internet at various parts of the country no less than 106 times just in 2019, topping the global list in internet shutdowns.<\/p> <p>Pressure social media companies<\/p> <p>The second strategy is to pressure social media companies themselves to censor at the behest of governments. In 2018 Germany introduced a law mandating social media firms to take down illegal content within 24 hours, as did Australia in April 2019. The European Union is currently in the midst of harmonizing laws across its member-states to tackle copyright infringement on social media. In January this year, Russia passed a law forcing social media companies to censor content deemed illegal by the government.<\/p> <p>The third approach is to set up regulatory agencies to curb social media, this is the case in the UK, France and India, each of which is in the midst of setting up such bodies.<\/p> <p>What the ICTA is proposing falls within this latter category of strategies. But it goes further, the proposal allow ICTA itself to take down social media posts. \"In other states the debate on this is still raging and has been for years, so how can Mauritius just decide in 20 days, the middle of a pandemic, on how best to regulate social media?\" asks Rajen Narsinghen, senior legal lecturer at the University of Mauritius.<\/p> <p>Except of course, that the idea of giving the government the power to decide what does, or does not, appear on social media is not as new as all that.<\/p> <p>Old wine, new document<\/p> <p>The ICTA document is neither new nor shocking. But rather just the latest attempt in a long-term effort by the government to clamp down on social media. Starting in 2017, the government toyed with the idea of giving itself the power to ban websites and social media posts by amending current Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act (CMCA).<\/p> <p>The drafting instructions to the Attorney General's Office were even put up on the ICT Ministry's website. The rationale was to clamp down on fake news online. The problem was that the plan was derailed after the Law Reform Commission in September 2018 rejected the idea.<\/p> <p>While it called for tightening specific laws dealing with specific cybercrimes, regarding giving the power to the government to determine what and what was not fake news (and what could be published online) it had this to say; \"The main danger to enact such legislation is that it poses a threat to freedom of expression, as it can be used, among other things, to gag dissenting voices. Indeed, decreeing a legal duty of \"truth\" would create a dangerous instrument of control journalistic activities; allowing public officials to decide what amounts to truth is equivalent to accepting that the forces in power have a right to silence views they disagree with, or beliefs that they do not share.\"<\/p> <p>The LRC has reason to be wary. In June that same year, the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that, \"Encryption establishes, among other things, a measure of privacy that enables individuals to search the web, develop opinions and access information online. It may secure the traffic of emails, instant messages and other modes of digital communication so that individuals may express themselves freely\".<\/p> <p>Any interference in such communications, the UN added, should only be done on a case-by-case basis and only when ordered by a court. A far cry from the blanket powers the ICTA is looking to give itself now.<\/p> <p>In 2018, the government had to settle for watering down the provisions of the Information and Communication Technologies Act by amending it by widening what constituted a cybercrime ('causing distress') and reversing the burden of proof on those posting online to prove their innocence making prosecuting cybercrimes easier.<\/p> <p>This is to say that ICTA's latest proposals are just another episode in the ever-tightening grip of the government over social media.<\/p> <p>ICTA's credibility<\/p> <p>One of the biggest problems with the ICTA's proposals is that the regulator has precious little credibility when it comes to deciding what is, and is not, cybercrime and prosecuting it. In the Rachna Seenauth case in April last year, for example, the secretary of an ex-President was arrested for sharing a joke on social media poking fun at Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth.<\/p> <p>That was on a complaint by Kaushik Jadunundun, then a politically appointed board member of ICTA who boasted on Facebook that he did it \"for my boss and my country\". That was before Jadunundun himself was arrested and forced to leave the ICTA, board after he himself was accused of defamatory posts. Seenauth's affidavit notes that she received a message from Dick Ng Sui Wa, the Chairman of ICTA telling her that her post was \"not alright\".<\/p> <p>Also arrested last year for poking fun at the prime minister was ex-ambassador Ravin Lochun. There is an irony here, the government that now looks to squeeze out fake news, itself benefited from doctored videos in the last election campaign and a vast social media campaign against its opponents. \"There are double standards here,\" says Narsinghen.<\/p> <p>Is it about law and order?<\/p> <p>ICTA reassured everybody in a communique yesterday that its proposals would only affect public messaging platforms such as Facebook. In its consultation document it listed statistics about cybercrime: 2,051 incidents reported between January 2020 and January 2021.<\/p> <p>One reason these proposals are necessary, ICTA insisted was because, \"in Mauritius, when offensive and abusive online content is posted in the native Kreol language, in the majority of cases, complaints made by local authorities to the social media administrators remain unattended or are not addressed in a timely manner.\" In other words, social media companies are unwilling or unable to help stamp out cybercrime on social, forcing ICTA to give itself the power to do so.<\/p> <p>But how much of this is about cybercrime really? What kind of requests about cybercrime from the Mauritian government have these social media companies been ignoring? Luckily, they too publish figures.<\/p> <p>According to Google's Transparency Report, since 2016 it has received 13 requests from Mauritius, eight of which were from the government, to take down 29 web pages, out of which no less than 20 were for allegedly criticizing the government or for defaming government figures. Only one had anything to do with actual cybercrime, in this case, copyright infringement. Six of these were videos on social media.<\/p> <p>Posts criticizing the government<\/p> <p>Let's take Facebook. According to its own reports, between 2017 and 2019 the Mauritian government demanded information on seven user accounts. Once again, for posts criticizing the government or government figures. None of these requests were honored. At least according to Google and Facebook.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mauritius Media By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Or Wakashio, without social media nobody would have known what was going on and civil society would not have been mobilized\".<\/p> <p>For him the dangers are clear: \"For six years now the government has been making it harder to fight controversial building projects impacting the environment, leaving recourse only to the Supreme Court\". He adds that the decision to de-proclaim Pomponette beach has been going since 2016 at court and may only now start formal hearings. \"Social media is one of the key tools left for environmental rights, which have been shrinking in recent years, we need it to raise consciousness and to communicate with outside bodies and other environment NGOs. They are opening the door to something dangerous here\".<\/p> <p>This ICTA proposal is appearing after 2020 saw the government face a series of social media-fuelled protests over its mishandling of Covid-19, Wakashio and the Kistnen case. This is the key context here.<\/p> <p>The problem is that the government can easily transform ICTA's proposals into reality. The ICTA proposal says simply it can all be done by amending its enabling legislation. \"They can pass it as an ordinary bill, so they just need a simple majority in parliament, which they have\" argues Narsinghen,<\/p> <p>\"Of course given its implications it can be challenged in court for breaching constitutional protections to freedom or expression and the right to privacy\". In lieu of a lengthy court case and a lockdown, ironically, the only way to challenge ICTA's proposals is online. Precisely the type of activity the proposals from ICTA are putting in peril.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3IZVJEBJ6CZOBKFCOZGU0R2SFWT6Z5"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":756,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021","month":"April","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mauritius","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"private citizens, jounalists, internet users, social media, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ravin Lochu","victim_keywords":"ex-ambassador, joke, internet post","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kaushik Jadunundun","victim_keywords":"ICTA board member, Mauritius","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Rachna Seenauth","victim_keywords":"secretary of an ex-President, joke, social media, Pime Minister","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021","month":"April","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Mauritius","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"private citizens, jounalists, internet users, social media, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","insufficient information","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ravin Lochu","victim_keywords":"ex-ambassador, joke, internet post","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kaushik Jadunundun","victim_keywords":"ICTA board member, Mauritius","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Rachna Seenauth","victim_keywords":"secretary of an ex-President, joke, social media, Pime Minister","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":920145211,"Input.title":"Saudi Arabia abolishes flogging as a form of punishment","Input.publish_date":"2020-04-25 11:35:39","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia says flogging as a form of punishment has been abolished in the kingdom.<\/p> <p>The country\u2019s supreme court said the move is part of efforts to bring the kingdom into line with international human rights norms, according to RTE.<\/p> <p>The court said the reform is being undertaken by King Salman and Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and his son.<\/p> <p>It said floggings would now be replaced with fines and jail terms.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Before now, the courts could order the flogging of an individual who has been convicted of an offence.<\/p> <p>A recent high-profile instance of flogging was the case of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi who was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes in 2014 for \u201cinsulting\u201d Islam.<\/p> <p>Saudi Arabia has been largely criticised for abusing human rights.

The kidnapping narrative shares many similarities with their preferred telling of January 6, not the least of which is that alleged militias incited by Trump attempted to carry out a domestic terror attack.<\/p> <p>Despite wall-to-wall coverage after the charges in the Michigan case were announced right before Election Day, the corporate media has almost completely memory-holed the abduction caper. Stewart Rhodes is a household name; Stephen Robeson, a convicted felon and the chief FBI informant in the Whitmer case accused of all sorts of malfeasance, is not.<\/p> <p>The reason, of course, is that exposing how the FBI set a trap to lure down-on-their-luck men\u2014one of the codefendants referred to Adam Fox, the alleged plot leader, as \u201cCaptain Autism\u201d\u2014into their kidnapping ruse would run afoul of the media\u2019s insistence that the government had nothing to do with the events of January 6, despite plenty of proof that hundreds of FBI agents and informants were involved before and during the Capitol protest. (A top FBI official recently refused under oath to say whether FBI agents or assets engaged in or incited violent criminal behavior on January 6.)<\/p> <p>Perhaps the media considers it a mere coincidence that the head of the FBI Detroit field office overseeing the Whitmer plot was promoted to head of the FBI Washington, D.C. field office several weeks before January 6?<\/p> <p>Defense attorneys in the Whitmer case are making a strong case for FBI entrapment, detailing egregious misconduct by the agency, and asking a judge to dismiss the charges. At least a dozen FBI agents and confidential human sources orchestrated the kidnapping scheme; defense attorneys claim the feds \u201cactively planned and coordinated its efforts to induce the defendants to engage in incriminating behavior and statements, even going so far as designing the objective and structural components of the [kidnapping] conspiracy.\u201d<\/p> <p>In a stunning move, defense lawyers now want prosecutors to offer immunity not to their clients but to FBI agents and informants. A new defense filing took the rare step of asking the judge to order the Justice Department to offer \u201cuse immunity\u201d to every FBI asset involved in the plot. Fearing they will invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in court, defense attorneys are attempting to compel testimony that would be immune from prosecution, except charges of perjury.<\/p> <p>John Kiyonaga, a D.C. criminal defense attorney representing a few January 6 defendants, told me over the weekend that the request is \u201cmind blowingly rare.\u201d<\/p> <p>Prosecutors are desperate to conceal the FBI\u2019s animating, and likely criminal, role in the Whitmer plot. The Justice Department notified the court in December that three of the top FBI agents on the case\u2014including Richard Trask, the FBI investigator who signed the criminal complaint against the federal defendants in October 2020\u2014have been removed from the government\u2019s witness list. (The trial is set for March 8.)<\/p> <p>Trask, in fact, was fired by the FBI\u2014a near-impossible feat\u2014after he was arrested for assaulting his wife in a drunken rage following a swingers party last summer. Reporters also discovered several anti-Trump tirades posted on Trask\u2019s social media accounts.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe investigation in this case was based primarily on the efforts of FBI agents and confidential human sources,\u201d wrote Scott Graham, the attorney representing Kaleb Frank, one of five men facing conspiracy to kidnap charges, punishable by a life sentence. \u201cNormally, these people would testify at trial and would answer relevant questions posed by both sides to the case. The entrapment defense directed at both groups would be argued by the parties and decided by the jury. This case, however, is different from most. It is now apparent that a number of both the agents and sources have reason to refuse to testify by invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.\u201d<\/p> <p>Prosecutors also don\u2019t plan to call on Stephen Robeson, the informant who coordinated every surveillance and training trip related to the caper. Not only has Robeson been charged with committing at least two crimes while working the Whitmer plot, the Justice Department accuses him (implausibly) of acting as a \u201cdouble agent.\u201d<\/p> <p>Defense attorneys aren\u2019t buying the government\u2019s latest excuse to keep Robeson, a longtime FBI source, off the witness stand. Robeson\u2019s testimony, the defense argues, \u201cwill establish repeated violations of FBI policies in handling [informants], making it both exculpatory and essential.\u201d<\/p> <p>The defense also wants to show the jury at least 258 examples of recordings and communications between the informants and their FBI handlers to show how the agency directed every aspect of the attempted kidnapping. Prosecutors claim the statements are \u201chearsay\u201d and don\u2019t want jurors to see them.<\/p> <p>So, what would their unvarnished testimony and captured communications likely reveal? That without the elaborate involvement of the FBI, which compensated the lead informant at least $50,000 for six months\u2019 work and funded every outing to produce photographic evidence of the defendants\u2019 participation in weapons training camps and reconnaissance missions, the plot never would have made it past idle chatter.<\/p> <p>It likely would show how the FBI infiltrated alleged \u201cmilitia groups\u201d and even lured people into those groups beginning in early 2020 under the guise of monitoring potentially violent anti-lockdown rallies.<\/p> <p>Evidence would expose how a lockdown rally at the Michigan Capitol building in April 2020 acted as a dress rehearsal for January 6, and how the FBI steered the defendants from more lockdown protests to the kidnapping plot.<\/p> <p>The jury also would hear how Stephen D\u2019Antuono, the director of the FBI\u2019s Detroit field office, handled his agents executing the caper and how he was swiftly rewarded for his work. After his office successfully produced damaging headlines for Donald Trump right before the election, D\u2019Antuono was promoted to head of the FBI\u2019s D.C. office just three months before the Capitol protest.<\/p> <p>Unsurprisingly, prosecutors have already told the defense that they have no intention of offering immunity to their now-tarnished star government witnesses. It\u2019s unlikely a judge will avoid interfering in what is the sole purview of the Justice Department to offer immunity deals.<\/p> <p>But watching these FBI agents and informants repeatedly plead the Fifth on the stand may be as revealing as any protected testimony.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3INZSNUD8258Q2CEUOU9T9ARHFR9DK"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":757,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2020","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Michigan","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Whitmer plot, Michigan","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2020","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Michigan","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Whitmer plot, Michigan","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":874320803,"Input.title":"Greek police arrest man suspected of 1985 TWA hijacking","Input.publish_date":"2019-09-21 15:46:37+01:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>A Lebanese man accused of involvement in the hijacking of a TWA plane and the murder of a US navy diver has been arrested in Greece, police said on Saturday.<\/p> <p>The 65-year-old was spotted by policemen in the island of Mykonos and detained on Thursday, a statement said.<\/p> <p>Greek authorities said there was a European arrest warrant issued by Germany for the hijacking as well as a kidnapping committed in 1987.<\/p> <p>Pilot John Testrake, right, was forced to fly his jet across the Mediterranean after it was hijacked in Athens in June 1985<\/p> <p>Greek police said they have arrested one of the men suspected of involvement in the hijacking<\/p> <p>TWA Flight 847 was hijacked in Athens on June 14, 1985 by Hezbollah The jet was held for 17 days and forced to fly across the Mediterranean four times<\/p> <p>US Navy diver Robert Stethem, pictured, was badly beaten and shot in the back of the head and dumped on the tarmac in Beirut on the second day of the hijack<\/p> <p>Greek media said he was involved in June 14, 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847 and the murder of an American passenger.<\/p> <p>He was also wanted in connection with a 1987 kidnapping crime, possibly related to his release in return for the freeing of two German citizens held hostage by his accomplices in Lebanon, the source said.<\/p> <p>The TWA 847 flight from Cairo to San Diego with stops in Athens, Rome, Boston, and Los Angeles was hijacked shortly after taking off from Athens in 1985.<\/p> <p>The hijackers demanded the release of Shi'ite Muslim prisoners from Israeli custody.<\/p> <p>Those on board endured a three-day intercontinental ordeal with TWA pilot John Testrake being forced to crisscross the Mediterranean with his 153 passengers and crew members, from Beirut to Algiers and back again, landing in Beirut three times before he was finally allowed to stop.<\/p> <p>Some passengers were beaten and a U.S. Navy diver, Robert Stethem who was on board the aircraft was beaten and murdered.

Special Procedures, which consists of special rapporteurs and expert working groups.<\/p> <p>The rights group calls the liuzhi system a \u201clegalized system for disappearance.\u201d<\/p> <p>The rights group\u2019s concerns center around the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) choosing to work with the Chinese agency behind the liuzhi system, the National Supervision Commission (NSC). The two signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in October 2019.<\/p> <p>Since then, the NSC has subjected at least 28,983 victims to the liuzhi system, according to estimates by the rights group. During that same time span, the Chinese regime has only confirmed to have placed 5,909 people under the system.<\/p> <p>The rights group also estimated that a minimum average of 16 to 76 people is subjected to the liuzhi system every day.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe NSC is responsible for widespread and systematic acts of enforced disappearance, torture, and other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health, gross human rights violations that have all been reported to the United Nations,\u201d the rights group stated.<\/p> <p>There are limited details of the agreement, except that the two sides would work in areas including information sharing on corruption prevention and fugitive repatriation. As a result, Safeguard Defenders stated that it has asked the UNODC to release the full contents of the MOU, but its request has been denied.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf 28,983 people [arbitrarily] detained, disappeared and [tortured] since signing the MOU is not enough for the UNODC to realize NSC is not a suitable partner, let alone develop deeper cooperation with, [what would be]?\u201d Safeguard Defenders asked.<\/p> <p>The NSC, a non-judicial organ, is a supersized anti-corruption agency established by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in March 2018. It\u2019s tasked with investigating economic crimes committed by business people, party members, and employees at state-run institutions.<\/p> <p>The NSC holds enormous power, including the ability to issue warrants, freeze assets, summon suspects, and hold suspects for at least six months in the liuzhi system, where they\u2019re denied access to their family or a lawyer.<\/p> <p>Laura Harth, campaign director for Safeguard Defenders, said that U.N. agencies are all \u201cbound to the fundamental human rights contained in the human rights treaties and conventions,\u201d which prohibits arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, tortures, and absence of access to legal representation.<\/p> <p>\u201cYet, in signing an MOU and recognizing the extrajudicial body NSC as the legitimate representative of the Chinese Government for the scope of the Convention Against Corruption, UNODC completely derogates from its obligations in this regard,\u201d Harth said in an email to The Epoch Times.<\/p> <p>She noted that suspects could be held under liuzhi for more than six months.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe sole purpose for the time inside\u2014up to six months\u2014is to produce a confession, and a suspect will likely remain for as long as needed to secure such a confession,\u201d Harth said.<\/p> <p>In May 2018, less than two months after the NSC was established, the first known death in the liuzhi system was reported. Citing China\u2019s state-run media Caixin, Safeguard Defenders reported that the dead man was Chen Yong, who was held in liuzhi for 26 days before his death. Chen was a driver for a local official who was a suspect in a corruption case.<\/p> <p>Chen\u2019s family saw his body, which was mangled and bruised, suggesting that he was \u201ctortured to death,\u201d according to the rights group (pdf).<\/p> <p>Another known detainee under the system was Meng Hongwei, former president of Interpol. He went missing after returning to China in September 2018, before the NSC released a statement confirming his detention the following month. In January 2020, Meng was sentenced to 13 years and six months in prison after he pleaded guilty to accepting more than $2 million in bribes.<\/p> <p>The MOU that the NSC signed with UNODC isn\u2019t the only one. According to the NSC\u2019s website, the commission also inked similar agreements with several countries, including Argentina, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt least for the NSC, signing of these MOU has effectively legitimized China\u2019s move of handing over judicial cooperation, and criminal investigations, to a non-judicial organ,\u201d Safeguard Defenders stated.<\/p> <p>Liuzhi isn\u2019t the only form of forced disappearance in China. The CCP also commits \u201cmass state-sanctioned kidnapping\u201d of its people and foreigners under a system called \u201cResidential Surveillance at a Designated Location\u201d (RSDL).

However, if handled incorrectly, images can cause more harm than good for your website. Some images are simply too cumbersome in size or data, which is why image compression plugins exist.<\/p> <p>These plugins pretty much tinker with your website\u2019s images to make them optimized. There are plenty of benefits for doing that but the primary ones would be to make them fit in better with your content and to stop them from slowing down your website. That is why they are necessary for most blogs since a blog without images is basically handicapping itself.<\/p> <p>So, in order to have the best of both worlds, image compression blogs exist. You can have your images and they won\u2019t slow down your website. These godsend packets of software can rescue your blog and server from damaging slowdowns and ghastly formatting. Here are the best image compression plugins for your blog.<\/p> <p>Here we are with one of the most popular options among image compression plugins, Smush. Aside from the cute and appropriate name, Smush just crushes most of the competition due to its generosity. It\u2019s a free plugin that also offers an all-in-one solution to most things pertaining to your images in WordPress.<\/p> <p>This can be lossless image compression, bulk compression, lazy loading, image resizing, and a lot more. Of course, one of Smush\u2019s best selling points is how it promises to leave the image quality intact despite the compression. Smush also gives you an unlimited allowance for its free version, though the catch is that this only applies for images 5 MB or below in data size.<\/p> <p>Another generous free option would be the aptly named Compress JPEG & PNG Images. This plugin is pretty straightforward and does what it\u2019s named after. Expect its functionality to be not as versatile as Smush, however. Still, because of that, it might be a lighter plugin or software for your website.<\/p> <p>In any case, Compress JPEG & PNG Images lets you automatically compress or optimize images on the fly as you upload them. You can even set a maximum custom upload size so you don\u2019t have to tinker with it every upload. The allowance is more or less generous, however, since Compress JPEG & PNG Images only allows you to optimize 100 images every month for the free option.<\/p> <p>Despite the comical name, EWWW Image Optimizer is the real deal when it comes to image compression plugins. Like the previous option above, it lets you optimize your images as you upload them. You can even use this to compress your previously uploaded images in bulk in case you want to fix some of your past errors for the older content.<\/p> <p>Compression is also performed on your own servers which eliminates the need for an account. Optionally, you can let EWWW Image Optimizer convert any image you have to a lighter and more optimized format. It\u2019s a free plugin as well and you\u2019ll only have to pay for premium if you want compression qualities higher than 80 percent.<\/p> <p>Like Compress JPEG & PNG Images, ShortPixel Image Optimizer only allows for 100 images per month if you\u2019re running on the free option. However, one of the most outstanding features for it is how upon installation and getting an API key, ShortPixel Image Optimizer immediately begins compressing images.<\/p> <p>It even has the courtesy to store your original images in a separate folder. This, in turn, allows you to do some comparisons on how this image compression plugin performs. The plugin even lets you choose how you compare the images and formats.<\/p> <p>reSmush.It has most of everything the other plugins in here have from bulk compression of older images to automatic upload compression. Of course, you can also choose levels and customize how the plugin resizes and compresses your images.<\/p> <p>In that regard, it\u2019s also similar to how Smush handles its free plan; reSmush.It only allows compression and optimization for images sized 5 MB or below. Anything higher and you\u2019ll have to avail of the premium plan. The plugin\u2019s developers are also proud of how they made the plugin simple and a breeze to use; you can start any operation in as little as two clicks.<\/p> <p>Imagify has one of the best user interfaces as far as image compression plugins go and also comes in a free option. Nevertheless, you might find Imagify\u2019s free plan more limiting as it calculates the allowance differently. Instead of limiting the number of images or the max image size, Imagify will give users a monthly limit of 25 MB total image data size.<\/p> <p>For this, you can have the same or similar functionalities as some of the top image compression plugins on this list. The plugin does allow you to restore some of the media it has compressed back to the original version quite easily.<\/p> <p>As for this final plugin, it doesn\u2019t exactly optimize or compress images directly. Instead, it uses the lazy load method; that is, it only displays the images which the website visitors only need to see. This frees a huge bandwidth for your servers and will certainly speed up your website. It decreases the number of requests needed when loading a page, thus improving the loading time.<\/p> <p>Lazy Load is pretty much a dedicated plugin to lazy loading. It\u2019s a great alternative to image compression or optimization especially if you run a photography website and don\u2019t want to tamper with the image quality. It\u2019s also free, like most of the plugins here so it\u2019s up to you which one appeals to your needs and wants best.<\/p> <p>First published in 2020; updated 2022<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"30IRMPJWD1YM88EAGMGIO75B780RK4"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1128,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"plug in for word press blog article","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"plug in for word press blog article","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":919410358,"Input.title":"Journalists publish new evidence of Russian mercenaries torturing and killing a Syrian deserter in 2017 \u2014 Meduza","Input.publish_date":"2020-04-21 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Warning: This story describes graphic violence.<\/p> <p>The newspaper Novaya Gazeta has published two new videos corroborating the brutal torture and murder of a man in Syria.

He told reporters on Monday he might not be allowed to stay with his family for long, even though his wife is gravely ill.<\/p> <p>Wang was arrested without due process during a vicious persecution of human rights lawyers and democracy activists known as the 709 Crackdown, because it began on July 9, 2015.

He was convicted of \u201csubverting state power\u201d in January 2019, probably because he offered legal representation to members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, and \u201csentenced to four years and six months in prison, and deprived of political rights for five years,\u201d according to the court statement. He was finally allowed to see his family in prison for the first time in June 2019, four years after the CCP made him disappear.<\/p> <p>Amnesty International declared Wang a \u201cprisoner of conscience\u201d who was \u201cat risk of torture and other ill-treatment,\u201d unsuccessfully demanding his immediate release. Human Rights Watch noted that Wang\u2019s detention and the constant official harassment of his family violated both Chinese and international law.<\/p> <p>Persistent reports circulated that Wang was tortured with electric shocks during his detention.

When the \u201cquarantine\u201d was finally lifted, he was told he was not allowed to travel to Beijing. His movements remained restricted to short shopping trips around Jinan, and friends said they feared they would be \u201cquarantined\u201d as well if they went to visit him.<\/p> <p>The U.S. State Department denounced the continuing persecution of Wang Quanzhang last week and demanded he be allowed to rejoin his family in Beijing. When Wang learned his wife Li Wenzu was suffering from severe abdominal pain, he defied the police and tried to take a taxi to Beijing. He was seized by masked plainclothes police officers when his taxi reached the highway and detained for a while, but eventually allowed to complete his journey to Beijing.<\/p> <p>Radio Free Asia (RFA) described the emotional reunion between Wang, Li, and their seven-year-old son:<\/p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve dreamed of us being reunited during the past five years,\u201d his wife Li Wenzu said as the couple hugged. \u201cNow it feels as if I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d \u201cDad, we\u2019re having dumplings this evening,\u201d the couple\u2019s young son Wang Guangwei told his father in a video made available by the family via social media. \u201cGreat, can I have a hug now?\u201d Wang replied, before sitting with his arms around his wife and child on the family sofa.<\/p> <p>In a videotaped recording of the family union, Wang said he felt as though he has awakened from a trance and said it took him five years to realize his dream of once more holding his wife and child. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be apart again, will we?\u201d Li asked him.<\/p> <p>Li has been hospitalized for her abdominal pain and may soon require surgery for appendicitis, according to a friend of the family, who added she has \u201cbeen under constant psychological pressure for the past five years.\u201d Li herself said she has received treatment, but is still in some pain.<\/p> <p>Li captured international attention in April 2018 by shaving her head and marching over 60 miles from Beijing to Tianjin, the city where her husband was incarcerated, to raise awareness of his plight and demand answers from the authorities.

Eventually, he took a jab at General Muhoozi Kainerugaba \u2014 the son of dictator Yoweri Museveni \u2014 who is attempting to inherit the presidency from his brutal elderly father. \u201cMuhoozi has humongous hips and breasts,\u201d Rukirabashaija tweeted. \u201cHe\u2019s obese. How can a soldier who went to genuine military training and exercises everyday have such a sedentary figure? God punishes the corrupt in a good way with a badge of stupid figure.\u201d<\/p> <p>Before dismissing Rukirabashaija\u2019s tweet as reckless body-shaming, a little context may be useful. Soldiers in the Uganda People\u2019s Defense Forces are allegedly subjected to forced hunger and sleep deprivation during their training. They are famously in shape due to the demands of their work, coupled with their wretched living conditions. In Uganda, an overweight middle-aged man of a prestigious title is said to \u201ceat money.\u201d In other words, he is massively corrupt and uses money or other means of force to coerce those who work for him with impunity.<\/p> <p>According to one of Rukirabashaija\u2019s tweets the day before his abduction, \u201cNo one in their sense of mind can support such a plump moustached pachydermatous inebriated curmudgeon.\u201d (At risk of mispronouncing words he did not know, one police spokesperson refused to read these tweets in his statement to the press on the extrajudicial arrest of Rukirabashaija.)<\/p> <p>Stella Nyanzi with Kakwenza Rukirabashaija (Facebook\/Stella Nyanzi)<\/p> <p>Kainerugaba reacted to this tweet swiftly by wrangling his armed men to forcefully enter Rukirabashaija\u2019s home and whisk him away. The day after the abduction, Stella Nyanzi, a poet so vulgar that her Facebook posts have landed her in prison for years, published \u201cSex in Exchange for Kakwenza,\u201d a graphicly incendiary poem directed at Kainerugaba, putting his atrocities in the spotlight for her hundreds of thousands of followers.<\/p> <p>It is also worth noting that the very act of using social media to discuss matters of public concern \u2014 even when not directly attacking a member of the first family \u2014 is an act of civil disobedience by Ugandans. After placing a daily tax on social media use, Uganda\u2019s government placed an outright ban on Facebook, a platform used by many small business owners to earn a living. VPN downloads in Uganda have skyrocketed since the tax and the Facebook ban.<\/p> <p>Striking back against citizens circumventing the ban, Uganda\u2019s government greedily imposed an additional 12% internet tax, even while children across Uganda were subject to the world\u2019s longest school shutdown. Just as the most modest forms of peaceful dissent in Uganda are met with brute force, everyday use of the internet is also now effectively criminalized.<\/p> <p>State co-optation and a baby\u2019s arrest<\/p> <p>The timeline of these events overlap with another national scandal. On the first day of the new year, NBS Television reported that the Uganda Human Rights Commission, or UHRC, denounced criticism of Uganda\u2019s security agencies. UHRC boss Margaret Wangadya said that security agencies were being wrongly portrayed as leading human rights abusers. Public comments like these continue to reveal the co-optation of human rights institutions by the Museveni family.<\/p> <p>In response to Wangadya\u2019s remarks, the pressure group Friends of Kakwenza showed up to protest at the offices of UHRC, directly opposite the Uganda Police Force national headquarters. Activist Nana Mwafrika \u2014 who lost her uterus to police brutality and now walks with a cane \u2014 came to the offices with Rukirabashaija\u2019s two-year-old son. Moments after her arrival, security operatives fully clad in anti-riot gear invaded the premises and arrested both Mwafrika and the young boy, who had offered his toy trucks in exchange for his father. The duo was forced into a police van and released on bond later that day.<\/p> <p>The malfeasance of regime-captured human rights institutions like the UHRC illustrates an endemic challenge in Uganda. Even would-be allies caution the most modest forms of nonviolent action against Museveni\u2019s brutal regime and insist on taking reformist action through state-controlled \u201cproper channels.\u201d<\/p> <p>Unfortunately international bodies such as U.N. agencies and embassies are perhaps even worse than national human rights offices. Just as the U.N. deliberately suppressed media freedoms during a month-long 323-person occupation of one of their offices in northern Uganda, there is nothing but a loud silence on Rukirabashaija\u2019s torture from most of the foreign missions.<\/p> <p>A legacy of performative colonial courtesy<\/p> <p>Such cynical apathy and regulation of the means of resistance is inherited through colonial history. \u201cThe colonizers used politeness to control and subdue us,\u201d Nyanzi explained. \u201cThis is why radical rudeness emerged. It was in defiance of this passively courteous subjugation.\u201d<\/p> <p>Academic Carol Summers has explored how Ganda resistance to British diplomacy in the 1940s took the form of disorderliness, insults and other forms of rudeness. Nyanzi sees her academic work, poetry and activism as a kind of appropriation of this tradition. If the Museveni administration has accelerated colonial policies of domination, she has also inspired a new generation of writers and activists to take up their pens and gadgets and spew hellfire upon those who are most greedy and bloodthirsty.<\/p> <p>Support Us Waging Nonviolence depends on reader support. Become a sustaining monthly donor today! Donate<\/p> <p>This radical rudeness has emerged despite the fact that Ugandans are highly religious and extraordinarily polite, in one survey being named the world\u2019s friendliest people. But everyone has their limits, and for an increasing number of Ugandans, four decades of the same family in power is one such limit. Rukirabashaija and Nyanzi are not the only Ugandan writers to borrow a leaf from their vulgarly long-winded anti-colonial predecessors. Youth such as Ashaba Annah are honing their own courageous foul-mouthed power with lines like, \u201cI want to be Museveni\u2019s side chic. I want to kiss his ears, gently squeeze his nipples and whisper to him that that boy on Twitter [Kainerugaba] keeps embarrassing the family every time he gets into keyboard exchanges.\u201d<\/p> <p>While crude language may not bring the brave Rukirabashaija back to the land of the living, it has played an extraordinary role in shifting public perceptions of what is and is not acceptable. For the foreseeable future, \u201cFuck kidnappers\u201d will continue to be Uganda\u2019s protest mantra. \u201cWe welcome the world to join us in scathing Muhoozi,\u201d said a member of Friends of Kakwenza. \u201cYour abusive tweets can be directed to the gym-dodging drunkard at @mkainerugaba.\u201d<\/p> <p>Waging Nonviolence is now on Telegram.

They maintain that with unity and the vote, in free and transparent elections, that they will be able to get Ortega out of power.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy family feels powerless, it was a terrible impotence that we felt, but this has not been a reason to silence our voice, to always make resistance here in Leon, and throughout Nicaragua.

Chamorro on the program \u201cEsta Semana,\u201d Reyes denounced that Leon Police Chief, Fidel Dominguez, who personally led the aggression and humiliation against his family, accused him of \u201cwanting to set Leon on fire.\u201d However, Reyes reiterates that he has called the population to calm. He notes that the people of Leon, before a stronghold of the ruling Sandinista Front, are clear of the violations of the regime, being one of the most attacked during the Ortega massacre against the April Rebellion.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is a civic struggle, it is with the vote, it is with the syndrome of the UNO (National Opposition Union, in the 1990 elections) that we are going to win.

The family finally chose to open the door, before the cry of the mother of Maria Eugenia.<\/p> <p>Dominguez gave no explanation for the operation and while his underlings beat the family, the police chief accused them of being drug dealers.<\/p> <p>Reyes recalled that his family has lived several months under the siege of the National Police and Ortega\u2019s paramilitaries, who on many occasions came to throw stones at their house. However, in recent weeks they began to \u201ccreate the expectation and atmosphere of doubt,\u201d as a prelude to the attack that finally took place on November 25.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf they (the Police) had shown a warrant, be assured that we would have opened the door, because we have nothing to hide\u2026we are not, and have never been drug dealers,\u201d Reyes upholds.<\/p> <p>The Police also tried also to make him accountable for stoning houses and patrols of the National Police, showing as evidence a pile of stones in a corner of the house, which\u2014according to Reyes\u2014they use to defend themselves, because it was the same Police that stoned the house late at night.<\/p> <p>Despite the allegations by the police chief, the Reyes Alonso family was not arrested nor do they have a court order against them, the alleged evidence was not taken and they only confiscated cell phones, computers, the wedding rings and cash that the Reyes Alonso had for any emergencies.<\/p> <p>Maria Eugenia Alonso, affirms that the money they had in the house is \u201cthe product of the sale of an inheritance\u201d and mentions a notarized receipt of the sale of a property \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t want that tomorrow (the police) would say that the money is a product of the sale of drugs,\u201d thus, \u201cit is better to demonstrate the origin of the money we had at that time,\u201d she adds.<\/p> <p>The attack: videos and darkness<\/p> <p>Part of the attack on the house of the Reyes Alonso was recorded on Facebook, through a live broadcast. In the video you can see the Police pounding the door of the house with a mallet, while the family demands an explanation and, in a corner of the house, Mrs. Margarita Flores de Alonso, 94, cried inconsolably. After eleven minutes the family opens the door and the image goes completely dark. The worst was yet to come.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe opened the side door, here next to where I am, and that\u2019s when they started beating us, and the first beating they gave us was severe, it was practically looking for how to injure us,\u201d Reyes says.<\/p> <p>Alonso adds that since the officers entered the house \u201cthey came over us, hitting us and placing the handcuffs, throwing us to the ground.\u201d She was taken to the streets and thrown on the ground, where they continued \u201ckicking me and putting their boots on my head.\u201d A group of neighbors approached to help her, but riot officers pushed and threatened them.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf anyone gets close, we will kill you\u201d, the officers said.<\/p> <p>While Alonso was kicked in the street, her husband and son Diego Reyes Alonso were also beaten inside the house, \u201clater they took my son and kicked him outside,\u201d the woman says.<\/p> <p>Simultaneously, the officers \u201cransacked the house everywhere: opening drawers, closets, they took cell phones, took computers; until later we realized that the money was missing,\u201d Alonso commented.<\/p> <p>Reyes, who was inside the house, was taken to the corner where his 94-year-old mother-in-law, \u201cwas crying out loudly,\u201d with orders to calm her.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt that moment, I saw a police officer coming out of my daughter\u2019s room with my wallet,\u201d Reyes recalls. The police stole money from the wallet and also took another hidden amount for emergencies.<\/p> <p>The Police also searched \u201ceagerly\u201d for the daughter of the marriage, Barbara Reyes Alonso, who was not at that time in the house, but they believed that she had already returned from the university.<\/p> <p>The humiliation<\/p> <p>After several hours of darkness and uncertainty about what happened in the home of the Reyes Alonso\u2019s, a series of videos began to circulate on social networks in which Police Chief Dominguez is observed coercing them so that they commit themselves \u201cto stop messing with\u201d the Police and Sandinista Front militants.<\/p> <p>In the videos Diego Reyes, Maria Eugenia Alonso and their son Diego Reyes Alonso appear in handcuffs, who after been physically assaulted were forced to repeat the words of the police chief. I pledge to \u201cnot to mess with militants (of the Sandinista Front) or the people. Non-repetition. With Peace you do not play. I am a man of his word,\u201d repeated Reyes, who was the first to be filmed.<\/p> <p>In another room, the officers beat and forced their son to say the same. The parents remember that from the next room they yelled at him: \u201ccommit yourself, son, commit yourself,\u201d so that they wouldn\u2019t continue hitting him. While they listened to Chief Dominguez threatening him: \u201cNow you will know what it is to be a real man, you son of a bitch.\u201d<\/p> <p>Alonso recalls that her son asked Dominguez to take off his handcuffs off (to show him who was the real man) and instead the officers beat him more.<\/p> <p>\u201cPolice arrogance\u201d<\/p> <p>The couple assures that they agreed to make \u201cthe commitment\u201d required by the police chief, because \u201cwe serve more alive and free.\u201d Alonso believed that the police would force them to do something in writing, but not that they would film them with cell phones, to then spread the videos on social networks.<\/p> <p>But contrary to the intention of humiliating the Reyes Alonso with the publication of the videos, the images constitute irrefutable proof of the abuse of authority, torture and cruel treatment exercised by the National Police against citizens.<\/p> <p>Alonso believes that this irrational action is the product of the \u201carrogance\u201d of Chief Dominguez, an attitude that \u201cdid not let him think\u201d of the consequences of his actions.<\/p> <p>The couple believes that possibly the dissemination of the videos \u201cwas done to send a message of terror to the people,\u201d and tell them: \u201clook at your leaders, see how we have them,\u201d but in reality, \u201cthey did not know that it was a boomerang,\u201d she adds.<\/p> <p>Reyes also believes that the videos were leaked because there is a \u201cgreat discomfort\u201d among the ranks of the \u201cdishonest National Police,\u201d because they are \u201cat the service of a dictatorship when it is the people, with their taxes, who pays their salaries, that feeds them.\u201d<\/p> <p>Long-time opponents<\/p> <p>Diego Reyes and Maria Eugenia Alonso are well-known opponents of the Sandinista Front in the city of Leon. In 2008, Reyes was a candidate for deputy mayor for the Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC) along with Ariel Teran, who at that time denounced the electoral fraud through which the Sandinista Front seized more than 40 mayor\u2019s offices of Nicaragua, including several main cities, like Leon, and the capital Managua.<\/p> <p>Alonso, on the other hand, was a candidate as a substitute deputy on the liberal ballot in 2006, and in 2011 she was the PLC departmental election-monitor, date in which she denounced the electoral fraud of the Sandinista Front and contested the elections in Leon.<\/p> <p>In April, 2018, the Reyes Alonso joined the protests motivated in part by their two children, Diego and Barbara, who went out to demonstrate with their classmates of the UNAN-Leon. Diego was in his last year of Systems Engineering, but was expelled from the university, while Barbara continues to study the fourth year of Dentistry.<\/p> <p>Months ago, the Reyes Alonso denounced the Sandinista paramilitaries damaged the roof of the house by throwing stones and, on several occasions, the same Chief Fidel Dominguez came to threaten them with taking them prisoners if they continued protesting against the Government.<\/p> <p>\u201cFrom this moment I hold the Leon Police Chief Fidel de Jes\u00fas Dominguez, the Sandinista Front and the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega-Murillo, responsible for anything that happens to my own family or any of the [extended] Alonso and Reyes families. I hold all these institutions and all the public figures responsible, such as Camilo Baez, Transito Tellez (former mayor), Ever Delgadillo (of the FSLN Departmental office), and the mayor (Roger Gurdian), because they promote and sponsor the paramilitaries, as do all public figures from here, the FSLN deputies,\u201d Alonso warned.<\/p> <p>After being tortured and publicly humiliated, the Reyes Alonso assure that they will continue denouncing the regime and that it is not within their plans to leave their home or the city of Leon.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"31ODACBENWUKKQCI8G0KA3MGSJIQSW"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":373,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":"November","date":null,"city":"Leon","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Diego Reyes","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maria Eugenia Alonso","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other","torture"],"year":"2019","month":"November","date":null,"city":"Leon","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Diego Reyes","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maria Eugenia Alonso","victim_keywords":"citizen, tortured, activist, Liberal Constitutionalist Party","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":990751477,"Input.title":"Amotekun arrests two suspected bandits with AK-47 rifle, pump action gun, ammunition in Ibarapa","Input.publish_date":"2021-06-17 18:08:53","Input.article_interface":"<p>Amotekun operatives in Oyo State, on Tuesday, arrested two suspected bandits with AK-47 and pump-action rifles, as well as a Dane gun at Alapa Village, Lanlate town in Ibarapa East Local Government Area.<\/p> <p>The suspects, who were of Fulani extraction, were identified as Mumini Saliu, aged 45, and 25-year-old Ibrahim Suleiman.<\/p> <p>Also recovered from them were 82 rounds 7.62mm ammunition and seven cartridges, among other dangerous weapons.<\/p> <p>Tribune Online learnt that they were arrested after intelligence gathering and information on their presence in the village.<\/p> <p>During interrogation, the suspects, who could only speak in their language, disclosed that they were recruited from Katsina State by their leader.<\/p> <p>It was further gathered that the leader, who was coming on a motorcycle to where his members had stayed at Alapa Village, made a u-turn and escaped on sighting Amotekun\u2019s patrol van.<\/p> <p>Confirming the arrest on Thursday, Amotekun\u2019s media unit said that the suspects had been handed over to the Director of State Services (DSS), Oyo State Command, for further investigation.<\/p> <p>YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE<\/p> <p>FACT CHECK: Did UNICEF Say Blocking Children\u2019s Access To Pornography Constitutes Human Rights\u2019 Infringement?<\/p> <p>CLAIM 1: A Twitter user claims UNICEF said any efforts to block children from accessing pornography might infringe their human rights.<\/p> <p>VERDICT: MISLEADING!<\/p> <p>CLAIM 2: A website report shared by the Twitter user claims UNICEF said pornography is not always harmful to children.<\/p> <p>VERDICT: MISLEADING!

At least 277 of them (in 36 countries) were in jail last year.<\/p> <p>This statement was originally published on pen.org on 13 April 2022.<\/p> <p>Index documents brutal crackdowns in Myanmar and Iran; highlights writers worldwide languishing behind bars for decades<\/p> <p>Myanmar \u2013 where an elected civilian government was unseated in a military coup on February 1, 2021 \u2013 joined China and Saudi Arabia as the top jailers of writers and public intellectuals in the world during 2021 in PEN America\u2019s annual census of detained writers, the Freedom to Write Index. The literary and free expression group found that in 2021, at least 277 writers, academics, and public intellectuals in 36 countries \u2013 in all geographic regions of the world \u2013 were unjustly imprisoned or held in detention in connection with their writing or other exercise of free expression. This was a slight increase from 2020, when 273 individuals were counted behind bars, but the past two years, covering the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, both represent a significant increase from 2019, when the Freedom to Write Index documented just 238 cases. Publishing its third edition of the annual census, PEN America found that over half of these 277 writers were also jailed during both 2019 and 2020, and nearly one-fifth \u2013 at least 62 writers and public intellectuals \u2013 were serving sentences of 10 or more years in prison.<\/p> <p>During 2021, Myanmar accounted for the single-largest increase of writers and public intellectuals newly jailed for exercising free expression, due to the military junta\u2019s crackdown on influential voices such as writer Maung Thar Cho. Myanmar jailed at least 26 writers \u2013 a steep increase from 8 in 2020 \u2013 joining China and Saudi Arabia at the top of the list. Together, those three countries account for more than half of the total number of writers held behind bars in 2021.<\/p> <p>Numbers also increased in Iran, which remains in its fourth-place position with 21 writers detained or imprisoned in 2021. The world became painfully aware of the devastating result of the Iranian government\u2019s systemic practice of mistreating jailed writers just months ago, as dissident poet and 2021 PEN\/Barbey Freedom to Write honoree Baktash Abin succumbed to COVID-19 behind bars after being denied timely medical treatment. The incarceration of other members of the Iranian Writers\u2019 Association, such as writer-translator Arash Ganji, who was sentenced in 2020 to 11 years behind bars for translating a book, and the re-arrest of prominent dissident voices such as Narges Mohammadi, led to a total count of at least eight writers being jailed in Iran last year. In Belarus, which saw a dramatic increase in 2020 due to the repression that followed stolen elections in August of that year, the situation for free expression continued to deteriorate, with 10 writers and public intellectuals held behind bars, including political writer Valeria Kostyugova and philosopher Uladzimir Matskevich, both unjustly detained and targeted for their writing about Lukashenka\u2019s rule. Numbers also remained steady in Egypt, Vietnam, India, and Eritrea, all of which have consistently ranked among the top ten worst jailers in the last three years. Turkey experienced a decrease in numbers of jailed writers, placing it as the fifth worst jailer. However, this figure does not capture other threats to free expression including burdensome trials, extradition attempts, and physical attacks facing writers in and exiled from Turkey.<\/p> <p>\u201cPEN America is sounding the alarm that the number of writers and public intellectuals detained or imprisoned in 2021 remains intolerably high, and we are particularly distressed to see Myanmar among the top three jailers of writers, in the wake of the junta\u2019s ruthless crackdown on free expression and human rights,\u201d said Karin Deutsch Karlekar, director of PEN America\u2019s free expression at risk programs. \u201cIn countries across the globe, writers are being jailed for the \u2018crime\u2019 of exercising their right to peaceful expression and, in many cases, for using the power of the written word to counter authoritarianism and hold powerful leaders to account. This persistent global assault on the freedom to write robs writers of their pens and keyboards, and audiences of their words and thoughts, and demands the urgent attention of the international community.\u201d<\/p> <p>Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, said: \u201cWhile the march of authoritarianism is on full and bloody display in Ukraine, a quieter war is being waged around the globe to silence dissent and distort narratives in ways that reify the power of the autocrat. In a digital age when words transcend borders, the insurgent power of the pen can be as threatening to repressive rulers as armed resistance. Writers speak not just for themselves, but also exemplify the power of lone individuals to withstand the forces that would extinguish their free will. At a time when we are witnessing the sore limitations of nations\u2019 ability to turn the tide of rising repression around the world, we must redouble efforts to support the fearless independent voices who dare try to do so.\u201d<\/p> <p>In reviewing three years of data, PEN America also found that a staggering one-fifth of these 277 writers and public intellectuals were serving sentences of 10 or more years in prison for their writing and free expression. Writers such as Egyptian freelance writer and researcher Ismail Alexandrani and Russian historian Yury Dmitriev have been serving lengthy sentences of 10 and 15 years in prison, respectively, in retaliation for their work. At least 11 writers are serving life sentences, including Bahraini human rights blogger Abduljalil Al-Singace and Uyghur economist and blogger Ilham Tohti. Many writers who have been released from state custody still live under a constant threat of surveillance, harassment, and re-capture. At least a dozen writers have been detained multiple times over the past year for their writing, including Ugandan novelist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija and Cuban lyricist Maykel Castillo P\u00e9rez (Maykel Osorbo).<\/p> <p>Among PEN America\u2019s further key findings:<\/p> <p>As of April 2022, over 71 percent of writers counted in the 2021 Index remain in prison or jail; 17 percent are free from state custody but continue to face ongoing legal battles and conviction appeals, probationary restrictions on their ability to work and travel, and\/or continued harassment from state or non-state actors. Only 11 percent have been released without conditions. The remaining 1 percent tragically died in state custody.<\/p> <p>Four writers and public intellectuals counted in the 2021 Index died in custody, including Iranian poet, filmmaker, and 2021 PEN\/Barbey Freedom to Write honoree Baktash Abtin, who died of COVID-19 in January 2022.<\/p> <p>The majority of the writers and intellectuals included in the 2021 count were initially imprisoned or detained prior to 2021, or had faced previous detention or imprisonment. Of the 277 writers detained\/imprisoned during 2021:<\/p> <p>\u25cb 71 percent had also been detained or imprisoned during 2020.<\/p> <p>\u25cb Nearly 53 percent had been detained or imprisoned during 2020 AND 2019; this represents cases of both long-term imprisonments and repeated arrests.<\/p> <p>The regional breakdown is nearly identical to 2020: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region, primarily China and Myanmar, jailed nearly 50 percent of all writers counted in the Index, 137 writers and public intellectuals; while countries in the Middle East and North Africa jailed nearly 30 percent of the 2021 total.<\/p> <p>As was documented in 2019 and 2020, charges related to national security \u2013 e.g., \u201cmembership in a banned group\u201d or \u201csubversion of state power\u201d \u2013 are the prevailing legal justifications for imprisoning writers and public intellectuals; they were applied in 55 percent of cases during 2021.<\/p> <p>While the Taliban\u2019s return to power in Afghanistan has not resulted in significant detentions of writers or public intellectuals in 2021, the situation for free expression has drastically deteriorated under Taliban control, and several writers were killed by the Taliban during the year.<\/p> <p>Spyware and digital surveillance technologies were found to have been used in the capture and imprisonment of writers and public intellectuals, including Emirati writer Ahmed Mansoor, Saudi writer-activist Loujain Al-Hathloul, and Qatar-based Kenyan blogger Malcolm Bidali. The families of imprisoned Indian poet P. Varavara Rao and murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi were also subject to surveillance.<\/p> <p>Even when writers flee their countries to seek safety abroad, the threat of persecution from their governments may follow them. In 2021, the governments of Turkey, China, Pakistan, Belarus, and Iran engaged in harassment of and attacks against exiled writers, ranging from mounting legal charges and extradition attempts, to actual and attempted kidnapping, to physical threats to the writers and their family members.<\/p> <p>PEN America\u2019s Freedom to Write Index, now in its third year, includes case studies of detained writers, an overview of global trends, and regional and country specific breakdowns of threats to free expression. It complements the PEN America Writers at Risk Database, which catalogs writers, journalists, artists, academics, and public intellectuals under threat around the world. The database includes more than 780 cases\u2013both current and historical\u2013that PEN America has worked on from 1987 onwards.<\/p> <p>The Freedom to Write Index is based on PEN America\u2019s own internal case list, PEN America\u2019s Artists at Risk Connection (ARC) case list, and the most recent PEN International Case List. Additionally, PEN America draws from press reports; information provided by PEN Centers around the world; reports from the families, lawyers, and friends of those in prison; and data from other international human rights, press freedom, academic freedom, and free expression organizations.<\/p> <p>PEN America is deeply grateful to the John Templeton Foundation for its generous support of the Freedom to Write Index and Writers at Risk Database. We also extend our thanks to PEN International \u2013 both the Secretariat staff and the Writers in Prison Committee (WiPC) \u2013 for its extensive casework and collaboration on this project.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3LB1BGHFL4BU8SGJOQM4XUL4T86YTJ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1146,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"2021","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Myanmar and Iran","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Baktash Abin","victim_keywords":"writer","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Arash Ganji","victim_keywords":"writer","victim_type":["journalist","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Narges Mohammadi","victim_keywords":"writer","victim_type":["journalist","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Valeria Kostyugova","victim_keywords":"political writer","victim_type":["journalist","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Uladzimir Matskevich,","victim_keywords":"philosopher","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ismail Alexandrani","victim_keywords":"detained","victim_type":["journalist","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":7,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Yury Dmitriev","victim_keywords":"russian historian","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":8,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Abduljalil Al-Singace","victim_keywords":"blogger","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":9,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ilham Tohti","victim_keywords":"blogger","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":10,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kakwenza Rukirabashaija","victim_keywords":"novelist","victim_type":[],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":11,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maykel Castillo P\u00e9rez","victim_keywords":"cuban lyricist","victim_type":[],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":12,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahmed Mansoor","victim_keywords":"Emirati writer","victim_type":[],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":13,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Loujain Al-Hathloul","victim_keywords":"writer, activist","victim_type":[],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":14,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Malcolm Bidali","victim_keywords":"kenyan blogger","victim_type":[],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":15,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Jamal Khashoggi","victim_keywords":"murdered, columnist","victim_type":[],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":16,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"P.

She has been arrested multiple times since 2019 for her transgender identity, but the current conviction is apparently based on her online activities in 2021.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Kuwaiti government\u2019s monitoring, repeated arrests, and imprisonment of Maha al-Mutairi for her trans identity is a blatant violation of her basic rights,\u201d said Rasha Younes, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cKuwaiti authorities should immediately reverse her conviction and allow her to live safely as a woman.\u201d<\/p> <p>Al-Mutairi told Human Rights Watch in a phone interview on October 8 that after receiving news of her conviction she went into hiding. But the police arrested her on October 11 at the hotel where she was staying. She is being held in Kuwait Central Prison, a men\u2019s prison, in a solitary cell designated for transgender detainees.<\/p> <p>Ibtissam al-Enezi, al-Mutairi\u2019s lawyer, told Human Rights Watch that the court used al-Mutairi\u2019s social media videos as evidence to convict her on grounds that she was wearing makeup, speaking about her transgender identity, allegedly making \u201csexual advances,\u201d and criticizing the Kuwaiti government. Her appeals hearing is scheduled for October 31.<\/p> <p>Al-Enezi said the prison officials have not mistreated al-Mutairi and that police had allowed her to call her lawyer. Al-Mutairi told Human Rights Watch that this was the sixth time she has been arrested due to her transgender identity and that before her current arrest she had been barred from traveling outside the country because of the cases against her.<\/p> <p>On June 5, 2020, the authorities summoned al-Mutairi for \u201cimitating women\u201d \u2013 the fourth time she had faced the charge that year \u2013 after she posted a video online saying that the police had raped and beaten her while she was detained in a male prison for seven months in 2019 for \u201cimitating the opposite sex.\u201d The authorities released al-Mutairi on bail on June 8, 2020, without charge. She told Human Rights Watch that the police abused her during those three days in detention, including by spitting on her, verbally abusing her, and sexually assaulting her by taking turns touching her breasts.<\/p> <p>A 2007 Kuwaiti law amended article 198 of the penal code, criminalizing \u201cimitating the opposite sex.\u201d Under article 70 of the telecommunication law, a person who \u201cmisuses\u201d telephone communication may be imprisoned for up to a year and fined up to 2,000 Kuwaiti dinars (USD 7,091).<\/p> <p>In 2012, Human Rights Watch documented the negative effects of article 198 on the lives of transgender women, who reported multiple forms of abuse at the hands of the police while in detention. They described degrading and humiliating treatment such as being forced to strip and parade around police stations, being forced to dance for officers, sexual humiliation, verbal taunts and intimidation, solitary confinement, and emotional and physical abuse that could amount to torture.<\/p> <p>The Kuwaiti National Assembly should repeal the 2007 amendment to article 198, and Kuwaiti authorities should investigate all allegations of police brutality including sexual violence, hold officers accountable for misconduct, and protect transgender people from violence, Human Rights Watch said. Kuwaiti authorities should also amend article 70 of the telecommunication law to remove imprisonment as a punishment for speech violations that amount to defamation as defined by law.<\/p> <p>Article 36 of Kuwait\u2019s constitution guarantees freedom of opinion and expression. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Kuwait has ratified, also guarantees the right to freedom of expression and requires that any restrictions \u201cmust be constructed with care,\u201d ensure that they do not stifle freedom of expression in practice and should not provide for \u201cexcessively punitive measures and penalties.\u201d<\/p> <p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with the ICCPR, has made clear that the covenant prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in upholding any of the rights protected by the treaty. As a state party to the ICCPR and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, Kuwait is required to protect the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, including for transgender people.<\/p> <p>\u201cAl-Mutairi\u2019s story is one of many horrific accounts by transgender Kuwaitis whose only crime is expressing themselves publicly,\u201d Younes said. \u201cKuwait should immediately release al-Mutairi, investigate her allegations of sexual violence in detention, and end its criminalization and harassment of transgender people.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"338431Z1FNU5YZZPEE8BVOMKRDAROO"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":343,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2021","month":"October","date":"11","city":"unknown","region":"unknown","country":"Kuwait","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Maha al-Mutair","victim_keywords":"Kuwait, transgender, LGBT, Human Rights.

El-Baqer and Ibrahim received four-year sentences.<\/p> <p>A trial on the charges held in November was a travesty, with defense lawyers denied access to case files or a chance to present arguments. At least 48 human rights defenders, activists, and opposition politicians in pre-trial detention for months and years were referred to the emergency courts for trial just before Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi lifted the state of emergency in October, Human Rights Watch reported.<\/p> <p>The profoundly unjust conviction and years-long targeting of Fattah and other civil and human rights activists is a testament to the lengths the Egyptian government will go to attack and shut down, through harassment, physical violence, arrest, and imprisonment, those speaking out for free speech and expression and sharing information. In the years since the revolution, journalists, bloggers, activists and peaceful protestors have been arrested and charged under draconian press regulations and anti-cybercrime laws being used to suppress dissent and silence those criticizing the government.<\/p> <p>A free speech advocate and software developer, Fattah, who turned 40 on November 18, has repeatedly been targeted and jailed for working to ensure Egyptians and others in the Middle East and North Africa have a voice, and privacy, online. He has been detained under every Egyptian head of state in his lifetime, and has spent the last two years at a maximum-security prison in Tora, 12 miles south of Cairo, since his arrest in 2019.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s clear that Egypt has used the emergency courts as another tool of oppression to punish Fattah and other activists and government critics. We condemn the government\u2019s actions and call for Fattah\u2019s conviction to be set aside and his immediate release. We stand in solidarity with #SaveAlaa, and Fattah\u2019s family and network of supporters. Fattah has never stopped fighting for free speech, and the idea that through struggle and debate, change is possible.

Let\u2019s communicate with the world again, not to send distress signals nor to cry over ruins or spilled milk, but to draw lessons, summarize experiences, and deepen observations, may it help those struggling in the post-truth era. \u2026every step of debate and struggle in society is a chance. A chance to understand, a chance to network, a chance to dream, a chance to plan. Even if things appear simple and indisputable, and we aligned \u2013 early on \u2013 with one side of a struggle, or abstained early from it altogether, seizing such opportunities to pursue and produce meaning re- mains a necessity.

Before they even began, Smucker and 16 of his fellow missionaries, including three children, stepped into a bizarre trap that thrust them into the national spotlight, as people around the country fasted and prayed for their delivery.<\/p> <p>The abduction<\/p> <p>Returning from visiting an orphanage, the missionaries' van encountered a roadblock. The quick-thinking driver pulled a U-turn, only to be cutoff by gun-toting gangsters. Trapped, the driver was forced to follow the ringleader.<\/p> <p>When he didn't drive fast enough, \"They opened the driver's door and pulled Dale out,\" Smucker said. \"One of them slapped him across his face, grabbed him and took him to the vehicle behind us.<\/p> <p>\"We felt like we were never going to see him again. We didn't know where they were going to take him.\"<\/p> <p>One of the gang members took the driver's seat, speeding down the rocky dirt road. \"I think I spent more time with my hair plastered to the top of the van than I did with my rear on the seat I was supposed to be sitting on,\" Smucker said.<\/p> <p>The driver did rejoin the group, but Smucker said those first few days were disorienting.<\/p> <p>\"They wanted all our money and our phones. They told us they would kill us if we were hiding anything,\" Smucker said, \"but they were drunk or on drugs. So, I don't know if they meant that.\"<\/p> <p>The gang missed 1,500 Haitian gourds \u2014 worth about $15 in U.S. currency \u2014 tucked inside a diaper bag. That money became useful later.<\/p> <p>The kidnappers stuffed 17 hostages, including three children, in a 10 by 12 foot room and gave them a price tag. The captors asked Christian Aid Ministries for $1 million per head for a total of $17 million.<\/p> <p>The aid agency has a policy against paying ransoms.<\/p> <p>Captivity<\/p> <p>So the hostages waited. For two months.<\/p> <p>They had no idea people around the world prayed and fasted for them, Smucker said.<\/p> <p>As the fear eased off, the gangsters \"would cock the guns in front of us expecting to see us cower in fear. But we didn't because the worst they could do was shoot us and we'd go to heaven,\" he said.<\/p> <p>Smucker said he didn't believe their captors would kill them. \"They kept bringing us stuff that didn't make sense to bring us if they were planning to kill us later,\" he said, \"food and mattresses, couches, box fans wired to a generator so we'd have air going inside the room.\"<\/p> <p>The food wasn't great or plentiful: spaghetti in fish sauce for breakfast, rice and beans for dinner. They didn't starve, but Smucker lost 20 pounds in two months.<\/p> <p>The missionaries smuggled food to other captives in the next room. Those prisoners were bound hand and foot, and they weren't Americans. Smucker said he thinks his group may have gotten better treatment because they were Americans.<\/p> <p>The escape<\/p> <p>Throughout the experience, the topic of escape came up. Smucker said, at first, he was one of the most outspoken against escape, until one of his fellow captives convinced him God told him the time had come to leave.<\/p> <p>Smucker told the Madras Pioneer he wanted the group to rely solely on God for their safety. \"We'll open the door and just walk out in full plain site of the guards and just leave. And if God wants us to leave he'll blind their eyes and they won't see us,\" he said.<\/p> <p>The group had smuggled in a stick to shove away the stone and the post holding the door that blocked them in. Then the team lined up single file, and, with the guards just on the other side of the house, the group slipped across the yard and through a hedge that shielded them from view. It took them less than a minute.<\/p> <p>A spiritual journey<\/p> <p>The group left at 2:30 in the morning. Confident their guards would not notice their absence until daylight, the group figured they had three or four hours to establish a safe distance. A full moon lighted their way.<\/p> <p>With two children in tow (ages 10 months and 3 years) they embarked on a peculiar adventure with obstacles worthy of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" \u2014 a canal, which some jumped and most waded, only to find a bridge 500 yards downstream; a lake, which they had to walk around; a deep, dark forest of thorns, through which they bushwhacked for two hours, dodging two-inch spikes and jumping cacti; a cow path, which they took instead of the road to avoid discovery At each crossroads they circled and prayed to get God's direction.<\/p> <p>Sometime after sunrise they decided to be bold and ask for help. In the middle of gang territory they had no way of knowing who might help them, or who might turn them over to their captors.<\/p> <p>The first person they approached pointed to a home where someone had a phone.<\/p> <p>That person was willing, but had no minutes on the phone. The missionaries handed him Haitian money from their diaper bag stash, telling him, \"Buy yourself some minutes and keep the change.\"<\/p> <p>Finally, after two months in confinement, and 10 hours on foot, the group called the mission's Haiti field director. Moments later they were rescued.<\/p> <p>Smucker said saw a father who greeted them at the compound dance and yodel with joy to see his four captive children, whom he hadn't seen in 62 days . \"The reunion was absolutely amazing,\" Smucker said.<\/p> <p>The ransom<\/p> <p>While Smucker says Christian Aid Ministries stayed true to its policy to not pay ransoms to kidnappers, someone did pay a ransom. He says he doesn't know who, and he doesn't know how much. But Smucker understands that his group stayed imprisoned even after the agreed upon sum had been paid.<\/p> <p>The gang's leader is serving a life term in prison, and conversations with Smucker's guards led him to believe the gang used the missionary group as leverage to free their leader. The captives escaped before that happened. On two occasions, the gang released some of the original 17 hostages: first a married couple, he had a severe infection that could lead to death if left untreated; then two women and a child; the women had several infected sores over their skin. Smucker said he's uncertain if the guards released the suffering hostages for money or out of compassion.<\/p> <p>The kidnappers<\/p> <p>\"I don't have any feelings of anger toward the guards,\" Smucker said. \"To them, it's their job. It's how they make their money, by kidnapping people. And these guards had to keep us from escaping.\"<\/p> <p>This was not Smucker's first mission trip and it won't be his last, he said. If anything, the experience energized his enthusiasm.<\/p> <p>\"If Satan was attempting to scare me from ever wanting to go on another mission he was totally unsuccessful.\"<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3ACRLU860PTW615BO3JPQXN25S8EB7"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":338,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"October","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Haiti","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Austin Smucker","victim_keywords":"missionary, construction worker, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"missionaries, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021","month":"October","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Haiti","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Austin Smucker","victim_keywords":"missionary, construction worker, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"missionaries, Christian Aid Ministries, kidnapped, held for ransom, escaped, Haiti","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":908990328,"Input.title":"What Noma did next: how the \u2018New Nordic\u2019 is reshaping the food world","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-28 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Few restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are Noma dissertations and dozens of \u201cNomaheads\u201d \u2013 dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma\u2019s charismatic head chef that one writer declared it \u201cThe Era of the \u2018I Foraged With Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019 Piece\u201d. There is even a 240-page travelogue, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years.<\/p> <p>But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma\u2019s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food \u2013 butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather; 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell \u2013 has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant\u2019s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.<\/p> <p>The New Nordic movement is bound by a set of 10 principles that stress sustainability, locality and respect for the natural world. Those ideals may sound familiar, but the scale of what its adherents are accomplishing makes New Nordic potentially far more transformative than any previous food movement. It is reaching beyond farms and fine-dining restaurants, and into halls of power, supermarket aisles, canteens and classrooms.<\/p> <p>Pretty much anywhere in Denmark, you can walk into a supermarket and find ready meals \u2013 made with traceable organic produce by co-operative kitchens in Copenhagen \u2013 that bear the name of Claus Meyer, Noma\u2019s co-founder. Meyer has also created a food training programme in Denmark\u2019s prisons to reduce recidivism, and he is partnering with Ikea \u2013 which feeds 660 million people a year, making it one of the 10 largest food-service operations in the world \u2013 to \u201cveganise\u201d its menu.<\/p> <p>Further afield, in Bolivia, Meyer has opened restaurants and cooking schools to revive the nation\u2019s hospitality industry. In the US, Dan Giusti, a former head chef at Noma, now feeds more than 4,000 school children a day with nourishing meals, while in Albania, Fejsal Demiraj, one of Noma\u2019s current sous chefs, runs a foundation that researches and catalogues the nation\u2019s village recipes to give the country a documented culinary history for the first time.<\/p> <p>Followers of the New Nordic approach are also working to change food policy and production practices around the world. Building on the success of Noma and the New Nordic manifesto, Nordic governments have set up an institute to promote their region\u2019s food policies to other nations. In addition, Redzepi has set up a non-profit organisation called Mad \u2013 it means \u201cfood\u201d in Danish \u2013 that led a campaign in partnership with the UN in the summer of 2019 against the environmental damage of food production.<\/p> <p>There are also plans for a Mad Academy, with funding from the Danish government, which aims to become \u201ca Bauhaus of food\u201d, as its executive director, Melina Shannon-DiPietro puts it \u2013 a place where all the different steps in food production are taught, and where efforts are geared towards answering the most urgent questions of the day: \u201cHow do we make food sustainable? How do we make food available to all? How do we protect food cultures against globalisation?\u201d<\/p> <p>It\u2019s as if Fergus Henderson took his \u201cnose-to-tail\u201d philosophy into Whitehall, got funding from the National Lottery and ended up getting people across the British isles to butcher their own meat, instead of just feeding offal to well-heeled Londoners. What the New Nordic movement is trying to export is not a single cuisine, but an all-encompassing philosophy of food.<\/p> <p>Chefs were once courtiers; then, in the 19th century, they became artisans. For a time following the deprivations of the second world war, they were relics \u2013 vestiges of lost luxury in a time of hardship and scarcity. As the age of reality television and fast money dawned in the 80s, so too did the bonafide celebrity chef: a hard-living, tortured genius who justified their wealth and fame with a relentless dedication to perfection. Then, around the turn of the millennium, came an era of techno-utopianism and the transformation of the chef into a wizard of molecular gastronomy, with its frozen foams and fluid gels and trompe l\u2019oeil flourishes.<\/p> <p>The New Nordic movement heralded another shift in the world of fine dining. In our current era of climate emergency and brutal inequality, celebrity chefs have transformed again, from ruthless kitchen dictators such as Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White, or mad scientists such as Ferran Adri\u00e0, into crusaders for a better world. Where once the dream was to cook for presidents, now the aim is to work with them. Massimo Bottura, the ebullient owner of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana in Modena, was celebrated in the 2019 Time 100 for his work feeding the homeless. Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the Spanish chef once credited with bringing tapas to the US, now has an accolade far exceeding a Michelin star: a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, for his disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The pursuit of Michelin stars and coffee-table cookbooks has been superseded by pursuing a role in public life.<\/p> <p>Of course, there have been powerful voices challenging the mainstream food industry before. At the height of the first-wave of the environmental movement, in the 70s, Alice Waters\u2019 groundbreaking restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, shone a light on the relationship between food producers and cooks, encouraging diners to reject commercialism and supermarkets, and return to the farmers and ranchers who produce their food in a more sustainable way \u2013 even if it means paying more for that produce.<\/p> <p>Even Jamie Oliver, whose TV persona has been a figure of ridicule to many for the past two decades, invested much of his time in social enterprises, most famously challenging the British government on the quality of school dinners during the heady high-point of the Blair hegemony, and founding the not-for-profit restaurant chain Fifteen, which trained, and was staffed by, apprentices from disadvantaged backgrounds.<\/p> <p>Ren\u00e9 Redzepi at Noma in Copenhagen in 2010. Photograph: Ty Stange\/The Guardian<\/p> <p>But the New Nordic movement has done more than any single chef to make doing \u201cmore than just cooking\u201d the new normal. Redzepi could have opened up a Noma Dubai, and a Noma in the Vegas Bellagio. That\u2019s what the old French masters, such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, did when they reached the peak of the profession: snatch up Michelin stars all over the globe for their luxurious outposts in far-flung, glitzy hotels. Instead, Redzepi is devoting his time to Mad and to a revamped Noma \u2013 often referred to as Noma 2.0 \u2013 just a couple of kilometres from the site of the now-shuttered original.<\/p> <p>Still, the movement \u2013 and the restaurant at its forefront \u2013 has its critics, who argue that it can be sanctimonious, or narrow, or inattentive to the simple notion that food should be a pleasurable experience. George Reynolds, writing for Eater, took Noma to task for its self-imposed Nordic exceptionalism, writing that \u201cits borderline isolationist culinary philosophy doesn\u2019t feel quite right for the present age; more than ever, closing yourself off to other influences is not just unnecessarily limiting but politically unpalatable.\u201d<\/p> <p>The fact is, though, that the rise of New Nordic means there is no longer a bright line between the chef and the activist, the test kitchen and the laboratory. Joe Warwick, the creative director of the World Restaurant Awards, believes that the people leading the New Nordic movement\u2019s restaurants, canteens, labs, thinktanks, policy institutes and cooking schools, have \u201cexerted influence on their industry on a scale that only a few chefs and restaurants in history ever achieve\u201d.<\/p> <p>Two decades ago, Denmark might have seemed a rather unconducive place for a revolution in haute cuisine, let alone in food altogether. Being generous, you could have said that it was a country of open-faced sandwiches, hot dogs and overproof alcohol. But you might also have associated it with the cheapest processed pork in the EU, known for being made in a grim factory from a candy-pink slurry of something that once was a pig. \u201cBack then, all you could get in the centre of Copenhagen was bad French food or bad Italian food,\u201d the food writer Andrea Petrini told me. \u201cThere was no Danish food culture.\u201d<\/p> <p>One of the New Nordic movement\u2019s first feats was to help to transform Scandinavia from a land of herring cured in lye to the gastronomic centre of the world. In 2000, Claus Meyer, then a TV chef and one of Denmark\u2019s most recognisable faces, had been appointed by the Social Democratic government to overhaul the country\u2019s poor culinary reputation. He led a committee to create a special quality label for the best Danish food producers to apply for, in the manner of France\u2019s Label Rouge system, which certifies the quality of foods such as Bresse chicken and Bayonne ham. But at the next election, in 2001, the Social Democrats fell, the initiative was scrapped and Meyer was dismissed. \u201cI realised when the committee was demolished that working towards a better food culture was not wanted in parliament anymore,\u201d Meyer told me. \u201cI found that so crazy.\u201d<\/p> <p>So Meyer bankrolled a proof-of-concept restaurant in Copenhagen that would champion Nordic produce. In 2003, Meyer opened Noma \u2013 the name is a portmanteau of nordisk mad (\u201cNordic food\u201d) \u2013 with Redzepi, then a rising star with no experience as head chef, at the helm. Around the same time, Meyer corralled 13 of the Nordic region\u2019s best chefs into an 18-hour workshop to carve out what a world-leading food culture would look like. Meyer and the chefs agonised over the precise wording, order and emphasis of what would become the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen, published in 2004 \u2013 a 10-point mission statement that sought \u201cto express the purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics we wish to associate to our region\u201d.<\/p> <p>Noma, which had spent its first year tweaking French classics with Nordic herbs, moved with religious fervour towards locavorism, making everything as wild and Scandinavian as possible. We put the forest, or the shore, or the snow on a plate in front of you, Redzepi\u2019s dishes often seemed to say. The hope was that Scandinavia\u2019s restaurants would realise the potential of the region and set about regenerating a \u201cNordic food culture\u201d.<\/p> <p>What took New Nordic from a local concern to a global movement, however, was Noma\u2019s astonishing success. When Noma dethroned the Spanish restaurant El Bulli, a temple of molecular gastronomy, at the top of the 50 Best list in 2010, it represented a transition between two self-defined \u201ceras\u201d of haute cuisine \u2013 from the laboratory to the forest cabin, so to speak. El Bulli would close for good a year later, with its head chef, Ferran Adri\u00e0, recognising the end of his restaurant\u2019s journey.<\/p> <p>El Bulli had always sought to push the limits of what a restaurant could be, bringing in scientific rigour and dedicated lab spaces to make its food more daring. Redzepi had been a student of Adri\u00e0\u2019s at the height of El Bulli\u2019s fame. Noma\u2019s innovation was borrowing Adri\u00e0\u2019s approach and applying it to answer the questions posed by the New Nordic manifesto: how to radically enlarge the scope of what we think of as food, while making it more ethical and accessible.<\/p> <p>Noma began attracting talents from outside the food world: anthropologists, molecular chemists and agricultural scientists who would work in its Nordic Food Lab. This lab space \u2013 which was, for many years, a rigged-up houseboat moored outside of the restaurant \u2013 developed new local products, such as miso made with Danish yellow peas, or salt from shoreline seaweeds for the restaurant to use, while doing original research into the culinary biodiversity of Scandinavia.<\/p> <p>Lars Williams, who was drafted to Noma from Heston Blumenthal\u2019s test kitchen in 2009, moved to the houseboat in 2010 to run the Nordic Food Lab for two years. \u201cWe\u2019d be as scientific as chefs could be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019d try the same idea 30 different times, with 30 different incremental variations, and record it all to assure we\u2019d been rigorous.\u201d Much like the restaurant, the lab operated with solely Nordic produce, but did its best to stretch that definition: \u201cThings from the Faroe Islands were fair game, things from Northern Norway were fair game \u2013 we didn\u2019t just operate around a kilometre\u2019s radius around Copenhagen.\u201d<\/p> <p>A lot of what the lab worked with \u2013 \u00d8land wheat flour, \u00e6ggeblomme (\u201cegg yolk\u201d) potatoes and other native varietals \u2013 had never been tested and examined to such depth before. Through the lab\u2019s research, crops that had all but ceased to be cultivated were finding new uses, and a reason to be grown again.<\/p> <p>At the peak of Noma\u2019s powers, when it felt as if every other food article was about the majesty of New Nordic, Redzepi began to look beyond the restaurant kitchen. In 2011, he launched what would become a series of annual ideas conferences, the Mad Symposiums, where invited speakers \u2013 everyone from the head of the European Environmental Agency to Japan\u2019s most celebrated soba noodle maker \u2013 would address an audience of superchefs, interns, farmers, journalists and industry figures on a patch of Copenhagen dockland.<\/p> <p>These gatherings, which straddled the line between networking events, university lectures and evangelical tent rallies, helped build the movement that is spreading across the globe today. Figures of all stripes and skills would swap business cards, applaud each other\u2019s speeches, plan events and collaborations together, united in the belief that everyone had the destiny of the food world in their hands.<\/p> <p>In 2012, Redzepi launched the Mad non-profit, to \u201cunite a global cooking community with a social conscience\u201d. Aside from its larger symposiums, Mad has run pop-up salons in London, New York and Sydney, inviting local chefs and journalists to talk about topics as expansive as abandoning ego, indigenous food culture and questioning the very value of life itself. They have partnered with Yale to teach students about leadership, have published essay collections on how food cultures overlap all over the world, and launched a foraging app, VILD MAD (\u201cwild food\u201d), to help users find what\u2019s edible in their local park.<\/p> <p>Around the same time that Redzepi founded Mad, Meyer, who sold his majority stake in Noma in 2013, began testing New Nordic principles far beyond Scandinavia. After mapping the countries of the world on metrics such as economic development, crime rates and biodiversity, Meyer decided to open a restaurant called Gustu in Bolivia\u2019s capital, La Paz, with another talented young Danish chef, Kamilla Seidler, at the helm. Seidler and her team used Bolivia\u2019s fauna and flora to create the restaurant\u2019s idiosyncratic cuisine \u2013 llama tartare, alligator escabeche and a lot of quinoa \u2013 and brought the restaurant on to the foodie radar. But more importantly, she completed the restaurant\u2019s primary objective: training the restaurant\u2019s Bolivian staff so she could leave Gustu in their hands.<\/p> <p>To do this, Gustu opened two Manq\u2019a cooking schools, named after the indigenous Aymaran word for food \u2013 one based in the capital, La Paz, and one in Bolivia\u2019s second city, El Alto. Manq\u2019a offered general culinary qualifications that enabled all students to work in the hospitality industry; exceptional students, such as Gustu\u2019s current head chef, Marsia Taha, would be placed on a fast-track scheme to move into the world of fine dining. There are now nine Manq\u2019a schools in Bolivia and two in Colombia, more than 1,000 alumni, three canteens for La Paz locals to eat a freshly cooked three-course meal for just over \u00a31.50, a tour company, a catering service and a fleet of delivery drivers to order a takeaway from.<\/p> <p>Alongside this, there is now a manifesto for a new Bolivian cuisine, drawn up by Meyer, Manq\u2019a alumni and local figures within the Bolivian food scene; there is a Gustu bar selling Bolivia\u2019s national spirit, singani, and a whole host of restaurants across Bolivia, helmed by ex-Gustu staff, continuing to reimagine Bolivian food and make use of farmers and suppliers providing indigenous produce. In 2014, President Evo Morales had the restaurant cater his third-term inauguration. The following year, the restaurant was asked to devise a recipe for special quinoa communion wafers presented to Pope Francis when he visited the country.<\/p> <p>Kamilla Seidler, the young Danish chef who established Gustu in La Paz, Bolivia. Photograph: Aizar Raldes\/AFP via Getty<\/p> <p>Seidler, after Gustu, returned to Copenhagen to carry through her vision of what she calls \u201csocial gastronomy\u201d with her latest restaurant, Lola, which operates as both a fine dining restaurant, and a job inclusion programme that trains socially excluded individuals in cooking and hospitality skills.<\/p> <p>Others, such as Noma\u2019s New Jersey-born former head chef Dan Giusti, have turned their efforts toward improving the food of public institutions. In 2016, Giusti opened Brigaid, a chef-led startup that brings chefs into public schools to train cafeteria staff, ensuring that pupils eat made-from-scratch food every day \u2013 beef tacos and chicken teriyaki instead of vending machine snacks or, worse still, nothing. Brigaid has now expanded into three states, feeding thousands of school children every day across 12 public schools. It\u2019s a world away from the 40 covers a night he served at Noma.<\/p> <p>The volume of social initiatives pushed by Noma affiliates is staggering. Another former head chef, Matt Orlando, runs a scheme that teaches Copenhagen schoolchildren how to grow their own food in small urban spaces. Over the road from him in the docklands of Refshale\u00f8en is Empirical Spirits, a distillery run by Noma alumni that has organised agronomy workshops in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huitepec in Mexico to help the community continue growing its most valuable crop, the Pasilla Mixe chilli.<\/p> <p>Roberto Flore, former head of culinary research and development of the Nordic Food Lab, now runs a lab at the Technical University of Denmark that offers space to experiment and develop schemes addressing matters such as hunger, food waste and accessible technology for food production. One scheme, called ServedOnSalt, has developed a battery that uses solar energy, salt and water to create a cheap and clean-powered cooking stove for use in refugee camps; another has been focused on improving the safety and storability of milk products across rural Ethiopia.<\/p> <p>Scandinavia now leads the world in food policy, too. In 2018, Dr Afton Halloran, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on sustainable food systems, published a collection of innovative food policies from around the Nordic region, the Solutions Menu. It outlined the benefits of 24 innovative food policies, aggregated from successful initiatives around the Nordic region \u2013 including universal free school meals, organic food in hospitals and schemes to help farms move towards zero food waste. Halloran and her co-authors cited Noma and the New Nordic movement as their chief inspiration.<\/p> <p>When the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen was first published, in 2004, the reaction in the world of fine dining was sceptical, if not outright suspicious. The manifesto\u2019s points were criticised for being too vague, too piecemeal, too male \u2013 all the signatories were men \u2013 and too focused on \u201cencouraging cooperation\u201d rather than challenging the region\u2019s industrial food producers through legislation and policy.<\/p> <p>At the time, Camilla Plum, a Danish food writer and TV personality, was quoted in Denmark\u2019s newspaper of record, Berlingske, lambasting the manifesto\u2019s toothlessness. \u201cThe manifesto reminds me a little of Queen Margaret\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s speech,\u201d Plum said. \u201cThere are lots of good-natured thoughts and the usual nice greetings to Greenland. They are beautiful sentiments, but they have no real meaning.\u201d<\/p> <p>Today, though, it seems indisputable that the manifesto more than succeeded in its aims. Scandinavia now stands alongside Spain, France and Italy as one of Europe\u2019s major gastro destinations, with Michelin stars being found as far north as Trondheim in Norway, 200 miles south of the arctic circle. Thousands of jobs in hospitality have been created and, with them, catering colleges full of new students. There are new food producers and artisans, and more diners engaged with the food of the region in which they live.<\/p> <p>That said, the desire to shake up Scandinavia\u2019s culinary reputation seems a little bit provincial now. The movement has long since mutated into a much larger phenomenon. The aim was once for the Nordic kitchen to be seen as natural and sustainable; now, anything with bare wood, organic produce and a compost bin can be thought of as Nordic.<\/p> <p>Beyond that, the movement has established a Nordic way of doing things that can be adapted anywhere in the world, to breathe new life into cuisines that are distinctly Bolivian, or Mexican or Albanian. And these are just the first initiatives that Noma and the New Nordic principles have sparked. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen people who have come from Noma step out into the industry and work towards change,\u201d says Dan Giusti. \u201cBut there\u2019s people in that kitchen right now, and more people who will come through there in future, who we haven\u2019t heard yet. In 20 or 30 years, there\u2019s no telling how big the change could be.\u201d<\/p> <p>Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3X2YVV51PWJPA39A76K66RHTQHFW19"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":955,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":918176542,"Input.title":"PSA detention of 41 J&K residents lodged in UP jails revoked \u2013 Kashmir Reader","Input.publish_date":"2020-04-15 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Srinagar: The J&K government has revoked Public Safety Act detention of 41 persons lodged several jails of Uttar Pradesh.<\/p> <p>On the eve of abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, the government launched a major crackdown arresting above 5,000 people including three former chief minister, politicians, lawyers and trade union leaders.

At a 2017 animal rights march in Los Angeles, he delivered a tearful speech, telling demonstrators that during a long stretch in solitary confinement, a scout ant crawled into his cell and took a nibble of a little ball of bread he had saved to lure the insect. The ant left, he said, but in about an hour and a half thousands of them were in his cell.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt was the first time in so long that I had the contact of anybody or anything,\u201d he told the crowd, his voice catching.<\/p> <p>But Ching, who was born in Hawaii and attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has revealed little about what landed him behind bars.<\/p> <p>In what authorities called a \u201cheinous\u201d and \u201csophisticated\u201d crime, Ching and several accomplices abducted a man who had stolen $60,000 in a drug deal, bound his hands and drove him to a hotel, where they removed his pants and beat him at length, court records show.<\/p> <p>Corrections officials said he served nine years and seven months in prison for kidnapping and causing great bodily injury. Valarie Ianniello, former executive director of the foundation, said Ching told her he spent 11 months in solitary confinement. A California prisons spokeswoman said there was no record he was ever placed in any type of solitary housing.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>Ching did not dispute the lack of such a record, but he said in an email to The Times: \u201cMy experience is my experience. And because your definition of confinement differs from mine, that does not make my experience not true.\u201d<\/p> <p>Two years after his release in 2010, Ching registered his pet food business and the Animal Hope & Wellness Foundation with the state. He describes himself as a fourth-generation herbalist and nutritionist. He also opened the Petstaurant store on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. In 2015, Ching began making regular trips to Asia and posting disturbing images on social media.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Asia once I watched them crucify dogs\u2026. They would get their paws and they would nail gun them into walls.\u201d \u2014 Marc Ching, in a BuzzFeed interview<\/p> <p>Ching speaks at the 2017 Circle V Festival in Los Angeles. (Tommaso Boddi \/ Getty Images)<\/p> <p>He soon became something of a media darling, telling harrowing tales of being assaulted, threatened with a machete, shot at and nearly killed while uncovering animal abuse overseas.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Asia once I watched them crucify dogs,\u201d he said on camera in a 2016 BuzzFeed interview, his eyes red and wet with tears. \u201cThey would get their paws and they would nail gun them into walls.\u201d (Ching did not respond to requests from The Times for any documentation or further details of this incident and the more serious of the alleged assaults against him.)<\/p> <p>He added: \u201cI have videos of hangings, burning them alive, boiling alive, cutting their feet off while they\u2019re still alive, strangulation.\u201d<\/p> <p>Valarie Ianniello, former executive director of Ching\u2019s foundation, said he grew accustomed to the hero treatment. \u201cThe money came in, and it helped build his business up,\u201d she said. (Al Seib \/ Los Angeles Times)<\/p> <p>The segment has been viewed more than 3.9 million times. Viewers praised him online as a hero. Contributions to his foundation surged \u2014 from about $110,000 in 2015 to nearly $2 million the next year, according to the charity\u2019s tax records.<\/p> <p>\u201cI think he recognized that he could be worshiped by this stuff,\u201d Ianniello said. \u201cThe money came in, and it helped build his business up.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ching has opened a second Petstaurant on the Westside.<\/p> <p>::<\/p> <p>There is no dispute that dogs and cats are killed for food in countries across Asia, especially outside the major cities. Local activists in those countries have long fought to end the practice, often working in league with Westerners.<\/p> <p>Foreign and U.S. activists interviewed by The Times said the methods used by butchers to round up and kill the animals \u2014 packing them into cages, drowning them, clubbing them on the head and, in some cases, hanging them \u2014 are uniformly inhumane.<\/p> <p>They said there had been instances when animal abusers burned dogs alive or brutalized them in other ways, and images of the cruelty are posted online. And there have been many times when butchers, after striking a dog\u2019s skull to kill it, burn the animal to de-fur it, even though it is still alive.<\/p> <p>But all of the activists, including seven who do work in Asia, said their efforts had found no evidence to support the notion that the dogs are routinely and deliberately burned or boiled alive, or tortured with beatings and mutilations on a regular basis as Ching has described.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen animals boiled alive, never seen animals beaten or paws cut or anything,\u201d said Lee Fox-Smith, an author who co-founded the Campaign to End the Dog Meat Trade in Cambodia. Since 2017, Fox-Smith said, he has visited more than 200 slaughterhouses and restaurants that serve dog meat.<\/p> <p>He said he initially was afraid to investigate the meat trade because he had heard Ching\u2019s tales of danger. But when he started visiting slaughterhouses, he said, he found that they were the \u201ccomplete opposite\u201d of Ching\u2019s portrayals.<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t chasing you with machetes and guns,\u201d Fox-Smith said.<\/p> <p>He said he first contacted Ching through Facebook in 2018 and offered to help Ching\u2019s foundation shelter dogs rescued in Cambodia. They met twice in that country, Fox-Smith said, and he questioned Ching during the second meeting about Ching\u2019s claim that dogs were boiled alive in Cambodia.<\/p> <p>Fox-Smith said Ching told him, \u201cThey don\u2019t really torture the dogs in Cambodia.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s basically taking the most vulnerable animals in our society and exploiting them \u2026 and it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Fox-Smith said.<\/p> <p>He said Ching was cagey in answering other questions and declined to disclose the locations of slaughterhouses he had visited, making it impossible for Fox-Smith to verify Ching\u2019s claims.<\/p> <p>A still from the video shows butcher Marthen Wondang flashing a thumbs up toward the camera. \u201cThis is exactly what you want, right?\u201d he is heard asking in a local language as a dog is torched. (Image from video obtained by The Times)<\/p> <p>At the market in Tomohon, Indonesia, butchers gave The Times a much different account of the dog torched than Ching offered in his court declaration. They said Ching specifically wanted the dog burned alive, something they and others insisted was not normally done at the market.<\/p> <p>In the raw footage The Times obtained, a man is seen pulling the dog from a cage by its neck. Marthen Wondang, a butcher, moments later takes the dog, hanging from a noose, through the market.<\/p> <p>Someone yells out about a demonstration as Wondang carries the dog to a patch of dirt where chickens are underfoot.<\/p> <p>As the dog tries to escape, Wondang twice throws a rock at its head, subduing it before hanging the animal from a wooden cane. Another butcher starts to blowtorch the dog, which thrashes about in agony. Wondang looks toward the camera and flashes a thumbs up. In a language local to the area, he asks a question whose English translation is, \u201cThis is exactly what you want, right?\u201d<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>A minute and 19 seconds into the burning, the dog, its body charred, lets out its final whimper.<\/p> <p>\u00d7 Butchers in Indonesia told The Times that animal rights activist Marc Ching paid them to hang and burn a dog alive \u2014 a method of killing more cruel than any they say they normally employ \u2014 so he could stage the scene for the camera. Ching denied doing so, and his foundation questioned the butchers\u2019 credibility, saying his work threatened their livelihoods.<\/p> <p>The market has earned a grisly reputation thanks to social media and animal welfare campaigns.<\/p> <p>In one section under brightly colored tarpaulins, vendors hawk local favorites such as smoked skipjack tuna, spiky golden pineapples and tropical jeruk manis oranges that turn green when ripened.<\/p> <p>The center of the bazaar features rats impaled on bamboo sticks, listless reticulated pythons coiled into mounds and charred bats, mouths agape and showing off rows of fangs and thick, pointy tongues. The smell is a noxious mix of cigarette smoke, unrefrigerated meat and kerosene from blowtorches singeing away dead animal hair.<\/p> <p>Dogs are kept in small cages on wheels before they\u2019re slaughtered, their tails tucked between their hind legs and faces withdrawn with droopy eyes.<\/p> <p>Several butchers in Ching\u2019s videos told a Times reporter on a recent visit to the market that they met Ching when he showed up with an interpreter in 2016, saying he wanted to buy dog meat. Wondang said Ching bought four dogs at an inflated price and asked that they be killed in particular ways, including torching one alive, while he recorded video.<\/p> <p>Ching \u201cwas smiling and laughing throughout the process \u2026 like he was happy.\u201d \u2014 Marthen Wondang, butcher<\/p> <p>Wondang and the other butchers said they typically killed dogs by beating them on the head. Burning dogs to death, they said, would be too costly in terms of kerosene and more likely to result in the butchers getting bitten or scratched.<\/p> <p>Strangely, Wondang said, Ching left the dog meat behind after he finished recording.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cHe was smiling and laughing throughout the process,\u201d he said of Ching. \u201cLike he was happy.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ching did not respond to a question about that claim. He said one of the butchers, whom he did not identify, told him in 2016 that they burned 50 dogs to death a day at the market.<\/p> <p>In interviews with The Times, animal welfare activists based in Europe and Asia said some of the butchers had given them the same account of Ching paying to have the dog burned alive on camera. They said the butchers told them this separately at various times between late 2017 and spring 2018, well before The Times began its investigation.<\/p> <p>Lola Webber, Bali-based co-founder and director of the Change for Animals Foundation, a charity registered in England, told The Times she visited the Tomohon market around Christmas 2017. She said \u201cmaybe three\u201d butchers, including one she recognized from Ching\u2019s videos, together approached her group asking whether they were with Ching. Webber said she told them no.<\/p> <p>A dog lies inside a cage at the Tomohon market. (Ronny Adolof Buol \/ For The Times)<\/p> <p>The butchers related that Ching had paid them to torture the dogs on camera in certain ways \u2014 one hanged, another torched alive, Webber said.<\/p> <p>She said she had a similar experience when she visited a meat market in nearby Langowan. About five butchers walked up to her group and asked whether they were associated with Ching, she said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe said, \u2018No, we have nothing to do with Marc Ching,\u2019\u201d Webber added. \u201cThey said, \u2018Do you want to pay us?\u2019\u201d<\/p> <p>Webber said Ching\u2019s actions undermined the work of activists devoted to ending the dog meat trade, which kills dogs in ways that are cruel enough. \u201cIt\u2019s totally shameful,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Frank Manus manages Animal Friends Manado Indonesia, which operates a shelter in Tomohon. He said that during a brief meeting in 2016, Ching showed him photos of a dog being burned alive at the Tomohon market. Manus said he immediately doubted the photos.<\/p> <p>Frank Manus, who manages an Indonesian animal rescue organization, said he immediately doubted the photos Ching showed him of a dog being burned alive in Tomohon: \u201cI go to the market every day, and no such thing happens.\u201d (Ronny Adolof Buol \/ For The Times)<\/p> <p>\u201cI go to the market every day, and no such thing happens,\u201d Manus said.<\/p> <p>Other activists have questioned Ching\u2019s videos. He sued one of them: Deborah Hall, a volunteer who posted on Facebook that Ching \u201cpaid to have dogs torched and legs cut off,\u201d according to the suit. A judge tossed the part of the lawsuit concerning that statement. Hall declined to comment on the suit, which the parties eventually settled.<\/p> <p>Sebastian Margenfeld, a German activist, said he first learned of Ching in 2016 when he stumbled upon a YouTube video on Ching\u2019s rescues in Asia. He said it moved him so much that he reached out to Ching\u2019s charity with the goal of producing a public service announcement, or PSA, in German similar to the foundation\u2019s, using the same footage.<\/p> <p>Soon after, Margenfeld said, he started his own foundation with a name that echoes that of Ching\u2019s charity when translated into English. Margenfeld said the early web postings of his foundation focused on Ching\u2019s work. He added that his foundation later contributed more than $50,000 in funds and services to Ching\u2019s efforts, including the cost of flying American veterinarians to China.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>In the meantime, he said, Ching\u2019s foundation put him in touch with the production company that created its PSA, Sugar Studios LA, which sent Margenfeld a zip file in November 2016 with Ching\u2019s raw footage.<\/p> <p>Margenfeld said he watched it all. He offered to join Ching on rescue missions, but Ching always refused the help.<\/p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he visited Indonesian slaughterhouses in April 2018 to shoot his own footage that he began to question Ching\u2019s footage, Margenfeld said.<\/p> <p>\u201cBecause I had never been to Asian slaughterhouses, I thought it was real,\u201d he said of the torture. \u201cI went to Tomohon and it was so different from Ching\u2019s video.\u201d<\/p> <p>Margenfeld, who is a physical therapist in the town of Freiburg in southwest Germany, said he told the foundation board members of his suspicions about Ching in a May 2018 conference call. The board members stood by Ching, Margenfeld said.<\/p> <p>Times investigations Stories like this don\u2019t happen without your support.<\/p> <p>Subscribe today<\/p> <p>In 2016, Ching traveled to Cambodia with a professional cameraman to film more slaughterhouses. Raw footage from the trip features long monologues during bumpy car rides in which Ching chokes up as he reflects on what he says he witnessed.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe people that really hurt these animals, they\u2019re going to hurt children,\u201d he says during one ride. \u201cThey\u2019re going to molest kids, kidnap people, they\u2019re gonna beat them up.\u201d<\/p> <p>In one scene, Ching is kneeling beside a brick cage of dogs describing the meat trade for the camera.<\/p> <p>\u201cHow many dogs you want?\u201d his interpreter is heard asking him shortly after.<\/p> <p>Ching cuts him off by saying \u201cwhoa\u201d several times and \u201ctime out,\u201d while making a gesture to direct the cameraman to stop shooting. The cameraman points the camera down but keeps it rolling.<\/p> <p>Dressed in a black T-shirt lettered #CompassionProject with the foundation\u2019s web address, Ching says to the cameraman, \u201cYou know going undercover, they show us, just because as a dog meat buyer, usually, this guy is gonna tie one up, he\u2019s gonna hang one over here, and beat him.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cYou know, we\u2019re gonna cut him down so he doesn\u2019t kill the dog and stuff,\u201d he continues on the footage. \u201cSo are you OK documenting that stuff?\u201d<\/p> <p>Someone says, \u201cYeah.\u201d And Ching replies, \u201cI\u2019ll just do one then.\u201d<\/p> <p>After a few moments, the cameraman asks, \u201cDo you feel like this is necessary?\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d Ching replied. \u201cI\u2019d rather not document it\u2026. When I go undercover, I don\u2019t know, I like it better, because, like, it\u2019s just natural, you know. They\u2019re doing it already.\u201d<\/p> <p>A person familiar with the incident said Ching had arranged to have the slaughterhouse hang and beat the dog for the purpose of filming it. The person, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation by Ching, said the hanging and beating ultimately did not occur.<\/p> <p>\u00d7 A person familiar with the incident captured on this video clip said Ching had arranged to have the Cambodian slaughterhouse hang and beat the dog for the purpose of filming it. The person said the hanging and beating ultimately did not occur. Ching denied making any arrangement to harm a dog. An attorney for his foundation described the clip as a discussion about filming a \u201cdramatic reenactment\u201d of a previous hanging at the slaughterhouse, without harming the dog.<\/p> <p>Ching and two Los Angeles attorneys for his foundation offered a series of descriptions of the clip.<\/p> <p>Jeremy Gray, one of the lawyers, said in an email to The Times that the video from Cambodia \u201cappears to be a misleadingly doctored clip that is removed from its appropriate context.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Times engaged an audio-visual forensics expert in Michigan, Ed Primeau, to analyze the Cambodia footage. Primeau said he found no evidence that it had been altered.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese video recordings are authentic and represent the events as they occurred,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Ching later said in an email to The Times, \u201cIt is likely that the clip recorded a discussion about organizing the filming and that may have included some payment to enter the slaughterhouse.\u201d He said that there was no plan to mistreat a dog and that no animal was hurt.<\/p> <p>Selmont, the other attorney for the foundation, described the clip as a discussion about filming a \u201cdramatic reenactment\u201d of a previous hanging at the slaughterhouse without harming the dog.<\/p> <p>\u201cMr. Ching and the foundation ultimately decided against including anything like that in the documentary and the videographer himself has confirmed that no such event ever occurred,\u201d Selmont said in an email.<\/p> <p>Selmont said the earlier hanging occurred several months before the discussion on the clip: \u201cMr. Ching posted an iPhone video of him cutting down a dog that he saw in real time being hung at a dog butcher. Mr. Ching, at that exact moment, paid for the dog and filmed himself in real time cutting down that dog who otherwise [would] have been slaughtered for meat.\u201d<\/p> <p>The foundation\u2019s PSA includes a shot of Ching cutting a hanging dog free.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>In another clip from Cambodia, a young man in board shorts drops a live dog into a vat of scalding water. As the dog thrashes about, the man quickly jumps back to avoid getting splashed. Moments later, the vat falls over as the dog tries to escape.<\/p> <p>Activists told The Times that dogs are not normally boiled alive in Cambodia, if only because the butchers could be scalded in the attempt. They said those vats were often used instead to de-fur dead dogs in boiling water. In the background of the Cambodia clip, a second young worker is seen removing the fur from what appears to be a dead dog in a similar tub of steaming water.<\/p> <p>On numerous occasions, Ching claimed that his life was in danger in Asia. When first asked for details by The Times, Ching responded with written descriptions of two car crashes, getting into altercations in Cambodia and China, being punched in the face in Korea, various encounters with butchers who threatened but did not injure him, and being pushed off a \u201csmall cliff\u201d in Taiji, Japan.<\/p> <p>The Times then presented Ching with information from media interviews and social media posts in which he is quoted as saying that, in addition to several assaults, he was shot at, had a machine gun stuck in his mouth and almost died four times. Ching responded that he had tried to suppress his memories of those incidents \u2014 which he has said occurred in recent years \u2014 because of their traumatic nature.<\/p> <p>\u201cThose things happened to me,\u201d Ching said in an email. \u201cOver the years both intentionally and I believe subconsciously I have tried to forget the worst of these experiences as it is best for my mental health.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ianniello, the foundation\u2019s former executive director, said Ching told her of an incident in which he was pushed to the ground at a slaughterhouse, where he swallowed feces and blood. Ching said that as a result he contracted flesh-eating bacteria that required surgery to eliminate, according to Ianniello and another former foundation employee, Kiana Kang.<\/p> <p>Ching did not respond to a Times query about the incident. He would not provide The Times with any documentation or other means of verifying the more serious episodes, such as medical records or the names of any witnesses. His foundation said in an email that Ching never reported the assaults to Asian authorities or to American diplomatic officials because doing so \u201cwould have affected the mission of the trips.\u201d<\/p> <p>Pringle and Tchekmedyian reported from Los Angeles, and Pierson reported from Indonesia.

It first appeared in the British Guardian newspaper.<\/p> <p>\u2018Climate of fear\u2019: Nigeria intensifies crackdown on journalists.<\/p> <p>Fisayo Soyombo was eating an evening snack in Lagos in late October when a colleague called to warn him about a plan hatched by Nigerian government officials at a clandestine meeting to arrest him.<\/p> <p>Hours earlier, the second in a three-part undercover series by the Abuja-based investigative journalist on corruption in Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system had been published.<\/p> <p>\u201cI made two more calls that night [to government sources] and it was clear I was in trouble,\u201d Soyombo said. According to all three contacts, the government wanted to prosecute him under a law criminalising certain types of communication with inmates.<\/p> <p>Soyombo pulled out of a public event he had travelled to Lagos for, and went into hiding.<\/p> <p>Had he been detained, Soyombo would have been the latest victim of a crackdown on the media and freedom of speech this year in Nigeria, which is 12th out of 13 on the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Impunity Index, a ranking of countries with the worst records of unsolved murders of journalists.<\/p> <p>Soyombo said he received a lot of support on social media in the days after he went into hiding, and that the plan to arrest him has seemingly been dropped. The Nigerian correctional service eventually released a statement saying work could be done to clean up the system, and that it had \u201cno intention of arresting or harassing\u201d Soyombo.<\/p> <p>At least three journalists are currently detained in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Omoyele Sowore, an activist and founder of the New York-based online news agency Sahara Reporters, was taken by secret police from a hotel room in Lagos in August. Sowore, who stood as a candidate in February\u2019s presidential elections and usually lives in the US, has been charged with treason, cyberstalking and money laundering for allegedly sharing false and insulting information about the president, Muhammadu Buhari.<\/p> <p>Despite being granted bail earlier this month his lawyers said they were denied access to him, and he remains in detention and is currently on hunger strike.<\/p> <p>Jones Abiri, the publisher and editor-in-chief of the Weekly Source newspaper, was arrested in May and charged with cybercrime, sabotage and terrorism. The case related to 2016 allegations of links to rebels in the Niger Delta, after which he was detained by Nigeria\u2019s intelligence agency for two years without trial.<\/p> <p>In the southern state of Cross River, Agba Jalingo, who publishes the Cross River Watch paper, was arrested in August, days after the publication of an article about alleged corruption. Jalingo has been charged with treason and a bail request has been declined.<\/p> <p>Return to the dark days<\/p> <p>Human rights activists and civil society groups say that the muzzling of the press under Buhari has raised the spectre of a return to the dark days of military rule in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Buhari, a former army general who has been president since 2015, was also Nigeria\u2019s head of state in the mid-1980s, when he took power in a military coup. At the time he introduced the draconian Public Officers (Protection Against False Accusation) law, better known as Decree 4. The law targeted the press, criminalising the publication of information deemed injurious to the junta.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese (recent) incidents suggest a disturbing trend towards repression of freedom of expression and create a climate of fear which may stifle the media,\u201d said Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThrowing reporters in jail for doing their job of informing the public sends a chilling message to journalists, activists and citizens.\u201d<\/p> <p>Soyombo said gagging the press was a misuse of power. \u201cIt is an irony that a president and state governors who ascended to power via the polls can suddenly not tolerate dissent,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, in an article titled \u201cShort walk to totalitarianism?\u201d, Matthew Hassan Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, criticises the controversial Social Media and Hate Speech Bills. Excerpts:<\/p> <p>Democracy thrives on debate, consensus building, negotiation, persuasion, argumentation, rule of law, process, and inclusion. The military thrives in a coup culture, secrecy, betrayal, violence, command structure, exclusion and lack of transparency. That explains why I have always warned against describing the current charade of violent elections as democracy\u2026<\/p> <p>\u2026The recent outrage by the Minister of Information, Mr. Lai Mohammed, over public reaction to the Social Media Bill, is illustrative of the point I am making, namely, that not all who call themselves democrats appreciate the enormous burden that goes with the claim today\u2026The Minister says that no amount of threat, blackmail, etc., will dissuade the government from going ahead with the social media because it is borne out of patriotism. Really?..<\/p> <p>\u2026Is this the language of people who understand or have really imbibed and internalized the spirit and fine principles of democracy? If we must do your will or face the wrath of government, then, this suggests two things: First, we must obey you and government because we are subservient to you and government. We must be answerable to you not the other way round. We must, because if we don\u2019t, we can be penalized by imprisonment for daring to question its wisdom or seek to have an input in a law that concerns us\u2026<\/p> <p>\u2026To be sure, there is no one, including myself, who is not aware of the dangers posed by the social media. We have all been victims. However, should the government wish to address this matter legally and openly, why should they be afraid of a public debate?<\/p> <p>Public debate<\/p> <p>\u2026Technology is here to stay. All we can do is to try to make it work for us\u2026the future of employment lies there and we need to extend the frontiers of the imagination of our [brilliant and energetic] youths to enable them explore a future that can make us safer and prosperous\u2026<\/p> <p>\u2026It is a measure of who we are and the premium we place on life that anyone would dream of suggesting a death sentence for the propagation of Hate speech.

Bradbury has emerged as a shill for the security agencies, and is fingering the Trotskyist movement for state repression. His hysterical outburst, under the headline \u201cChina lab leak theory refuses to die,\u201d is further confirmation that there is nothing remotely left wing or progressive about the Daily Blog, a middle-class nationalist publication that supports the Labour Party-Greens government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.<\/p> <p>The attack on the SEG, which was reposted on April 27 with an extended denunciation of China, has the character of a preemptive strike. It is aimed at intimidating anyone who opposes the pro-war hysteria being whipped up by Washington and its allies, including the New Zealand political establishment and media. The Daily Blog\u2019s post undoubtedly reflects discussions that are underway within the political establishment about how to stop the development of a genuine internationalist revolutionary leadership in the working class to oppose the drive to war and the capitalist system that is its source.<\/p> <p>Bradbury\u2019s reference to China\u2019s human rights abuses echoes the cynical propaganda from the media and US intelligence agencies, which have accused China, without any evidence, of carrying out \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Uyghur population. The US ruling class has zero concern for the working class in China, including the Uyghurs, who certainly suffer repression and exploitation at the hands of the capitalist state.<\/p> <p>The political opposition of the Trotskyist movement to the Maoist Chinese Communist Party regime in Beijing and its oppressive methods from the standpoint of the international working class is longstanding and well-documented. However, the US is actively preparing for war with China and deliberately escalating tensions with Beijing.<\/p> <p>Over the past three decades, it is US imperialism and its allies, not China, which are responsible for the criminal wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya\u2014to name only a few of the most recent\u2014that have killed millions of people and destroyed entire societies. The invocation of \u201chuman rights\u201d has been used to justify every single war against America\u2019s enemies\u2014including the present US-NATO proxy war against Russia in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Bradbury\u2019s attack on the SEG comes as the war in Ukraine escalates, and there are growing threats against China, which US imperialism regards as the major obstacle to its domination over the Eurasian landmass. The Ardern government has sent dozens of troops to Europe to join the war effort and faces a growing crisis in New Zealand. As elsewhere around the globe, historic class struggles are on the agenda, fuelled by the soaring cost of living and the disastrous spread of COVID-19.<\/p> <p>There are precedents for the sort of state repression the Daily Blog is demanding. During the First and Second World Wars, the New Zealand state imprisoned hundreds of anti-war and left-wing activists for \u201csedition\u201d; leftist and socialist publications were banned. In the United States, 18 members of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party were put on trial and sentenced to prison terms during WWII for opposing the war.<\/p> <p>Bradbury\u2019s comparison of the SEG to Vidkun Quisling, Norway\u2019s Nazi-collaborationist leader in World War II, is not accidental: during World War II, the Trotskyists were smeared as fascist collaborators, by Stalinists and others, because of their principled opposition to war. By absurdly painting China as the modern-day equivalent to Nazi Germany, the Daily Blog presents any opposition to the US-led war drive as criminal.<\/p> <p>Bradbury makes clear that what he regards as \u201ctreason\u201d is the SEG\u2019s exposure of the anti-Chinese propaganda that he has been publishing for years to justify New Zealand\u2019s integration into the US military build-up in the Indo-Pacific region. The blog post particularly objected to a World Socialist Web Site article by SEG member John Braddock, which outlined the Daily Blog\u2019s role in promoting the right-wing conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in a laboratory in Wuhan.<\/p> <p>The theory, which has been thoroughly discredited by scientists, was concocted by Trump\u2019s fascist ally Steve Bannon and his associates. The lab leak lie serves definite political purposes: to divert blame for the disastrous US response to the pandemic, which has led to more than a million deaths; and to demonise China in preparation for war. The Daily Blog editor unabashedly lines up behind Trump, declaring that he \u201cmight have been right all along\u201d and that \u201cdeep suspicion of China is justified.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Daily Blog paints China as a threat to New Zealand and calls for it to be turned into a \u201cfortress,\u201d with military spending increased from 1.5 to 5 percent of GDP. Bradbury has joined the latest media furor over China\u2019s security agreement with the Solomon Islands. On March 26, he declared: \u201cChina is stepping into our sphere of influence through insidious means masquerading as security.\u201d He called for NZ \u201cto decouple its economy from China,\u201d describing this as a \u201cnational security issue.\u201d<\/p> <p>Since 2017, the Daily Blog has promoted the pro-US academic Anne-Marie Brady, a key player in New Zealand and Australia\u2019s anti-China campaign. She has accused Chinese-born MPs of being spies, and demanded state surveillance of Chinese student organisations, cultural groups, media organisations, academics and businesses with ties to China.<\/p> <p>Now, Bradbury wants this witch hunt to be extended to target the Trotskyist movement, the only political tendency fighting to build a global movement of the working class against war, based on socialist and internationalist principles.<\/p> <p>Internationally, as the danger of a third world war increases, the ICFI faces increasing censorship and threats of state surveillance. In Germany, the Socialist Equality Party has been labelled as \u201cleft wing extremist\u201d by the state security agency, because of its opposition to capitalism and to the revival of militarism. In Australia, where the Morrison government and Labor are promising billions of dollars for the military to prepare for war with China, electoral laws have been changed in order to prevent the SEP and other minor parties from participating in the current election under their party name.<\/p> <p>Internationally, the US-led war plans are backed by various pseudo-left groups, which are close to the trade union bureaucracy and represent sections of the upper middle class. These include the Democratic Socialists of America, Socialist Alliance in Australia, and the Left Party in Germany, among others.<\/p> <p>In New Zealand, the Daily Blog speaks for a similar middle-class layer, close to the Labour Party and its allies, including the unions, which fears any working class movement developing against the Ardern government\u2019s militarist policies, as well as its assault on living standards and the criminal decision to end NZ\u2019s COVID-19 elimination strategy.<\/p> <p>In the final analysis, the privileges of the upper middle classes depend on the suppression of the class struggle at home, and on New Zealand\u2019s alliance with the US and Australia, which safeguards NZ\u2019s neo-colonial \u201csphere of influence\u201d in the Pacific and its business interests throughout the world.<\/p> <p>The blog\u2019s contributors include former Unite union leader Mike Treen, liberal commentator Chris Trotter, former Alliance Party member Liz Gordon, former Mana Party member John Minto, and other individuals from the pseudo-left liberal milieu. None of them has objected to Bradbury\u2019s embrace of the SIS and his denunciation of socialists as traitors; this is because they agree with him.<\/p> <p>We call on workers to reject the nationalist and militarist propaganda spewed out by the Daily Blog, and to defend the SEG and the WSWS against Bradbury\u2019s provocative call for suppression by the state.<\/p> <p>Workers and young people seeking to oppose war can only do so by turning to the socialist and internationalist program fought for by the SEG, which is aimed at uniting workers throughout the world in opposition to the capitalist system. In New Zealand, this requires a political break from the Labour Party and its supporters, including the Daily Blog.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"39KV3A5D1AMAE873CHREAC5LNSCS7K"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":356,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2022","month":"April","date":"16.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"New Zealand","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"SEG, Socialist Equality Group, China, New Zealand, U.S.","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2022","month":"April","date":"16.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"New Zealand","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"SEG, Socialist Equality Group, China, New Zealand, U.S.","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":914891653,"Input.title":"A Timeline Of Samuel Little's Serial Killer Confessions","Input.publish_date":"2020-03-25 11:26:56-04:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>During his expansive interviews with investigators, Samuel Little said he lost count of his victims after 84.<\/p> <p>For more than 30 years, serial killer Samuel Little went undetected as he terrorized women across the country, claiming upwards of 93 victims.<\/p> <p>Although he was not convicted of murder until 2014, Little was no stranger to law enforcement.

He told investigators his mother was a sex worker, though a 1940 census lists her occupation as \u201cmaid,\u201d according to the monthly periodical Cleveland Magazine. His father was a 19-year-old named Paul McDowell, and Little used the alias \u201cSamuel McDowell\u201d throughout his life. Little later moved to Lorain, Ohio, where he was raised by his paternal grandmother.<\/p> <p>February 1954<\/p> <p>Little is committed to the Boys\u2019 Industrial School, a reformatory for teenagers near Columbus, Ohio, according to Cleveland Magazine. He would later say he was sent there for stealing a bicycle. By the time he left, a year and a half later, he had been reported 47 times for disciplinary infractions.<\/p> <p>November 1956<\/p> <p>Little is arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, and sent to a youth authority for burglary, reported Cleveland Magazine.<\/p> <p>1961<\/p> <p>Little is convicted of burglary for a break-in at a Lorain furniture store and sentenced to three years in prison, according to Cleveland\u2019s Plain Dealer newspaper.<\/p> <p>1966<\/p> <p>Little is arrested in Cleveland, Ohio, for assault and battery after beating a woman, reported Cleveland Magazine.<\/p> <p>January 31, 1970<\/p> <p>Little picks up his first victim, Mary Brosley, 33, at a bar in North Miami Beach, Florida. He then drove her to a secluded area near the Everglades and strangled her to death before burying her in a shallow grave, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.<\/p> <p>May 1971<\/p> <p>Little is charged with armed robbery in Cleveland, according to The Plain Dealer. While awaiting trial, he is charged with sodomy. He was later found not guilty on robbery charges and never tried on the latter count.<\/p> <p>1972<\/p> <p>After his acquittal, Little takes up with a woman named Orelia \u201cJean\u201d Dorsey, who was 30 years his senior. She would remain his girlfriend, traveling companion and partner in crime until her death from a brain hemorrhage in 1988, according to Cleveland Magazine.<\/p> <p>Throughout the 1970s, Little and Dorsey moved around the Midwest and South, supporting themselves by shoplifting, burglary and fencing stolen goods. Little would confess to committing multiple murders across both regions during the decade, according to the FBI. Most of the victims, however, remain unknown.<\/p> <p>Though he was often arrested for an assortment of petty crimes, he spent little time in jail, according to The Plain Dealer.<\/p> <p>September 1976<\/p> <p>Little is arrested for intent to ravish-rape outside St. Louis, Missouri. His victim tells police Little choked her from behind with an electrical cord, forced her into his car, beat her unconscious, then drove to a remote location and raped her, according to the Associated Press. He is sentenced to three months in county jail.<\/p> <p>November 1982<\/p> <p>Little is arrested for shoplifting in Pascagoula, Mississippi. After authorities discover he matches the description of a suspect in the death of Melinda Rose LaPree, he is charged with her murder, reported the Associated Press. A grand jury, however, declines to indict him. He is subsequently extradited to face charges for the rape and murder of Patricia Ann Mount in Gainsville, Florida.<\/p> <p>January 1984<\/p> <p>Little is tried for the murder of Patricia Ann Mount, with whom he was seen leaving a bar in 1982. Her bruised, naked body was later found in a field. After deliberating for less than a half-hour, jurors acquitted him on all charges, according to local newspaper The Gainesville Sun.<\/p> <p>Little told investigators he killed at least 10 women in the South and Midwest in the early 1980s before relocating to California. Some of the murders have been linked to existing Jane Doe and missing person cases, while other victims have been identified as a result of Little\u2019s confessions, such as Mary Jo Peyton, according to Cleveland ABC affiliate WEWS-TV, and Frances Campbell, according to the Savannah Morning News, both of whom were killed in 1984.<\/p> <p>October 1984<\/p> <p>Little is arrested for two assaults in San Diego and later tried for attempted murder. After the jury deadlocks, he pleads guilty to assault and false imprisonment and serves two and a half years in prison, reported the Associated Press.<\/p> <p>1987<\/p> <p>Following his release from prison, Little moves to Los Angeles. In July of that year, he murders Carol Alford, afterwards dumping her body in a South Central alleyway, according to the Associated Press. Alford was one of seven women Little claims he murdered in the city that year, though their identities remain unknown.<\/p> <p>1989<\/p> <p>Little murders Audrey Nelson that August and Guadalupe Apodaca a month later, according to the Associated Press.<\/p> <p>1990s<\/p> <p>Little told the FBI he murdered numerous women throughout the decade in Los Angeles, the South and Ohio.<\/p> <p>1991<\/p> <p>Little steals a carton of cigarettes back in Lorain and hits someone while trying to flee the scene of the crime. He is arrested and charged with aggravated robbery, according to The Plain Dealer.<\/p> <p>1998<\/p> <p>Little pleads guilty to attempted robbery for his arrest in \u201891 and is sentenced to two years in prison, reported The Plain Dealer.<\/p> <p>2005<\/p> <p>Little claims his final victim was a woman named Nancy whom he strangled in Tupelo, Mississippi, according to the Los Angeles Times. Investigators believe her identity could be Nancy Carol Stevens, whose body was found off a road that August.<\/p> <p>2007<\/p> <p>Little is arrested in Los Angeles for possession of cocaine and pleads guilty, reported the Associated Press. After failing to attend a court ordered drug rehabilitation program, a bench warrant is issued for his arrest.<\/p> <p>September 5, 2012<\/p> <p>Little is arrested at a homeless shelter in Louisville, Kentucky, and extradited to California to face the narcotics charge, according to the FBI.<\/p> <p>January 2013<\/p> <p>Los Angeles Police Department detectives find a DNA match between Little and the Alford, Nelson and Apodaca murders. The Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office charges Samuel Little with three counts of murder and special circumstances for multiple murder, reported the Los Angeles Times.<\/p> <p>September 2014<\/p> <p>Following a brief trial, a jury finds Little guilty on three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Alford, Nelson and Apodaca. He is later sentenced to three consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, reported the Los Angeles Times. At sentencing, Little screamed, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it!\u201d<\/p> <p>2018<\/p> <p>After gaining Little\u2019s trust, Texas Ranger James Holland begin interviewing him in 2018 with the help of FBI analysts Christie Palazzolo and Angela Williamson. Up until that point, the 78-year-old had maintained his innocence, but he soon began detailing his crimes.<\/p> <p>Little shared what names he could remember and even sketched what his victims looked like. Over the next year and a half, Little gave investigators 650 hours\u2019 worth of interviews, eventually putting the number of his victims at 93, though he said he stopped counting at 84, according to the Los Angeles Times.<\/p> <p>That December, Little pleaded guilty to the 1994 murder of Denise Christie Brothers in Odessa, Texas. As part of his plea deal, he avoided the death penalty and received another life sentence, according to NBC News.<\/p> <p>August 2019<\/p> <p>Little pleads guilty to the murders of four women in Ohio \u2014 Anna Stewart, whose body was found in 1981 in a suburb of Columbus, the 1984 murder of Mary Jo Peyton, the 1991 murder of Rose Evans in Cleveland and an unknown woman he says he murdered more than 30 years ago, whose body has yet to be discovered. He was sentenced to four consecutive life terms, according to The Plain Dealer.<\/p> <p>October 2019<\/p> <p>The FBI confirms Samuel Little is \u201cthe most prolific serial killer in U.S. history,\u201d and says he has been \u201cmatched to 50 cases\u201d of the 93 murders he claims he has committed. The FBI also releases a timeline of Little\u2019s life and crimes in hopes of identifying more of his victims.<\/p> <p>As Little\u2019s confessions are matched to existing cases and as new victims are identified, more murder indictments are being filed across the country.<\/p> <p>Now in failing health, Little continues to work with Texas Ranger James Holland to help identify his victims and detail his crimes.<\/p> <p>Watch \u201cCatching A Serial Killer: Sam Little\u201d now on

(Carlos Garcia Rawlins\/File\/Reuters)<\/p> <p>Chinese Attorney Had License Revoked for Defending Falun Gong Practitioner<\/p> <p>Chinese human rights lawyer Ren Quanniu revealed more details about local authorities\u2019 decision to revoke his license.<\/p> <p>Via a Twitter post on Jan. 5, he explained that the justice department of Henan Province served him a notice, in which it claimed that he violated a courtroom regulation during the trial of Falun Gong practitioner Zhang Minglang two years prior.<\/p> <p>Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a practice centered around meditation exercises and moral teachings based on truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance. Amid Falun Gong\u2019s growing popularity in mainland China, the Chinese regime, fearing the practice would threaten its rule, launched a sweeping suppression campaign in July 1999.<\/p> <p>Millions of Falun Gong adherents have since been detained inside prisons, labor camps, and other facilities in China, with hundreds of thousands tortured while incarcerated, according to the Falun Dafa Information Center.<\/p> <p>Ren represented Zhang after the latter was arrested in December 2017 for his faith.<\/p> <p>The license revocation notice alleged that Ren violated Article 39, Item 3 of the\u201cAdministrative Measures for the Practice of Law,\u201d which states that an attorney may not \u201creject the characterization of a heretical organization by the state,\u201d and that Ren\u2019s behavior was \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cseverely damaged\u201d the law profession.<\/p> <p>The Chinese regime has labeled Falun Gong and many other minority faiths as \u201cheretical organizations\u201d in its propaganda to vilify adherents.<\/p> <p>On Twitter, Ren thoroughly refuted these claims, stating that there is no law classifying Falun Gong as a heretical group, so it was not possible for him to reject the characterization.<\/p> <p>Ren added that he was never informed of the justice department\u2019s investigation into him.<\/p> <p>Past Cases<\/p> <p>According to Minghui.org, a U.S.-based website that tracks the persecution of Falun Gong in China, Zhang was 82 years old when he stood trial on Nov. 7, 2018.<\/p> <p>Zhang was charged for \u201cundermining the law using a heretical organization.\u201d<\/p> <p>Zhang entered a not guilty plea. During the trial, Ren argued that his client had caused no harm to society and that there was no legal basis for the charge.<\/p> <p>\u201cFalun Gong believers, whether practicing in groups on the street corner or in public squares, or practicing alone in their homes, do not endanger others or interfere with anyone\u2019s life, work, or studies. If they do not hinder or disturb others and, like the square dancers that gather at morning and dusk, have the same right to assemble and practice exercises outside, then why do Falun Gong practitioners not have the freedom to practice their faith?,\u201d Ren said in court.<\/p> <p>After 12 hours, the judge adjourned the trial without a verdict. Months later, on Jan. 7, 2019, Zhang was sentenced to five years in prison.<\/p> <p>Ren\u2019s license was revoked soon after he defended a client in the case of 12 Hongkongers who were arrested by Chinese coast guards as they attempted to flee to Taiwan for political asylum.<\/p> <p>He represented Wong Wai-yin, who was among eight people sentenced to seven months by a court in Shenzhen city for \u201cillegally crossing the border.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ren also represented citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was arrested for her coverage of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan city last year.

Protests: Statement from Alliance of MENA Socialists","Input.publish_date":"2019-10-21 22:25:07","Input.article_interface":"<p>Massive new popular mobilizations have erupted and shaken Iraq since October 4th. The protests denounce economic and social difficulties, and are directing their rage against theft, corruption, and repression by the ruling sectarian, bourgeois political parties, and thuggish militias.<\/p> <p>The Alliance of Middle Eastern and North African Socialists expresses its support for the popular mobilizations in Iraq for democracy and social justice and against the sectarian and bourgeois ruling class.<\/p> <p>These protests have especially focused their rage towards corruption, unemployment and decay of public services in a resource-rich country suffering from chronic electricity and water shortage. Offices of different sectarian political parties were ransacked and set on fire by protesters.<\/p> <p>According to Iraqi government statistics, the extreme poverty rate was estimated at around 22.5 percent which is widely regarded as an underestimation. Other estimates indicate that around 13 million or 30% of a total Iraqi population of 38 million inhabitants live in abject poverty. The country has one of the lowest labor force participation rates in the world and in the region. That rate represents 48.7% of the population, 12% of women and 26% of youth. Iraq is a rentier economy, which continues to rely heavily on petroleum exports that provide some 90% of its government revenue, and 58% of the country\u2019s GDP. Other productive sectors such as the non-petrochemical manufacturing industry and agriculture, have largely been neglected<\/p> <p>The current protest movement is mainly located in the capital city of Baghdad and the southern region of the country, which is mostly Shi\u2019a. Iraqi Kurdistan and the Sunni-majority areas of the country \u2013 which have suffered from extensive destruction because of the multiple military conflicts since 2003 and the war against the Islamic state in Mosul \u2014 have not yet joined this current wave of protests. However, in the past few years, protests in Kurdistan with similar demands against The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Northern Iraq have occurred on different occasions.<\/p> <p>Large sectors of the protest movement have also denounced Iran\u2019s role in Iraq by chanting \u201cIran, Iran, Out, Out\u201d\u201d and burning Iranian flags. Since the U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, Tehran\u2019s political and economic influence has grown with collaboration by its Iraqi allies in power. In fear of these protests, Tehran has deployed surveillance systems along its borders and bolstered its security apparatuses.<\/p> <p>At the same time, pro-Iranian influence actors in Iraq have tediously smeared the protest movement as a \u201cconspiracy\u201d, laying blame for the violence on alleged \u201cinfiltrators\u201d backed by unnamed \u201cforeign enemies\u201d. The pro-Iranian state militias of the \u201cPopular Mobilization Units\u201d, known as Hashd al-Sha\u2019bi and its political branch, Fateh Alliance, have vehemently opposed the current protest movement and called for repressive and bloody means to end it.<\/p> <p>The Iraqi government has responded in a repressive and violent manner against the protesters by killing more than 150 people and wounding at least 6,000 since the start of the protests on October 4. Hundreds have been arrested, an unknown number of them tortured. Protesters have been killed and wounded by snipers among the security forces, who fire indiscriminately into crowds from rooftops while the interior ministry denies that government forces have shot directly at protesters. The government has also clamped down on media coverage almost immediately as the protests began. The offices of local and international media were attacked last week, and journalists have said they were warned by the authorities not to cover the protests. With the internet down, there was little coverage of the protests on television, and people have relied on other means to get footage and information out.<\/p> <p>At the same time, the Iraqi government also initially announced a series of social measures in response to demands from protesters. These include housing assistance and the promise to build 100,000 housing units, benefits for retirees and unemployed youth. The promise of new housing development came after the government\u2019s decisions In September to destroy buildings and housing in informal settlements in several parts of the country where three million Iraqis have built unauthorized structures on state property.<\/p> <p>On October 9, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi went further by announcing a cabinet reshuffle, declared three days of national mourning and said those who shot protesters would be punished. These measures and proposed reforms, some of which have been recycled from a package of proposed reforms after protests in 2015, are however unlikely to ease public anger and the grievances of the protest movement.<\/p> <p>In 2011 and more so since 2015, Iraq has experienced recurrent protests by the popular classes. This new wave of popular protests in Iraq demonstrates the determination of large sectors of Iraqi society, especially youth, including many women, to bring about radical change.<\/p> <p>The demands for social justice and economic redistribution against the neoliberal destructive policies cannot be dissociated from the opposition to the sectarian political system. The overwhelming majority of protesters continue to denounce the Islamization and sectarianization of social and political life. They call for a \u201ccivilian\u201d state based on an inclusive citizenship recognizing the ethnic and religious diversity of the Iraqi population.<\/p> <p>The sectarian political system, promoted under Saddam Hussein\u2019s despotic rule, has been restructured and strengthened following the devastating 2003 invasion of Iraq. This restructured sectarian system was further consolidated by the Iran-backed Iraqi sectarian and bourgeois ruling classes.<\/p> <p>It is impossible to envisage solutions to the problems of democracy and socio-economic injustice for the Iraqi working class within the sectarian political system that maintains and protects the domination and privileges of the ruling class. The various factions of the Iraqi bourgeoisie have exploited the oil rent to build and strengthen a monolithic network of patronage, nepotism and corruption, while the majority of Iraq\u2019s population have continued to suffer from poverty and indignity.<\/p> <p>The Iraqi working class has also been hampered by the labor laws of Saddam Hussein, which were among the laws of the Saddam regime to remain during the American occupation. Furthermore, modifications affecting corporate law have removed trade union input into corporate decision-making. In 1987, the Iraqi regime had reclassified most Iraqi workers, including those in large state enterprises, as civil servants, thus prohibiting them from forming unions and bargaining. Despite some changes to much of Iraq\u2019s legislative structure, this decree remains in effect and only very small improvements have occurred. Public servants are still not allowed to strike.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, Iraqi women have opposed the violence inflicted on them by traditional and misogynist dominant beliefs, the government, the religious fundamentalist sectarian militias, the U.S. and other invading forces. Since the 2003 invasion, the U.S. \u2013 installed sectarian regime ruling the country has worked to undermine the progressive Personal Status Law [family law] set forth by leading feminists and communists in 1959, a law which even survived the brutal Saddam Hussein regime.<\/p> <p>Women such as Tara Fares, Rasha al-Hassan, Hamoudi Al Mutairi were some of the latest to be killed in a wave of misogynistic and homophobic attacks aimed at silencing diverse voices aiming to liberate their future from the dichotomy of extremisms. Such voices of resistance include artist Marina Jaber, whose \u201cI am society\u201d campaign set to reclaim women\u2019s role in the public space. Another is the Organization of Women\u2019s Freedom in Iraq, which after rejecting the U.S. invasion has continued to mobilize in its aftermath, organizing protests against domestic violence in Baghdad, calling for the International Criminal Court to prosecute the Islamic State for its crimes against women and LGBTIQ individuals, and establishing shelters for women escaping domestic violence.<\/p> <p>Reflecting these dynamics, and more, the celebrated slogan of the MENA revolutionary processes, \u201cThe People Want the Fall of the Regime\u201d has re-emerged in many demonstrations by many voices.<\/p> <p>The Alliance of Middle Eastern and North African Socialists express our solidarity with the protesters in Iraq. We denounce the violent repression by the Iraqi security forces and militias. We support the opposition to all forms of sectarianism, racism and sexism.<\/p> <p>Solidarity with the oppressed!<\/p> <p>Alliance of Middle Eastern and North African Socialists<\/p> <p>October 17, 2019<\/p> <p>Originally posted at the Alliance of Middle Eastern and North African Socialists website.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"302OLP89D1MCQTG5MYDY5Y3T2VTACS"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":851,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","torture"],"year":"2019.0","month":"10","date":"4.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"potesters, activists, women, youth","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tara Fares","victim_keywords":"activist, killed","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Rasha al-Hassan","victim_keywords":"activist, killed","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hamoudi Al Mutairi","victim_keywords":"activist, killed","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","torture"],"year":"2019.0","month":"10","date":"4.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"potesters, activists, women, youth","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Tara Fares","victim_keywords":"activist, killed","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Rasha al-Hassan","victim_keywords":"activist, killed","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hamoudi Al Mutairi","victim_keywords":"activist, killed","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1022562367,"Input.title":"Column: Democracy is dying in Hong Kong.

But independent news organizations still challenged the erosion of democratic freedoms. Opposition politicians spoke out in defense of autonomy and independence.<\/p> <p>Everywhere there were signs of debate, dissent and resistance: detritus from the previous night\u2019s protests, peeling wall posters and angry anti-government graffiti.<\/p> <p>But those days are over.<\/p> <p>Opinion Columnist Nicholas Goldberg Nicholas Goldberg served 11 years as editor of the editorial page and is a former editor of the Op-Ed page and Sunday Opinion section. Read more from Nicholas Goldberg<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>The protests have been beaten back. More than 100 pro-democracy leaders and activists have been charged under the draconian national security law imposed in June 2020. Thousands of demonstrators have been arrested as well; the charges include subversion and separatism.<\/p> <p>Government is being purged of critics. In 2021, Hong Kong and Chinese authorities demanded that elected officials and candidates for office pledge their loyalty not just to Hong Kong and its laws, but to Beijing as well. Hundreds of members of Hong Kong\u2019s district councils resigned or were removed from office. Even those who swore fealty were removed if the authorities didn\u2019t find their pledges credible.<\/p> <p>The repression of the independent media has been intense \u2014 and successful. In the final week of December, Stand News, an independent pro-democracy website, was raided by hundreds of police officers; seven editors, board members and a journalist were arrested and the organization said the site would be taken down. A few days later, on Jan. 3, Citizen News, a small online news site, said it too would stop publishing due to fears for the safety of its staff.<\/p> <p>They were among the last remaining independent voices in the city. Their closure followed the shutdown in June of the feisty, independent tabloid Apple Daily, owned by clothing tycoon Jimmy Lai, who is now in prison.<\/p> <p>The teachers union and the city\u2019s largest independent trade union were disbanded in 2021, as was the Civil Human Rights Front, which had organized some of the biggest pro-democracy demonstrations.<\/p> <p>Police and courts have become \u201ctools of Chinese state control rather than independent and impartial enforcers of the rule of law,\u201d said Human Rights Watch in June. Since my visit, academic freedom has been threatened, museums harassed, films canceled, monuments removed, political slogans banned and books removed from libraries.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is now merely a functionary of the government in Beijing.<\/p> <p>This is how democracies disappear. Without leaders who dare to speak out, without venues to publish or broadcast independent news, without recourse to an independent judicial system, without basic rights and liberties guaranteed and protected by the government, there\u2019s no way for the people of Hong Kong to stand firm against the encroaching overlords from the mainland.<\/p> <p>Their subjugation is terribly depressing to watch.<\/p> <p>The city was under British colonial rule for more than 150 years, until 1997, when the United Kingdom handed it over to China. At that time, the Chinese government agreed to allow a significant measure of political autonomy and personal freedom for 50 years under a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d<\/p> <p>But that promise has been broken.<\/p> <p>The United States government decries the situation, of course. After Stand News was shut down two weeks ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \u201cJournalism is not sedition\u2026. A confident government that is unafraid of the truth embraces a free press.\u201d<\/p> <p>But what is the U.S. prepared to do about it? There\u2019s a limit to how much pressure the American government will put on a mighty superpower like China to protect the people of Hong Kong. Hong Kong matters more to China than it does to us.<\/p> <p>If nothing else, what\u2019s occurring in Hong Kong is a reminder that democracy is fragile. That\u2019s something we should take to heart.<\/p> <p>There was a period just after the Cold War ended when some people believed the forward march of democracy had become irreversible, that the collapse of dictatorships was inevitable , that the liberal democratic order had triumphed over totalitarianism and despotism. In the early 2000s, the number of free and democratic countries grew dramatically, by all sorts of measures.<\/p> <p>But in recent years, democracy has been in retreat. The Economist\u2019s \u201cDemocracy Index\u201d for 2020, for instance, found that thanks to \u201cdemocratic backsliding,\u201d only 8.4% of the world\u2019s people were now living in what could be considered full democracy. The index\u2019s \u201cglobal democracy score\u201d was lower than its been since it was created in 2006.<\/p> <p>Backsliding has occurred here at home, too. The Economist now classifies the U.S. as a flawed democracy.

For many years, the state propaganda on counterinsurgency has been nonstop. Rampant issuances of search warrants against progressive groups and individuals were traced to a small number of judges, infamous of which is Quezon City Executive Judge Cecilyn Burgos-Villavert, who produced most of these warrants, some of which were found by other courts to be defective.<\/p> <p>Under Duterte, red-tagging is used as a weapon to silence dissent and as justification for human rights abuses.<\/p> <p>These abuses were intensified by the Anti-Terror Law and Executive Order No. 70, which institutionalizes a whole-of-nation approach to end the decades-long insurgency in the country.<\/p> <p>The latter led to the creation of the notorious National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), which rampantly red-tags and terror-tags critics of the administration.<\/p> <p>In its 2012 report, non-profit International Peace Observers Network (IPON) said that red-tagging (then called \u2018red-baiting\u2019) is the practice of (mostly) state actors publicly and detractively labeling government-critical individuals and organizations as state enemies, communist terrorists, or members of communist front organizations with the goal of destabilizing democratically legitimized state authority. Furthermore, state actors create an environment of fear in order to instill belief in an internal or external threat to national security so as to gain societal support for the implementation of a legal framework that defines a \u201cstate of exception.\u201d<\/p> <p>These laws were weaponized under Duterte\u2019s administration to terrorize the Filipino people.<\/p> <p>\u201cSince its creation in 2018, the NTF-ELCAC has systematically engendered human rights violations and even war crimes in counterinsurgency operations,\u201d Karapatan Secretary General Cristina Palabay said.<\/p> <p>Far from its \u2018mandate\u2019 to end the decades-long armed conflict and bring about \u2018inclusive and sustainable peace, the Duterte government has used the NTF-ELCAC to wage a war targeting human rights defenders, journalists, critics, and anyone who stands in the way of Duterte\u2019s de facto martial law,\u201d she explained.<\/p> <p>In the five years of Duterte\u2019s presidency, Karapatan has documented 424 extrajudicial killings, 504 frustrated extrajudicial killings, 1,159 illegal arrests and detention, and 2,807 illegal arrests without detention.<\/p> <p>Read: 3 years of Duterte\u2019s counterinsurgency: 250 civilians dead, thousands displaced<\/p> <p>In commemoration of International Human Rights Day, Bulatlat compiled its reports of cases of red-tagging that led to killings, enforced disappearances, illegal arrests and detentions, and other forms of human rights abuses under the Duterte administration.<\/p> <p>A death sentence label<\/p> <p>IPON expounds that in practice, red-tagging generally starts with rather innocuous methods.<\/p> <p>A victim\u2019s cell phone, email account, or mail may begin to receive threatening text messages. Every week, an unidentified motorbike driver goes by the victim\u2019s residence at the same time and on the same day. Victims are clearly kept under observation at home and at work, either by technological means such as eavesdropping on phone lines or by informants who are always on the lookout for them.<\/p> <p>The most serious effect of red-tagging is that victims may be subjected to torture, enforced disappearances (ED), or extrajudicial killings (EJK). Although it may not always result in these human rights violations, it is present in many EJK and ED cases. Labeling critical individuals and organizations as communist terrorists or subversives is a typical justification for coordinated operations against them. As a result, it frequently goes hand in hand with the criminals\u2019 impunity.<\/p> <p>\u201cAccusation as a communist \u2013 \u201cred-tagging\u201d \u2013 is a potential death sentence, which doesn\u2019t stop some from using it,\u201d Michael Beltran wrote in an article for The Interpreter.<\/p> <p>The establishment of the NTF-ELCAC on Dec. 4, 2018 was a pivotal move in intensifying the culture of impunity and red-tagging in the country under Duterte\u2019s regime. Its whole-of-nation approach has killed thousands of innocent lives.<\/p> <p>Among those who were red-tagged and killed are long-time peasant organizer and peace consultant Randy Echanis, Karapatan human rights paralegal Zara Alvarez, nine Indigenous Peoples (IPs) leaders, nine Southern Tagalog activists, and Dr. Mary Rose Sancelan with her husband Edwin.<\/p> <p>Randall \u201cKa Randy\u201d Echanis, 72, was found dead at his residence in Quezon City early morning of Aug. 10 last year.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe was made to suffer before he was killed,\u201d said forensic pathology specialist Raquel Fortun, who examined Echanis\u2019s remains, confirming that he was tortured.<\/p> <p>Read: \u2018Randall Echanis was made to suffer before he was killed\u2019 \u2013 forensic expert<\/p> <p>Zara Alvarez, a paralegal of Karapatan, is the 13th human rights worker from the group who was assassinated in Duterte\u2019s term.

Sancelan is the leader of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases in the said province.

violence and state-sponsored attacks on Filipino educators. Its comments follow an independent investigation which shows that the Duterte government is deliberately violating human rights, using violence and repression against those who are standing up for education, democracy, and peace.<\/p> <p>INVESTIGATE PH \u2013 an independent investigation on human rights violations in the Philippines \u2013 launched its third report on 13 September.<\/p> <p>The report delves into violations of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other collective rights including rights to livelihood, religion, education, self-determination, development, and peace. These breaches have arisen against the backdrop of civil and political rights violations that face a broad array of social sectors: workers and peasants, overseas Filipino workers, women and LGBTQ people, urban poor people, children, the education sector, the religious sector, as well as Indigenous and Moro peoples.<\/p> <p>This third report factually documents systematic attacks against trade unions and human rights activists in the Philippines. It highlights the stories of victims, especially of those who work in the education and religious sectors, independent media, as well as human rights activists who denounce state violence.<\/p> <p>Human rights violations in the Philippines have intensified<\/p> <p>It concludes that human rights violations in the Philippines have intensified since the release of a report in June 2020 by the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR). The OHCHR report on the Philippine rights situation was released to help facilitate international accountability mechanisms. It was led by by an international group of commissioners composed of parliamentarians, lawyers, religious leaders, and activists.<\/p> <p>The INVESTIGATE PH report also showed a 50-76 per cent increase in drug war killings per month during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. It also cited President Duterte\u2019s \u201cwhole-of-nation\u201d approach to counterinsurgency led by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict. This state-sponsored approach uses local and national institutions to wage attacks against human rights defenders, people\u2019s organisations, and civil society. This is done through mass arrests and detention on trumped-up charges, \u201cred-tagging\u201d, and state-perpetrated killings.<\/p> <p>The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which has become the main instrument in the counterinsurgency programme, has worsened the abuses. It is used to vilify activists and their organisations and to criminalise dissent, the report found.<\/p> <p>Global context<\/p> <p>The report sought to substantiate the OHCHR\u2019s June 2020 findings. Its launch coincided with the opening of the 48th Regular Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet updated the Session on the progress and results of the \u201ctechnical cooperation and capacity building\u201d programme with the Philippine government for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Philippines. This \u201ctechnical cooperation and capacity-building\u201d programme was adopted by the 45th Regular Session of the UNHRC in October 2020 in response to the June 2020 OHCHR report on the Philippines rights situation.<\/p> <p>While civil society has welcomed the programme, the report urges the UNHRC to conduct an independent probe on the rights violation under Duterte. Such a review would facilitate international accountability mechanisms amid impunity and failure of domestic mechanisms.<\/p> <p>Education International: Educators and union activists are denied justice<\/p> <p>Education International\u2019s General Secretary David Edwards \u2013 member of the INVESTIGATE PH Commission \u2013 said he has \u201cseen the constant reports and first-hand accounts of our members of the vicious attacks aimed at silencing educators and union activists\u201d. He emphasised that Education International\u2019s members \u201chave always been committed to quality education, democracy, and peace [and] have been targeted personally and collectively\u201d.<\/p> <p>Education unions in the Philippines have also reported extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and unjustified detentions. \u201cThis violence against teachers and unionists is met with impunity. They are denied justice at every step,\u201d he stressed.<\/p> <p>In the education sector, the COVID-19 measures have been exploited to cover up the crackdown on legitimate protests, he said, denouncing the government\u2019s failure to provide quality education for teaching and learning.<\/p> <p>Children are targets<\/p> <p>The impact on children and youth of these and other governmental measures is devastating. \u201cChildren are being killed under the excuse of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019. The government also wants to lower the age of criminal responsibility which would result in children being arrested and detained,\u201d he asserted.<\/p> <p>Children have become victims of militarised lockdowns. Education International was informed that, in July 2020, Fabel Pineda, a 15-year-old girl, who violated a quarantine curfew, was abused by the policemen who held her in custody. After filing rape charges, Fabel was gunned down. Other children were locked in coffins and dog cages for allegedly violating quarantine protocols.<\/p> <p>\"Education International\u2019s members have always been committed to quality education, democracy, and peace and have been targeted personally and collectively\u201d. David Edwards, Education International's General Secretary and INVESTIGATE PH Commissioner<\/p> <p>Call for global solidarity in face of state violations of rights<\/p> <p>State violations of human rights are felt across society, Edwards added, as they violate freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, undermine activism and participation in unions and human rights, religious and political organisations.<\/p> <p>Schools, educators, and their organisations are targeted. The Duterte government consistently attacks the professional autonomy of teachers, instrumentalises school curricula, and suppresses indigenous education.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe call for an end to the violence and state-sponsored attacks on the brave Filipinos working for the respect of the basic rights of children and adults, quality public education, and a democratic society. We stand together with them and we call on the global community to respond in solidarity and support until the repression comes to an end and the perpetrators are brought to justice,\u201d Edwards stated.<\/p> <p>Background to reports on human rights breaches<\/p> <p>INVESTIGATE PH began its investigation of human rights violations under the Duterte administration in December 2020. It released two previous reports, in March and July 2021 respectively.<\/p> <p>The three Reports produced this year examine over 50 emblematic cases of human rights violations under Duterte. These include the massacres of nine Tumandok Indigenous Peoples on 30 December 2020 and nine activists on a \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d on 7 March 2021. The reports draw on the testimonies of survivors and witnesses, relatives of victims, human rights advocates with direct knowledge of state violence, and expert witnesses or resource persons.<\/p> <p>The First Report highlights grave violations of the right to life and other provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). It also showed the systemic lack of effective domestic remedies.<\/p> <p>The Second Report highlights three \u201cwars\u201d against:<\/p> <p>Poor people in the guise of a war on drugs<\/p> <p>Dissent<\/p> <p>The Moro People in the guise of a war on terror and degraded the integrity of the justice system<\/p> <p>The OHCHR will report on the progress of the technical cooperation with the Philippine government at the 48th UNHRC session on 7 October.<\/p> <p>In addition to its submission to the Human Rights Council, the third report will be submitted to the International Criminal Court in September 2021 to support its full investigation into suspected crimes against humanity committed by the Philippine President, Rodrigo Duterte, and his government.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3UUSLRKAUNI4CJOLFRWPFDJLMNZD74"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"2303b84d-0115-4284-b9df-e5c53f359001","work_time_in_seconds":1242,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"06","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Philippines","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"educators, union activists, vicious attacks, extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, unjustified detentions","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fabel Pineda","victim_keywords":"15 year old girl, abused by policemen, gunned down","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"children, locked in coffins, locked in dog cages","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"nine Tumandok Indigenous Peoples, massacred","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"nine activists, massacred","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"06","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Philippines","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"educators, union activists, vicious attacks, extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, unjustified detentions","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Fabel Pineda","victim_keywords":"15 year old girl, abused by policemen, gunned down","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"children, locked in coffins, locked in dog cages","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"child"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"nine Tumandok Indigenous Peoples, massacred","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"nine activists, massacred","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":991885774,"Input.title":"About 100 abducted from Nigerian school in broad daylight;

Belgian officials investigated and rejected the allegations as \u201cpropaganda\u201d and \u201clies,\u201d but European officials have not been outspoken on this score.<\/p> <p>\u2013Israel acted against the groups because they have been giving information to the International Criminal Court\u2013 whose prosecutor began a criminal investigation of Israel this year under a complaint filed by Palestine five years ago.<\/p> <p>\u2013Israel also acted because it fears the progressive effort in Congress, led by Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, to cut off aid that Israel uses for arresting children.<\/p> <p>\u2013Some of the targeted human rights groups employ U.S. citizens. So the groups demand that the Biden administration and the Congress consult these Americans before accepting the Israeli claims.<\/p> <p>The extraordinary webinar on Friday was sponsored by a list of influential American organizations: the Middle East Institute, Foundation for Middle East Peace, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), Century International, and the International Crisis Group.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have 100s of people from all over the world today which is a testimony to the interest in hearing from you, the Palestinian organizations,\u201d Lara Friedman of Foundation for Middle East Peace said at the outset.<\/p> <p>Six Palestinian human rights groups targeted by Israeli government offer a webinar on what they do, sponsored by leading Washington thinktanks, Oct. 29, 2021.

McCollum.<\/p> <p>We became a resource for the ICC. This is one of the main reasons. The second is for [our] lobbying inside the Congress\u2026 in order to draft laws to deprive Israel of funds for torturing and illegitimate treatment of children\u2026 We started to lobby and to have more and more congressman who are supporting our work, and to discuss inside the Congress, Israeli violations. It is considered as crossing red lines.<\/p> <p>Congresswoman Betty McCollum<\/p> <p>The Israeli backlash has been two-pronged, Quzmar said\u2013 first, from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Strategic Affairs. Then from Israeli rightwing NGOs that seek to smear Palestinian human rights groups as terrorist to an international audience.<\/p> <p>We faced since 2014, a campaign of attacks against all DCI partners around our world, even the banks we were working with, every month sometimes if not weekly\u2026<\/p> <p>These attacks culminated with a raid on DCIP\u2019s offices in Ramallah last July, confiscating computers and files.<\/p> <p>Quzmar said there is no legal basis for the claim that DCIP is linked to terrorist organizations. \u201cWe believe there is a political reason behind this decision. We know that because our work in the U.S. and in the ICC\u2013 they are trying to silent us or forbidding us from continuing our mission.\u201d<\/p> <p>Sahar Francis of the prisoners\u2019 rights group Addameer said the groups are being targeted \u201cbecause we are succeeding.\u201d<\/p> <p>We are succeeding in changing the paradigm in the analysis of the international law level, in highlighting that this regime is more an apartheid and colonialist regime, and not just occupation. This is because of the success of the NGOs in the accountability level, especially.. our work versus the International Criminal Court in bringing cases.<\/p> <p>Shawan Jabarin of the human rights group Al-Haq also said his organization had \u201ccrossed the red line\u201d when it assisted the ICC investigation of Israeli war crimes. Israel tried to dry up Al-Haq\u2019s funding, and failed, and also targeted the group with \u201cMafia methods,\u201d including death threats.<\/p> <p>[When we] go after the commanders and key figures, those who are complicit in war crimes \u2014 this is the red line for them. Because all the time they claim that they are the only democracy in this region, but the facts show a completely different story\u2026 They try to shut us down, they try to send fear when they put roses of funerals behind the doors of our colleagues, those who work in the Hague\u2026 This is Mafia methods they use\u2026 They failed in their process. They have been contacting our funders and our partners for so long and they have failed to dry up our resources. This [terrorist designation] is the last bullet in their hand and this is a political bullet because it has no legal basis and no security basis\u2026 They will not silence us.<\/p> <p>Ubai Al-Aboudi of the Bisan Center for Research and Development said that Israel first sought to close the organizations through its military law system. But it was never able to bring \u201creal charges\u201d so it turned to the rightwing NGOs to push spurious claims against the organizations in international fora. Those groups include UK Lawyers for Israel, UN Watch, NGO Monitor, and Regavim.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe right wing organizations\u2026 make absolutely ridiculous claims\u2026by the motto, \u2018If you repeat the lie enough, people will start believing.\u2019 People didn\u2019t start to believe them. But they start to believe it themselves.<\/p> <p>Israel presented its dossiers of secret evidence to EU ambassadors a couple of months ago, Al-Aboudi said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe began to hear statements from them, there is no evidence and substance to the claims.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is state terrorism at its finest hour,\u201d Al-Aboudi said, and described the European rejection of the evidence.<\/p> <p>They presented their so-called evidence dossier back in May through the Belgiums. We have a joint program supported through a Belgian NGO by [the Belgian government]\u2026 The Belgians did their own investigation. The Belgian minister in charge of international cooperation went in front of parliament said this is propaganda\u2026 There is no proof in the file.\u201d<\/p> <p>Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz lately told the Jerusalem Post, We talked to the EU and it refused to stop funding for the organizations, so Israel took this step of designating the organizations as terrorist, Al-Aboudi said.<\/p> <p>\u201cEvidence wise they have nothing,\u201d Al-Aboudi said. If Israel had real evidence it would have attacked the organizations. Any independent professional investigation would show that the dossier is based on \u201clibel, propaganda and just lies.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen we tell them, OK present that [secret evidence], let us have a chance to review the evidence, they say no we won\u2019t do it. This is state terrorism at its finest hour. Our only hope is to rely on the free people of the world to pressure their Congress, their parliament members and to pressure their governments to act and defend human rights. \u201cWhat\u2019s being targeted today is civil society, what\u2019s being targeted today is the truth, what\u2019s being targeted today is not just our work as civil society but international civil society.\u201d<\/p> <p>Sahar Francis said that the so-called evidence was gathered by Israeli security services from the military courts. She said the report was submitted in May to European government.<\/p> <p>Most of this information is based on confessions by Palestinian prisoners who are tortured and ill-treated systematically in these interrogation centers\u2026 The report\u2013 pieces were taken from interrogation sessions, and the confessions of these two prisoners out of five or six prisoners arrested\u2026<\/p> <p>Francis represents one of the prisoners, so she has seen the evidence but can\u2019t disclose it due to the military court procedure. But she knows it to be very weak, she said.<\/p> <p>Francis said the entire case is a manipulation of anti-terror laws to punish \u201chuman rights organizations that are struggling with their people to achieve self determination.\u201d Israel has used these laws for decades to target critics and to advance its annexation of the West Bank and Jerusalem.<\/p> <p>She noted that Israel\u2019s \u201cterrorist\u201d designation relies on the claim that the six organizations are tied to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. But Francis said Israel could have used any Palestinian party for this pretext, including Hamas and Fatah.<\/p> <p>Let me remind you that all the parties included in the PLO are still declared illegal in Israeli military orders and inside Israel which means that they can claim against Mr. Mahmoud Abbas himself as the Fatah leader as a criminal terrorist person. They can criminalize everyone and claim based on secret information that he is a terrorist.<\/p> <p>Shawan Jabarin of Al-Haq said he has seen the dossier that was given to Europeans and it is laughable.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is nothing\u2026. They try to throw the dust everywhere.\u201d<\/p> <p>He called on the international community to reject the allegations forcefully.<\/p> <p>I ask the US, are you willing to accept false allegation. are you ready to accept secret file. Are you ready to target civil society?\u2026 This is a test for the U.S., for the E.U., for everybody who believes in international law, human rights law and democratic standards. Palestine is a test, even a test for the international law itself\u2026 This is where we are. We will not step back. We will not give up. And the main approach is we are challenging them to prove what they say.<\/p> <p>Jabarin echoed a report in Electronic Intifada saying the EU has shown \u201cdeference\u201d to Israel over the allegations.<\/p> <p>The E.U.\u2013they didn\u2019t take a strong position. You know why? Because the E.U. is divided. There are also friends of Israel. There are also parliamentarians who receive messages from Tel Aviv not from their capitals even.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe hope is coming in the U.S. from the new generation, the progressives,\u201d Jabarin said.<\/p> <p>Fuad Abu Saif of the Union of Agricultural Workers Committees said that European donors have dismissed the Israeli report but they should speak out.<\/p> <p>One encouraging thing\u2026 They give the donors all the so-called evidence. But even the donors we had a chat with them, they are not believing what they have in their files. But you have to raise your voice, you have to response to it.<\/p> <p>Khaled Elgindy of the Middle East Institute, a sponsor of the discussion, expressed the fear that the international outrage over the Israeli designation would produce \u201clots of handwringing, a lot of disapproval,\u201d but that in the end the EU and the US will not reject the allegations but acquiesce in them.<\/p> <p>Ubai Al-Aboudi noted that he is a U.S. citizen and so are others working for the six organizations.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo we would expect Congress and we would expect the Biden administration\u2026 to take all the measures necessary to communicate with us before takiing any step.\u201d<\/p> <p>Khaled Quzmar of DCIP said the secret dossier is a \u201ctest\u201d of the Biden administration.<\/p> <p>For the Biden administration, this is the test. Are they going to continue with words and no action? It will be no different from the Trump administration. [If there is] no political will to hold Israel responsible for crimes, I conclude that they are partner in the crimes.<\/p> <p>Jabarin said that the U.S. should be aware that the case is undermining the Palestinian Authority by closing \u201call doors\u201d to justice.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe people they can ask, You can\u2019t protect our land, you can\u2019t protect our life, you can\u2019t protect our institutions, why you are here?\u201d<\/p> <p>He said that Al-Haq\u2019s funders and our partners \u201care doubling their funding to us. We have no lack of funding, to be honest with you.\u201d<\/p> <p>But the big question is whether the U.S. will prevent Palestinians organizations from getting money from banks under the terrorist claim.<\/p> <p>Sahar Francis called on the U.S. to pressure Israel now to withdraw the designation.<\/p> <p>[The designation] needs to be revoked under political pressure from around the world. It\u2019s the U.S. responsibility. As they support Israel, they can revoke this decision.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3HA5ODM5KC7CPY8ZUFUUGQLO9BXVSV"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1317,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Israel","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Palestinian human rights organizations","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2014","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Israel","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Palestinian human rights organizations","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":932428865,"Input.title":"Police detain Itsekiri chief over alleged kidnap, murder in Benin","Input.publish_date":"2020-06-30 13:38:46","Input.article_interface":"<p>An Itsekiri chief and Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom, Chief Johnson Atseleghe, has been detained by the police for alleged kidnap and murder.<\/p> <p>The detention was confirmed by the Edo State Police Command on Tuesday.<\/p> <p>Police Public Relations Officer of the state\u2019s command, DSP Nwabuzor Chidi, confirmed the development to journalists in Warri.<\/p> <p>He, however, did not divulge the identity of the victim allegedly murdered by the chief to journalists who called him on phone.<\/p> <p>According to him, while the chief remains in their custody, an investigation is ongoing to unravel the allegations.<\/p> <p>Tribune Online gathered that what led to the alleged kidnap and killing might not be unconnected to the lingering land feud between the Itsekiri and Bini people in Ologbo community in Edo State.<\/p> <p>The feud, it was learnt, has allegedly claimed lives on the sides of both brothers in the border community between Edo and Delta states<\/p> <p>An heir of the Itsekiri royal stool in Warri, Prince Yemi Emiko, who confirmed the arrest of the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom to journalists in a telephone chat, however, accused the police of compromise.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe matter really is that, Yes; the guy is with the Police.

Outside, the apple trees are in bloom. But in villages spread across Pulwama and Shopian in south Kashmir, long considered by the authorities to be the centre of militant activity, young men and their families are saying they have been subject to violence, even torture, at the hands of Indian soldiers. Some have spoken on record to the international press about severe beatings, even electric shocks. A report by a group of women fact-finders who visited Kashmir in September alleged that some 13,000 boys, many as young as 14, have been held in prisons for weeks. While there is no official confirmation of these numbers, the government admitted to a Supreme Court-appointed committee that 144 boys, some as young as nine, have been arrested since August 5 for stone-pelting.<\/p> <p>But the young man in Arihal, in his 20s, says he was just working his paddy field with his wife when soldiers assaulted him on September 28. \"Three soldiers held me down,\" he alleges. They covered his mouth so he couldn't scream and then, \"one of the soldiers punched me until I bled.\" The other two \"thrashed my body and legs and hurled abuses at me\", he says. \"Then they asked me to kneel in the sun and hold my head between my knees while the blood dripped from my nose and mouth.\"<\/p> <p>Not long after the assault, the young man fainted. He woke up in a government hospital in Pulwama, where the doctors noted his case down as an \"alleged assault\". The army, he says, wanted to know who had invited a \"maulvi\" to address the congregation on Friday at a mosque in his village. As we journalists left his home that afternoon, a group of soldiers, maybe half a dozen, appeared in the neighbourhood in black combat fatigues.<\/p> <p>In Pulwama's Chandgam village, consisting of more than 2,000 households, you see only elderly men on the streets, gossiping behind the shutters of shops closed to business or hailing a ride from a passing car. The young men are either indoors, scared to attract attention, or have run away from their homes altogether so as not to be found by soldiers.<\/p> <p>Despite the many reports of arrests and violence inflicted on young men, the army has steadfastly denied all allegations of torture. Chandan Kohli, the superintendent of police in Pulwama, says he has not received any complaint of torture or even harassment. \"The villagers should come to me,\" he says, \"but there have been zero complaints.\"<\/p> <p>Colonel Rajesh Kalia, the army spokesman in Srinagar, also gives short shrift to any talk of torture. But at the hospital in Pulwama, senior doctors tell harrowing stories of treating young men who have clearly been victims of assault amounting to torture. One doctor said he treated five men who had sustained serious injuries to their ear drums. Another man's buttocks were swollen and blue from the severity of his beating. \"In 2016,\" he says, referring to the months of unrest after security forces killed Burhan Wani, commander of separatist group Hizbul Mujahideen, \"we'd be treating lots of young men wounded by pellet guns. But in the last two months, we have been receiving patients who have been beaten.\"<\/p> <p>(Photo: ANI)<\/p> <p>Army chief General Bipin Rawat has been quoted in interviews saying he would \"personally order a full-fledged probe\" should any \"victim\" come forward with an allegation of torture. \"But\", he added, \"I can say for sure that no such action has taken place.\" The Pulwama police is investigating one allegation of torture by the army. On September 17, 15-year-old Yawar Ahmad Bhat, from Chandgam, drank poison. He died two days later in hospital. His family says he was detained and beaten by soldiers the day before he took the poison.<\/p> <p>Where are the restrictions? It is only in your mind. There are no restrictions. Only misinformation about restrictions is being spread... Lack of phone connection is not a human rights violation - Union home minister Amit Shah assured participants at a seminar, in Delhi on September 29, that all was well in Kashmir<\/p> <p>\"Last year, he dropped out of school,\" says Bhat's father. \"His cousin and classmate had been injured by a pellet gun. He was working at an auto workshop, but this year both boys were going to take their exams.\" Bhat's family says the soldiers stopped him when he was on his way to buy paint for a car on which his shop was working \"discreetly\" because all commercial establishments had been shuttered since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. Bhat was beaten, his identity card seized and he was told to report to a nearby camp the next morning. His fear of what would be done to him at the camp, his father says, is what drove him to suicide. Kohli says the investigation into Bhat's suicide is still in its early stages, but the army has already described the family's claims as \"baseless\".<\/p> <p>After releasing their report, the all-women fact-finding team called for an inquiry into the allegations of torture. But Bhat's father is despondent. \"I won't allow my son's body to be exhumed for an autopsy, so that there can be a 'probe'. I know justice won't follow.\"<\/p> <p>Speaking of justice, the Supreme Court has decided to allow the government four weeks to file counter-affidavits to the petitions filed about the constitutionality of its decision to abrogate Article 370.

As per the news item, Dr. Rukshan Bellana, President of the Government Medical Officers\u2019 Forum, has told that the health service is maintained by the taxes levied on the people of the country and if they have any problems, a civilized society will not allow them to take the patients hostage without resolving them through negotiations. He also said that this was being done as a trade union struggle to do what the political parties wanted and that the trade unions affiliated to the political parties\u2019 should be banned and that the people should unite against such rallies. He said that some of the trade union-based instances and attempts to base themselves on various demands such as going to parliament from national lists and requesting ministerial posts in ministries.<\/p> <p>Although Dr Bellana has not named the individuals who are currently posing as trade union leaders, we are fully aware of how a trade union activist attached to the health sector entered the parliament for a week or two via the national list for his political services rendered to the Yahapalana government. What he did to the duty free vehicle license thus obtained has become an interesting issue. The easiest way to find out how they even contributed to the continuation of terrorism in the past is to search their records on line. Interestingly, I found a list of names of the trade union activists attached to the Health services among the list of politicians, so-called civil societies and trade union activists, who were promoting LTTE as an integral part of \u2018the solution\u2019 and campaigning in support of the CFA in 2006, in a pro LTTE website (https:\/\/www.tamilnet.com\/art.html?artid=19261&catid=13).<\/p> <p>Freedom to involve in strikes were very limited (or not at all) for the government employees prior to 1956. As a result of granting some freedom to the government and public sector employees affiliated to political parties in 1956, we remember how trade unions of \u2018comrades\u2019 political parties who called upon workers to \u2018establish an administration of the working class\u2019 started strikes throughout the country even for extremely minor issues. While addressing a public meeting during the 1960 elections held after the assassination of SWRD, Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranike stated how those \u2018comrades\u2019 parties, \u2018politically killed him without physically killing\u2019 (\u2018\u2019nomara maruwa\u2019\u2019) her husband by promoting strikes. By allowing politicians of successive governments to interfere with the appointments of various positions within the public service, the government servants and their trade unions are politically divided to an uncontrollable extent today. I remember, as a former employee, how those \u2018comrades\u2019 started their first ever strike in the then Ceylon Steel Corporation in 1969 and how they attempted to achieve their dream of \u2018an administration of the working class\u2019 by chasing away forcefully the non union members and the leading administration including the Chairman and the General Manger from the site, after their failed strike and return back to work. Some of the officers had to runaway for fear of life and finally, the then the Minister of Industries Mr Phiip Gunawardana had to interfere and ensure their safety for them to reenter the Corporation site.<\/p> <p>Although right to strikes is considered as a human right and recognized in almost all so-called democratic champion countries, they have introduced legislations to regulate the strike actions. In particular; they impose limitations for the strikes of workers in public essential services, such as health, security, movements, assistance and welfare, education, and communications.<\/p> <p>In the UK, strike action organized by a trade union is legal provided some tough conditions are met. For example: The union must have conducted a lawful ballot of all the members it believes will be called upon to take part. In Australia, there may be a right to strike in limited circumstances, but in practice there is no right to strike, except for exceptional circumstances.<\/p> <p>Under Australian laws, strikes can only happen during bargaining. At all other times they are unlawful.<\/p> <p>Even during bargaining there are too many hurdles. Before workers can take a bargaining strike they must prove that they are genuinely trying to reach agreement, hold a secret ballot, give their employer three clear days notice of the strike etc. If a strike happens outside of bargaining then workers and their unions face dire consequences.<\/p> <p>The employer can:<\/p> <p>Gets an automatic order from the Fair Work Commission requiring a return to work.<\/p> <p>Get injunctions from Federal and State Courts.<\/p> <p>Discipline workers or sack them.<\/p> <p>Sue unions and workers for contempt of court if orders or injunctions are not followed to the letter.<\/p> <p>Sue the workers and their union under various laws for fines up to $10,800 for workers and $54,000 for unions.<\/p> <p>Seek compensation against workers and their unions for lost revenue.<\/p> <p>Even if the employer doesn\u2019t want to take legal action, government agencies, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Australian Building and Construction Commission can initiate such actions.<\/p> <p>I spent almost half of employment life outside Sri Lanka including African and Pacific regions, I have not come across or even seen a single strike in those countries similar to what is going on in Sri Lanka. Considering the inconvenience caused to the general public, while accepting the right to strikes, the government should take necessary steps to regulate the strike actions, at least, in public essential services similar to what the other countries do in the world.<\/p> <p>S.

There, I represented dozens of asylum-seekers in both affirmative and defensive asylum claims during the Bush and Obama administrations.<\/p> <p>The vast majority of our clients entered through the southern border. They were fleeing violence from every corner of the world: Eritrea, Egypt, Iran, Chad, Cuba, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Nepal \u2013 and yes, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, too.<\/p> <p>Last summer, I led an effort to provide legal information regarding credible fear interviews to over 300 asylum-seekers transferred straight from the southern border to a county jail in Albany, New York. They came from 39 different countries and spoke 19 different languages.<\/p> <p>To qualify for asylum in the United States, an individual must show that they have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution in the future on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.<\/p> <p>Courts have interpreted membership in a particular social group to include claims involving persecution due to gender, sexual orientation, family affiliation and other types of persecution that the government cannot or will not prevent.<\/p> <p>One of my former clients, a human rights worker from a country in Africa, narrowly escaped death after having been imprisoned and tortured by her own government. She swam across the Rio Grande to seek safety in the United States after catching a flight to Central America and making her perilous journey north. She was eight months pregnant. When she arrived in our office with her husband, also a refugee and also a client, she was days away from giving birth and in crippling distress.<\/p> <p>Months later, after giving birth, she and her husband, were granted asylum by an immigration judge.

They might make it to the front of the line, only to be turned away under the new policies. Immigration judges presiding remotely over closed hearings from the United States can decide that under the new policy, an individual is required to seek asylum in one of the countries they passed through before arriving in Mexico.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s say that country is Guatemala, one of the countries that asylees traveling by land from anywhere in Central or South America must pass through in order to reach Mexico. The U.S. State Department indicates that Guatemala \u201cremains among the most dangerous countries in the world,\u201d due to \u201cendemic poverty, an abundance of weapons, a legacy of societal violence, and the presence of organized criminal gangs.\u201d<\/p> <p>This small, troubled country now has a long line of asylum applications to process, which it is already ill-equipped to do. Guatemala\u2019s asylum system has been characterized by immigration experts as \u201cembryonic.\u201d As of Aug. 2, its four asylum officers had not resolved any of the 423 cases awaiting a decision.<\/p> <p>Many asylees will likely face difficulty traveling back to Guatemala, El Salvador or other common waypoints. Even if they did, they would find no protection there and little chance to survive in a country struggling to keep its own citizens safe.<\/p> <p>Legal challenges<\/p> <p>Many of the over 10,000 migrants waiting at the border \u2013 whose numbers are growing daily \u2013 face similar dangers.<\/p> <p>Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported on the kidnapping of a family of four awaiting their chance to seek asylum. That story cited a human rights report cataloging more than 110 cases of violent crimes against asylum-seekers waiting as a result of the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, during observations of hearings at the border in June and July.<\/p> <p>So far, lawsuits challenging this ban have failed. The most recent legal challenge, filed on Sept. 16, is on behalf of more than 100 migrant mothers and children directly impacted by the asylum ban.<\/p> <p>That lawsuit documents and challenges the inconsistent implementation of the policy. For example, the first step in articulating an asylum claim at the border is a process called a \u201ccredible fear interview.\u201d Under the asylum ban, individuals have not been provided legal orientation regarding the new processes for these interviews. Some have been subjected to multiple interviews over long periods of time. Meanwhile, untrained border patrol officers, rather than trained asylum officers, are now conducting the interviews.<\/p> <p>As renewed legal challenges make their way through the courts, I fear that families will continue disappearing, violent attacks on refugees will increase, and the human toll will be irreversible.<\/p> <p>[ Deep knowledge, daily.

The reporters, moreover, cited chat logs and other documents provided by Thordarson, which they say substantiates his admission to have lied for the indictment.<\/p> <p>The silence is all the more striking given that many of the publications maintaining it, such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, the British Guardian and the Sydney Morning Herald, have published editorials and\/or opinion pieces branding the attempted US prosecution of Assange as a threat to journalism and press freedom.<\/p> <p>Those statements, however, all had a pro forma character. They were couched in the most tepid and non-committal terms, and were not accompanied by any concrete actions or campaign for Assange\u2019s freedom.<\/p> <p>In fact, over the past two years, one could chart a law of diminishing returns in the corporate media coverage of Assange. The more the US-led pursuit of Assange has been exposed as a politically-motivated frame-up, the less the newspapers have published about the WikiLeaks founder. The same goes for publicly-funded outlets that claim to offer impartial reportage, untainted by the editorial influence of private owners, such as the British and Australian broadcasting corporations.<\/p> <p>Julian Assange<\/p> <p>Outlets that previously reported every smear and slander against Assange with relish, have increasingly dropped his case altogether. The 2019 finding by United Nations Rapporteur Nils Melzer that the persecution of Assange amounted to state torture was given short shrift. So was the final collapse of Swedish sexual misconduct allegations, which had been used against the WikiLeaks founder for the best part of a decade, including by the media, but never made it past the \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d phase.<\/p> <p>Revelations that the US Central Intelligence Agency had illegally spied on Assange and all his associates, while he was a political refugee in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, were given scant attention, as were reports that this campaign included discussion of kidnapping and murdering the WikiLeaks founder. The same was the case for warnings, including by prominent doctors, that Assange could die in a British prison due to the deterioration of his health, and the powerful defence testimony during the extradition hearings last September.<\/p> <p>In other words, the official media has largely run cover for the US government and Justice Department, as the operation to prosecute a journalist has unravelled.<\/p> <p>There is a particular reason, however, why the major publications are especially intent on covering up the Stundin revelations. For years, they have sought to justify their participation in what Melzer aptly termed the \u201cpublic mobbing\u201d of Assange, by questioning or dismissing his journalistic credentials.<\/p> <p>The corporate outlets criticised the Trump administration\u2019s Espionage Act charges against Assange, primarily from the standpoint of their potential implications for the mainstream media, while claiming that Assange was a \u201cpolarising figure,\u201d a \u201cbad actor\u201d and worse. The main argument they set upon was that Assange was something other than a journalist or publisher. He was an \u201cactivist\u201d at best, a \u201ccomputer hacker\u201d at worst.<\/p> <p>The US incorporated Thordarson\u2019s lies into a superseding indictment against Assange, issued in June 2020, precisely to bolster this narrative, and to obscure the fact that the attempted prosecution was an attack on press freedom. Thordarson\u2019s tales of having conspired with Assange to secretly record the conversations of Icelandic politicians, hack into banks and commit other cyber-crimes, are presented in the indictment as fact, and proof that the WikiLeaks founder is nothing more than a common criminal.<\/p> <p>When the indictment was released, Thordarson\u2019s credibility was already low. He had previously been convicted in an Icelandic court of impersonating Assange, stealing tens of thousands of dollars from WikiLeaks, and molesting underage boys. The psychiatric assessment presented to those hearings was hardly a glowing character reference, describing the Icelandic man as a sociopath.<\/p> <p>The indictment and Thordarson, however, received limited media scrutiny, because his lies dovetailed with those of the corporate press. Now that he has walked back the claims, nothing is said or written.<\/p> <p>The response to the Stundin report brands the official media as an adjunct of governments and the intelligence agencies. The Assange case has revealed the willingness of almost the entire corporate media to facilitate and aid a state campaign aimed at destroying a journalist for exposing war crimes, global diplomatic intrigues and government surveillance operations.<\/p> <p>The despicable role played by the press has served to undermine the widespread public support that Assange has won for his journalistic exposures, and to create an environment in which governments feel emboldened to be ever-more brazen in their persecution of him. The same function has been played by a host of pseudo-left and trade union organisations, which once claimed to support Assange, but abandoned him long ago.<\/p> <p>The Stundin episode again demonstrates that any perspective of securing Assange\u2019s freedom by issuing plaintive appeals to the official institutions of capitalist society, including the corporate media, amounts to a fool\u2019s errand.<\/p> <p>In its own way, the media silence indicates the real constituency for the defence of Assange and all democratic rights. The blackout of the Thordarson revelations is a tacit acknowledgement that if the details of Assange\u2019s plight were widely known and discussed, they would provoke mass outrage and opposition from ordinary people. It is the working class, increasingly being propelled into struggle against inequality, austerity and war, that can defeat state frame-ups and guarantee democratic rights, if it is politically-educated and mobilised.<\/p> <p>Finally, the episode demonstrates the crucial importance of the fight against online censorship. But for Stundin\u2019s initial article and reports about it by a handful of alternative and anti-war publications, Thordarson\u2019s admission that the US indictment is based on lies would not have appeared anywhere on the entire internet.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3PMR2DOWOQGCPJR9YNGZEPBJI4B544"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":639,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"WikiLeaks, extradition, Sweden, UK, USA","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"WikiLeaks, extradition, Sweden, UK, USA","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1007233228,"Input.title":"Kidnapping gang busted in Afghanistan's Kabul","Input.publish_date":"2021-10-02 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>KABUL, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban forces busted a kidnapping gang, arresting four suspects in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman confirmed on Saturday.<\/p> <p>\"Mujahideen of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan arrested four kidnappers following an operative task in Sarak-e-Dowam area of Police District 8 in Kabul,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid wrote on Twitter.<\/p> <p>Those among the arrested were two women and the body of a teenage girl was also found in the house following the raid which took place on Friday.<\/p> <p>The suspects were shifted to an intelligence agency directorate for identification process and questioning.

He said the opposition MPs would stay away for two weeks.<\/p> <p>The opposition MPs possibly hoped for at least two outcomes from their walk out; first that, even if just for a few minutes, the business of parliament would be interrupted if not stopped. That did not happen.<\/p> <p>Instead the Deputy Speak of Parliament, Anita Annet Among, encourage David Bahati (Ndorwa West); the minister of State for Industry, to carry on business as usual.<\/p> <p>The opposition MPs possibly also hoped that at least some conscientious protesters among their colleagues from the ruling party and the Independents would join them. That too did not happen. The question now is why?<\/p> <p>Among those currently in detention and allegedly tortured, are two MPs Muhammad Ssegirinya (Kawempe North) and Allan Sewanyana (Makindye West).<\/p> <p>But the two recent torture cases that have led Ugandans to fear the dark days of the regimes of then-presidents Idi Amin Dada (1971-79) and Milton Obote (1980-85) when soldiers and security agencies could pick up anyone, anywhere, at any time without explain and detain, toruture and kill many of them.<\/p> <p>On Feb.01, the biggest opposition political party in parliament; the National Unity Platform (NUP) paraded its coordinator for Kasese District, Samuel Masereka, to the media with wounds all over his body. They said the wounds resulted from torture he experienced while in military detection in Mbuya CMI headquarters in Kampala. Masereka who was being supported to walk had bodily injuries on legs and feet. His back was spread with bruises of canes.<\/p> <p>Masereka had been abducted from his home in Kasese on December 07, 2021. He said his abductors first took him to the Kasese Central Police station from where a \"drone\" omnibus van drove him at breakneck speed for two hours within Kasese town and later to Mbuya CMI headquarters. From Mbuya, Masereka said he was beaten in turns while being asked what NUP's plan for Rwenzori was. For the 34 days he was detained, Masereka said he was being beaten every day, asked the plans of NUP, their source of funds, and threatened that he could be killed without trace.<\/p> <p>In another case, a video circulating on social media sites shows an undressed Kakwenza Rukirabashaija; the internationally recognised writer of fiction, displaying alleged marks of torture he says he suffered in detention recently. The video showed Kakwenza's bum, back, and thighs; all with scars that have recently healed. Those scars according to Kakwenza were inflicted on him through beatings while in military detention. Kakwenza says the bruises and scars are a result of beating meted out on him by his captors; a section of Uganda's security forces.<\/p> <p>Kakwenza was violently arrested in Kisasi, Kampala, held for weeks in unknown place where neither his family member nor his lawyer could be allowed to see him. He was later to briefly appear at his Iganga home where it was discovered he had been subjected to torture.<\/p> <p>From Iganga, Kakwenza was again held incommunicado. Later on, he was arraigned in court and charged with offensive communication under the Computer Misuse Act in which he was accused of abusing President Yoweri Museveni and his son, Lt. Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba. While in Kitalya mini maximum prison, a medical officer counted over 60 freshly cut wounds on Kakwenza's body resulting from beatings he experienced while incommunicado arrest.<\/p> <p>Ruling party silent<\/p> <p>Torture is prohibited under international law. Ugandan law also protects the right to freedom from torture. Article 24 of the 1995 Constitution of Uganda states: \"No person shall be subjected to any form of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" To supplement this article of the Constitution, torture is also criminalised by the Prevention and Prohibition of Torture Act (2012).<\/p> <p>In spite of the available legal framework and the human rights laws, Uganda's security forces continue to torture suspects with impunity. The recent case of Kasese NUP coordinator, Kakwenza and others who have been subjected to torture show that holding individual security personnel who torture citizens accountable is still an uphill task as these are shielded by the regime.<\/p> <p>As a protest repeated acts of torture and human rights violations in the country, the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Parliament led a walk out of opposition legislators on February 3.<\/p> <p>The LoP, Mathias Mpuuga, said the opposition will boycott parliament sittings for two weeks.<\/p> <p>The Deputy Speaker Anita Among, said the appropriate solution would be for the LoP to come with a motion that seeks to debate and address the issue of torture. The deputy speaker reiterated that earlier on parliament had given Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja two weeks to brief the House on allegations of torture. The two weeks will end on 8 February.<\/p> <p>After the session, the Minister of ICT and National Guidance, Dr Chris Baryomnsi said the ruling government does not condone torture.<\/p> <p>\"If any suspect or person is tortured in an established prison, the security officers of that institution should be held accountable for their actions,\" Baryomunsi said.<\/p> <p>But allegations of torture in parliament are not new. On May 23, 2017, Kasilo County MP Elijah Okupa (FDC) made the following motion in parliament (in part): The third issue I want to raise is on Makindye Military Barracks. That is another place where torture has infiltrated and been meted on Ugandans. Honourable minister, we would like to know what is happening there. The committee should also interest itself in that place and go there.<\/p> <p>\"I am a victim of torture. I went through what Members are talking about here in 1988. Hon. Gutomoi has also been a victim. Hon. Mayende Dede, from your side, went through the same situation of torture one time. The honourable Dr Chris Baryomunsi knows what he went through and how I was protected in Jinja Police Station by fellow inmates. They said, \"This is what happens here\". When we were commissioners, you know what happened.\"<\/p> <p>On August 14, 2021 President Yoweri Museveni addressed the nation on the issue of security force personnel that torture suspects. In a televised address, Museveni spoke tough against torturing suspects. He said officers who use torture to obtain information are \"lazy\". He warned security forces against barking at or beating suspects, detaining suspects for long periods in jail and deporting foreigners without trial, saying it disadvantages the country.<\/p> <p>To illustrate his point, in that address, the President asked for videos to be played of suspects arrested in the trial of the attempted assassination of former Chief of Defense Forces General Edward Katumba Wamala.<\/p> <p>One video showed a suspect sobbing in court, saying he was beaten with various canes, which made him say things he should not be saying. Others showed a man with raw torture wounds on his back, a tortured man limping out of court, and police officer running after a woman and beating her repeatedly. Museveni said these were acts by individual officers and the failure of senior commanders.<\/p> <p>\"Beating captives [suspects] is wrong. Why? You undermine your case in court -- when the court discovered that you got information through torture. Secondly, on account of beating, somebody may admit what is not true. Torture, assassination, et cetera, are used by lazy people that are not ready to do more work using gaps in the stories of the criminals if they are telling lies,\" he said. Museveni promised to eliminate such torture.<\/p> <p>Two days after the Presidential address against torture, the Inspector General of Police, Martins Okoth Ochola, issued a statement saying he had tasked the police's Directorate of Human Rights and Legal Services to list all accused police officers for prosecution.<\/p> <p>\"There is no justification whatsoever under any circumstances or orders from a superior officer or public authority for torture,\" he said in a statement issued on August 16, 2021.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Uganda Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Suspects continue to complain of being tortured while in detention. The police force has normalised beating up journalists whenever they want to hide human rights violations.<\/p> <p>Several human rights reports, including some by the government's Uganda Human Rights Commission, have ranked Uganda's security forces including the police and Uganda Peoples Defence Force (UPDF) as the lead perpetrators of human rights violations particularly torture and cruel, inhuman degrading treatment or punishment.<\/p> <p>Human rights activists now say President Museveni's condemnation of torture allegedly committed by police and the armed forces was \"cosmetic\". They want to see action taken on perpetrators of torture.<\/p> <p>Livingston Sewanyana, Executive Director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, said: \"There's still a class of people who are increasingly being untouchable, and the President needs them for his political survival. So, much as he comes out as strong, with warnings, he definitely does not live up to his words. And the way politics is played here, it is all about who has the president's ear.\"<\/p> <p>Samuel Nsubuga, CEO of the non-government organization the African Center for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, says the president needs to act.<\/p> <p>\"I would like those people who did that to the suspects to be prosecuted in the courts of law. There's that gap which we really want the justice institutions to fill,\" Nsubuga said.<\/p> <p>Political activist and former FDC president, Dr. Kizza Besigye said the goal of torture is to scare Ugandans from demanding for a free and fair society.<\/p> <p>\"The people's desire for freedom and fulfilment is far great than the terror any tyrant can project. The pictures of the Museveni junta's recent torture victims like writer Kakwenza Rukirabashaija and Kasese District NUP Coordinator Samuel Masereka. These only prove the barbarism.

Aggett did not commit suicide, there was foul play and his death by hanging in the John Vorster Square police cells came about as a result of the \u201cdirect acts\u201d of Security Branch officers, Varney said.<\/p> <p>He added that should the court find that Aggett died by suicide, it had to be induced suicide arising from Aggett\u2019s prolonged detention of 70 days and sustained assault, torture and trauma inflicted on him in during the weeks, days and hours leading up to his death on 5 February 1982.<\/p> <p>Both Varney and the National Prosecuting Authority\u2019s (NPA\u2019s) Advocate Jabulani Mlotshwa argued that the forensic testimony presented in the reopened inquest pointed to a conclusion that Aggett could not have climbed his cell bars in the second floor of the John Vorster Square police station to hang himself. More likely, they maintained, is that evidence presented suggested that Aggett\u2019s hanging was staged after he was rendered into a state of unconsciousness or low consciousness.<\/p> <p>Along with this forensic testimony, Mlotshwa argued that had Aggett committed suicide, his chief interrogator, Lieutenant Steven Whitehead, and Sergeant Paul Erasmus (who testified in 2020) would not have gone to the extraordinary lengths they did \u2013 including at one point gaining illegal entry into Aggett\u2019s parents\u2019 home \u2013 to try to find \u201cevidence\u201d that Aggett had suicidal tendencies.<\/p> <p>Whitehead died in April 2019, just days before the NPA announced the inquest would be reopened. This followed years of inaction from the NPA around reopening the inquest into Aggett\u2019s death, which was among about 300 cases involving deaths and disappearances of anti-apartheid activists that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission had recommend for further investigation in 2003.<\/p> <p>Whitehead, dead at 62, reportedly from cancer, went to his grave without having to answer in a courtroom. Over the past 18 months though, he has been cast by his former colleagues as an upstart, willing to bend the rules to climb the ranks and to prove himself in the Security Branch. He was described as a party animal, a boozer and a daddy\u2019s boy and was regarded as untouchable, being on the receiving end of privilege and protection through nepotism.<\/p> <p>Mlotshwa also said Whitehead had a fixation with Aggett, a blinding obsession almost, that made his cruelty towards the young doctor explicit, although evidence presented to the court showed that Aggett was not involved with a banned organisation or any underground organisation \u2013 he was interested in fighting for workers\u2019 rights, which wasn\u2019t an illegal activity.<\/p> <p>But Whitehead and others ensured his torture in detention included electric shocks, beatings, sleep deprivation and physical and verbal abuse over an extended period \u2013 hallmarks of his interrogation and efforts to extract a confession from Aggett.<\/p> <p>The court also heard that Whitehead and the head of the Security Branch at the time, Major Arthur Conwright, were likely out to prove that they were close to piecing together a case that would be as explosive as \u201cthe next Treason Trial\u201d. It would be a significant breakthrough to quash an uprising against the National Party regime.<\/p> <p>Whitehead and Conwright, both now dead, left it to their colleagues that could be tracked down over the past few years to take the stand in the reopened inquest.<\/p> <p>Testimony these former cops gave over the past 18 months was almost uniformly marked by a refusal to divulge specifics, a defence of foggy memories lost to the passing decades, or a portrayal of close and cosy relationships with detainees who were well cared for. They said if torture or abuse had occurred they never heard or saw it happen and they never took part in any acts of torture or violence themselves.<\/p> <p>They also gave testimony of oaths of silence among the Security Branch members and acknowledged that members were an inner sanctum within the police and operated with their own codes and culture. Testimony was given that this routinely included the likes of cover-ups, falsifying registers and documentation, rigging identity parades and \u201cnot splitting on each other\u201d.<\/p> <p>Mlotshwa and Varney, in their separate closing statements, called these witnesses \u201cunreliable\u201d, \u201cbrazen liars\u201d and \u201cconspirators in cover-ups and suppression\u201d.<\/p> <p>Varney\u2019s recommendation to the court was that the findings in the original inquest, that Aggett died by suicide and that no one could be held responsible for his death, be overturned.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is a ruling that is deeply hurtful and an affront to Neil Aggett\u2019s family and friends. It remains a stain on history and the Security Branch officers must be held to account,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Varney asked the court to recommend that in addition to a charge of perjury that Nicolaas Deetlefs also be charged for Aggett\u2019s murder. This Varney said is based on Deetlefs\u2019s evidence that he considered Aggett a suicide risk but even so failed to notify the officer in charge of detainees or to report his concerns about Aggett\u2019s wellbeing to anyone who could have put in safeguards to protect him from self-harm.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe was acutely aware of what Conwright and Whitehead were doing and had a heightened legal duty to act, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d Varney said.<\/p> <p>Varney also called for the courts to ensure that Security Branch officers Joseph Petrus Woensdregt, Daniel Elhardhus Swanepoel, Roelof Venter and Eddie Chauke be made to \u201cface consequences for their brazen lies\u201d to the court.<\/p> <p>In his closing arguments, Advocate Stephanus Coetzee, acting for Martin Naude, Venter and Deetlefs, centred on Whitehead as \u201cthe main person\u201d involved with Aggett\u2019s interrogations, not his clients. He said officers like Naude and Deetlefs were only pulled into Aggett\u2019s interrogation as stand-ins and for short periods. Deetlefs, he said, spent just nine hours with Aggett and Venter had no direct interaction with the activist.<\/p> <p>Coetzee and Advocate Ashika Ramlaal, acting on behalf of Woensdregt, Johannes Visser and Swanepoel, maintained that the clue to knowing what led to Aggett\u2019s death comes down to the 15 hours before it occurred. It was at this time that Aggett made a complaint about a particularly severe interrogation he had suffered on 4 January 1982. He named Whitehead as well as a Sergeant James van Schalkwyk as the men who tortured him, as Chauke watched.<\/p> <p>Coetzee said Aggett was at the point of filing the complaint \u201cnot under duress\u201d and had \u201cregained enough self-confidence to confront his abusers\u201d. It demonstrated, Coetzee argued, that what came before the filing of the complaint could have no bearing on what caused Aggett\u2019s death 15 hours later. Ramlaal also made this submission.<\/p> <p>Coetzee also said Deetlefs would not have been able to report Aggett as a suicide risk because of \u201chierarchies of power and line functions\u201d in police reporting protocol. He also argued that Deetlefs had not misled the court even when he repeatedly said he couldn\u2019t remember specifics. Coetzee said it would have been more suspicious had Deetlefs remembered every detail after nearly 40 years.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt best the court can come to a probable finding but there is no evidence of direct murder,\u201d Coetzee said.<\/p> <p>Judgment is reserved.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3FJ2RVH251LLNSEYXZASXQJNKP0294"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":361,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"1982.0","month":"February","date":"5.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Neil Aggett","victim_keywords":"doctor, trade union organiser, murder, staged suicide, John Vorster Square","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"1982.0","month":"February","date":"5.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Neil Aggett","victim_keywords":"doctor, trade union organiser, murder, staged suicide, John Vorster Square","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":988093597,"Input.title":"Gambia: Testimony Concludes On Alleged Atrocities Under Gambian Ex-Dictator Jammeh's Rule","Input.publish_date":"2021-06-02 06:17:03","Input.article_interface":"<p>Gambia's truth commission has wrapped up more than two years of public hearings into alleged human rights violations committed during the 22-year rule of former dictator Yahya Jammeh.<\/p> <p>A steady parade of witnesses concluded their testimony Friday, delivering accounts of arbitrary arrests, torture, corruption and summary executions, in some cases with the victims' bodies fed to crocodiles.<\/p> <p>Jammeh took power in a 1994 military coup, controlling the tiny West African nation until losing the presidency to Adama Barrow in a December 2016 election.

BY SIMON KOLAWOLE<\/p> <p>Recent events in south-western Nigeria, as I would offer to think, are not ordinary. First, Chief Sunday Adeyemo (also called Sunday Igboho), a private citizen described as \u201cyouth leader\u201d, stormed the Fulani community in Igangan, Oyo state, and gave them seven days to vacate the land, failing which he would expel them. The \u201cgrassroots mobiliser\u201d confronted the Seriki Fulani, Alhaji Saliu Kadri, accusing his kinsmen of killing Yoruba people. After issuing his ultimatum, Igboho said: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I just commanded the Fulani to leave our land or that I suddenly said something arbitrarily. For like two weeks now, these Fulani people in Ibarapa have been killing our people.\u201d<\/p> <p>Second, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo state issued another seven-day ultimatum to Fulani herdsmen to vacate the state\u2019s forest reserves. The deadline is today. He has banned night-grazing and movement of cattle within cities and highways. He has also outlawed what he called \u201cunder-aged grazing\u201d \u2014 which I must presume are the young herders. His Riot Act has been opposed by presidency and prominent northern elders. There is a debate on the constitutionality of his order. Akeredolu, though, does not seem to bother. He has ordered massive recruitment into Amotekun \u2014 the south-west quasi-state police outfit \u2014 ahead of the operations to flush out Fulani herders.<\/p> <p>Why is Akeredolu so incensed? Bad elements, he said, have turned the forest reserves into hideouts for keeping victims of kidnapping, negotiating for ransom and carrying out \u201cother criminal activities\u201d. The governor asked those who wish to carry on with their cattle-rearing business \u201cto register with the appropriate authorities\u201d. Igboho, on his part, has defended his unilateral action. \u201cSome are saying I am not in government and that I am meddling with what does not concern me. If there is a government and it is not doing what it is supposed to do, the people that voted will rise up,\u201d he explained. In other words, there will be something like free-for-all \u2014 as we see in failed states.<\/p> <p>Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo state is more temperate in his own reaction. He has come out clearly against ethnic profiling. Labelling every Fulani a kidnapper, armed robber and murderer is unhelpful as far as he is concerned. Focus should be on the criminals, not the ethnic group, he warned. Makinde also had a dig at Igboho, whom many describe as a political agent rather than a youth leader. \u201cFor people stoking ethnic tension, they are criminals and once you get them, they should be arrested and treated like common criminals,\u201d Makinde told the police commissioner, adding that they cannot hide \u201cunder the guise of protecting Yoruba\u2019s interest\u201d to perpetuate chaos.<\/p> <p>Events are unfolding at a rapid pace. Houses owned by Fulani people have been burnt in Igangan after the expiration of Igboho\u2019s ultimatum. On Saturday, Mallam Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, announced that the inspector-general of police has issued an order for the arrest of Igboho for the eviction notice. Ordinarily, such an announcement should be coming from the police authorities and not presidential spokesman. But it is what it is. The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), the northern group, has warned that the attacks on Fulani communities in the south-west can lead to war. Afenifere, the Yoruba group, has described ACF\u2019s statement as \u201cinsulting and arrogant\u201d.<\/p> <p>Indeed, the eviction notices to Fulani communities offer a different dimension to the security crises. There are many scenarios running through my head, but this particular one scares me: the notice expires; Amotekun launches an operation to evict them; they resist; they get killed; their bodies are taken to the north for burial; Fulani groups reinforce and launch reprisals \u2014 which, from experience, can become protracted and gruesome; Yoruba villages come under regular attacks; Yoruba youth groups take revenge on other northerners in the south-west; northerners attack Yoruba up north; and we end up with thousands of dead bodies in a number of states. Not looking good at all.<\/p> <p>That is why I would rather suggest, or plead, that our immediate concern should be how to de-escalate the tension rather than fuel it. The easiest thing to say is \u201clet us go to war\u201d. Many people who witnessed the End SARS uprising in Lagos will testify that it was not a pleasant experience \u2014 and this was far from being a war. I have discussed with many Nigerians who witnessed the civil war from 1967 to 1970 and most of them always pray that Nigeria would never go to war again. There is hardly any Igbo family that did not lose a loved one during the war. War mongering is sweet on Twitter but the actual event is not a tea party. I would appeal to our leaders to curb the war rhetoric.<\/p> <p>Here is my take on the situation. First, it boils down to one thing: the feeling that the security agencies are not doing enough to curtail the criminalities in the region. Igboho said if the government would not do something, the people would rise up and protect themselves. This is a major red flag for state failure. The moment government loses monopoly of use of legitimate force, militias will fill in the gap. The signs are already everywhere: citizens are forming vigilante groups because the security agencies are ineffective. Citizens have lost faith in the ability of the state to enforce law and order, to protect life and property. This is what you see in Somalia and Syria.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, it does not help that there is a theory that the Fulani have an agenda to take over the whole of Nigeria and \u201cdip the Quran in the Atlantic Ocean\u201d. The herders\u2019 association, Miyetti Allah, is believed to be enjoying state protection. If you accept this theory, as millions of southerners and middle belters do, then you are likely to have serious sentiments for the anti-Fulani movement. And you are likely to support the actions of Akeredolu and Igboho. You will see their endeavours as an attempt to protect Yorubaland from Fulani \u201cjihadists\u201d. I fear that this suspicion is fuelling the tension between Yoruba and Fulani communities in the south-west. Hence, the songs of war.<\/p> <p>Ironically, herders, mostly Fulani, are also heavily implicated in the insecurity ravaging the north-west. Most of the kidnappers in that region are said to be Fulani. There have been incessant kidnappings and killings in Zamfara state in the last seven years \u2014 that was before Buhari came to power. The crimes are usually attributed to bandits. Therefore, what we have in our hands is a failed security system that has led to insecurity nationwide. The narrative in the south is that the criminals are bandits when they strike up north but Fulani jihadists when they strike down south. That is the price we pay for the inability of the country to protect us. It creates room for all sorts.<\/p> <p>I would also say that the federal government is not acting in a way that will make southerners trust the state. Take, for instance, the order to arrest Igboho \u2014 which I support. No individual, not even a governor or a president, has the power to evict any Nigerian from any part of the country based on ethnicity, politics or religion. But where this administration always loses the case is that it is not even-handed. In 2017, a group of northern youths led by Alhaji Shettima Yerima issued an ultimatum to Igbo people to leave the north by October 1 because of Biafra agitations. Nobody ordered his arrest, and we had a police force and an IGP to boot. That is how trust is lost.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, I would like to warn against ethnic profiling when it comes to criminal matters. It is a dangerous game. To the best of my knowledge, every ethnic group in Nigeria has criminals. For all you care, the Fulani guys that are implicated in kidnapping and ransom-taking might be working in conjunction with Yoruba insiders and police accomplices. They will be sharing the proceeds of crime without discrimination. That these people are getting away with these crimes \u2014 without any arrests or prosecutions even when the states have the power to do so \u2014 suggests that it is an organised network. They appear, to me, to be enjoying protection from security agencies.<\/p> <p>The challenge facing us is two-fold: de-escalating the tension and improving security. While the first is urgent and immediate, the second is medium-term; without it, there will always be such flare-ups. Insecurity by itself is bad enough. When we now allow it to be layered with ethnic tensions, it is doubly dangerous. The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) has a role to play in calming nerves. Most importantly, Buhari needs to be actively involved. He should call the governors to a meeting and, if necessary, summon an emergency meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) to discuss the burning issues. We are, as it seems to me, playing with fire. We should not take our luck for granted.<\/p> <p>In the final analysis, moments like this call for statesmanship, not war mongering. This is not the time to be beating drums of war. This is the time to \u201ckulu temper\u201d and confront the issues one by one: why are these crimes so easy to commit? Why is nobody facing prosecution? What can we do to protect the lives of all \u2014 no matter the ethnic or religious affiliation? We have enormous security problems to overcome if we are to enjoy peace. One of my favourite Yoruba proverbs says: \u201cIrorun igi ni irorun eye.\u201d You see, it is in the interest of the bird that the tree is comfortable for her to perch on. If we don\u2019t silence the drumbeat of war, we may live to regret it. My two cents.<\/p> <p>AND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026<\/p> <p>FORBES LIST<\/p> <p>Forbes has released its Africa\u2019s Billionaires list for 2020 but it would appear the enthusiasm is not what it used to be. I have always questioned the metrics: the magazine uses the value of quoted companies to determine its ranking \u2014 and we all know this is not a reliable yardstick in our clime. No wonder, Dr Mike Adenuga Jnr, the billionaire entrepreneur with vast interests in telecoms and oil, reportedly has no regard for the ranking, even though his name is on the list. Most of his businesses are not quoted so his worth is understated. A scoring system that only looks at assets and ignores liabilities is not something that can be considered reliable or authoritative. Reform.<\/p> <p>CLEAN BILL?<\/p> <p>So Bill Gates has now taken the COVID-19 vaccine? I am getting confused. The vaccine, according to the conspiracy theory, is meant to alter our DNA, plant microchips in our bodies and allow the same Bill Gates to take control of our brains so that we can become his zombies. Now that he has taken the vaccine, does that mean Bill Gates will now take control of the brain of Bill Gates? Never mind. The new theory will be that it was water that was injected into his body, not vaccine. So far, over 20 million shots of the vaccines have been administered on Americans. Israel has incredibly vaccinated about 25 percent of its population. It appears those ones did not get the memo. Bewildering.<\/p> <p>HARD HADIZA<\/p> <p>I was very glad that President Muhammadu Buhari has re-appointed Ms Hadiza Bala Usman as the managing director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). Why? Ferocious media attacks that have been launched against her. She really stepped on toes \u2014 toes of those who have been holding the country to ransom with fraudulent agreements designed to rape the national treasury and turn the commonwealth to their private pockets. Those I am talking about know themselves. If Buhari had succumbed to the blackmail, that would have sent the wrong message to the ports community. The biggest task ahead of her now is how to overcome the demons of port congestion. Challenge.<\/p> <p>BIDEN ON BOARD<\/p> <p>I was so relieved to see the back of Donald Trump on Wednesday as the United States inaugurated Joe Biden as its new president. Trump was a nightmare and an embarrassment to his country. I don\u2019t even know if Biden would be a better president on the economic front, but I know for sure that he would not be a rabble rouser or demagogue like Trump. I\u2019m not sure anybody missed Trump at the inaugurated which he petulantly \u2014 but predictably \u2014 boycotted after setting the country on fire with his baseless claims of rigging. We Nigerians look up to America a lot in our practice of democracy. Every wrong move can empower the anti-democratic elements in Nigeria.

Dissident journalists, including Blumenthal, stationed themselves in the embassy in opposition to the illegal eviction and to document the behavior of the evictors. Blumenthal calls the assault charge \u201ca 100 percent false, fabricated, bogus, untrue, and malicious lie.\u201d<\/p> <p>I watched the news of the embassy standoff with much interest, largely because the obnoxious, oafish behavior of the anti-Maduro counter-protesters on the scene were a perfect reflection of the obnoxious, oafish behavior I\u2019d experienced from anti-Maduro accounts online. I\u2019ve argued with every major political faction in America at one point or another, and some of them can be downright vile, but I\u2019ve never run into such an intellectually dishonest, crude, nasty group of people in my three years on this job as those who\u2019ve been cheering on the Trump administration\u2019s regime change agenda in Venezuela.

Mainstream media reporters have been completely ignoring this story.<\/p> <p>\u201cArrest and caging of opposition US journalist Max Blumenthal reminds me (and others I know) of the worst of Russia,\u201d tweeted journalist Mark Ames. \u201cExcept there, when oppo journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested, most big-name Russian journalists\u2014including Putin-friendly\u2014publicly supported Golunov. Here\u2014silence.\u201d<\/p> <p>This silence is unsurprising at this point, because this same media class has for years been either mute or vocally favorable on the persecution of another dissident journalist, Julian Assange. Ambitious young journalists are made well aware that the very easiest way to demonstrate your loyalty to the media-owning plutocratic establishment is to participate in the relentless smear campaign against the WikiLeaks founder which has worked its way into virtually all political sectors of the western world, and the very easiest way to lose standing within the plutocratic media is to defend him.<\/p> <p>There\u2019s a popular quote that a German pastor wrote after the second World War that goes,<\/p> <p>\u201cFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was not a socialist.<\/p> <p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was not a trade unionist.<\/p> <p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was not a Jew.<\/p> <p>Then they came for me\u2014<\/p> <p>and there was no one left to speak for me.\u201d<\/p> <p>It\u2019s a good quote, and, understandably, people have been invoking it for the steadily escalating war on oppositional journalism we\u2019ve been witnessing throughout the western empire. Cries of \u201cFirst they came for Assange\u201d and \u201cFirst they came for the journalists\u201d are common in circles which value the existence of a free press which is capable of holding power to account, the argument being that if you let them come for journalists like Assange and Blumenthal, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they come for you, too.<\/p> <p>Only one problem: it isn\u2019t true.<\/p> <p>Arrest & caging of opposition US journalist @MaxBlumenthal reminds me (and others I know) of the worst of Russia.

That\u2019s only true if you intend at some point to publish something that those in power don\u2019t want you to publish. If you\u2019ve closed the door to the possibility of your ever doing that, then you know that there is no risk to you, so there\u2019s no need to defend dissident journalists when their reporting sees them targeted for legal persecution by the powerful. Which is exactly what mainstream reporters who fail to defend Assange and Blumenthal are telling us about themselves: they\u2019ve closed that door and chosen the side of power, come what may.<\/p> <p>This is where the silence comes from. It isn\u2019t that those who work in mainstream news media lack an understanding that at some point power structures may shift and you\u2019ll want to report facts that are inconvenient for the powerful without fear of imprisonment; these people all watched Donald Trump get elected. They already know that things can take a very dark turn in the future for where power is located, and they\u2019ve already decided they don\u2019t care and will always side with the powerful going forward. If the election of Donald Trump wasn\u2019t enough to show these people that it\u2019s a good idea to make sure the press can continue to hold power to account in the future, then nothing will. They\u2019re not ignorant, they\u2019re subservient. They\u2019ve made a lifelong commitment to continue to worship at the altar of power.<\/p> <p>If we were to re-write the \u201cFirst they came\u201d poem to describe the current war on dissident journalism we\u2019re seeing in 2019, it would go more like this:<\/p> <p>First they came for Assange, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was a mainstream western journalist with no intention of ever usetting the powerful.<\/p> <p>Then they came for Blumental, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I was a mainstream western journalist with no intention of ever usetting the powerful.<\/p> <p>Then they came for all the other dissident journalists, and I did not speak out\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I will never be a dissident journalist.<\/p> <p>They never came for me\u2014<\/p> <p>Because I have chosen to serve power.<\/p> <p>______________________________<\/p> <p>Thanks for reading!

In protest, he attempted to slit his wrists in front of an investigator and a lawyer. When prevented from doing so, Losik announced that he was restarting his hunger strike. This time, he said, he would refuse all liquids as well as food. Already weakened by a previous hunger strike and an extended period in prison, fears are now mounting that Losik may not survive much longer.<\/p> <p>Losik launched his initial hunger strike on December 15 in response to the charges filed against him for \u201cplotting riots\u201d in connection with the protest movement that has swept Belarus since the country\u2019s deeply flawed August 2020 presidential election. It is not clear how Losik could have participated in the plotting of riots, however, as he has been detained since June 2020. He faces the prospect of an eight-year prison term if convicted. The charges against him have been widely condemned as politically motivated.<\/p> <p>Between December and January, the jailed blogger refused all food for 42 days. He only called off his hunger strike due to what he described as \u201can unbelievable wave of solidarity,\u201d and the fact that two students and an Orthodox priest also began hunger strikes in support of his cause. \u201cI know that many also went on hunger strikes. I cannot take on such a great burden of responsibility, I do not want others to suffer due to my conscious choice,\u201d Losik said in a statement via his lawyer on January 25 when announcing an end to his initial hunger strike.<\/p> <p>During his term in prison, Losik has been repeatedly transferred from one cell to another while also being deprived of the right to receive letters and other information. His wife Daria accuses the Belarusian authorities of creating \u201ctorture chamber\u201d conditions. She says Losik is being held in a cold cell with no sunlight or fresh air and rudimentary toilet facilities.<\/p> <p>Supporters claim the case against Losik is full of lies and examples of misconduct. When members of the Belarusian security service first rang the doorbell of his apartment on June 25, 2020, they allegedly threatened to blow the door open if Losik did not allow them in. The officers then ordered Losik, who also works as a consultant for RFE\/RL on new media technologies, to accompany them to the police department. They needed him to \u201csign a paper,\u201d they explained. After that, \u201che would be released,\u201d they allegedly promised. \u201cTake some cash to buy a bus ticket to get home. You will be back soon,\u201d they added.<\/p> <p>Losik never came home. He has been in custody ever since. The 28-year-old husband and father of a two-year-old daughter has been held in pre-trial detention in Zhodzina for more than 260 days. He was initially charged with \u201cpreparing to disrupt public order.\u201d Further charges continue to be added.<\/p> <p>Subscribe for the latest from BelarusAlert Receive updates for events, news, and publications on Belarus from the Atlantic Council. Email *<\/p> <p>Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.<\/p> <p>The mounting charges against Losik reflect the Lukashenka regime\u2019s hardline approach to anti-government protests. On the same day the blogger was taken into custody, then-Belarusian Interior Minister Yuri Karaev claimed in an address to the Belarusian Parliament\u2019s lower chamber that recent protests were organized and coordinated through YouTube livestreams and Telegram channels. He also mentioned RFE\/RL\u2019s coverage of a June 18 demonstration in Minsk as an example. Over the next 24 hours, three popular Belarusian YouTubers (Uladzimir Niaronski, Uladzimir Tsyhanovich, and Siarhei Piatrukhin), all faced the same charges as Losik. A fully-fledged witch hunt against independent Belarusian bloggers had begun.<\/p> <p>Losik had been on the radar of Belarusian law enforcement since at least 2011, when the so-called \u201cRevolution Through Social Networks\u201d took place in Minsk and other regional cities across Belarus. This was essentially a series of peaceful flash mobs that saw people meet at the same time and place each week to clap. Their relatively innocuous form of protest continued throughout June and July 2011, and made dictator Alyaksandr Lukashenka angry enough to issue a decree banning hand-clapping in public. Meanwhile, Lukashenka\u2019s security forces cracked down on the protests. Participants were beaten, dispersed, or arrested.<\/p> <p>The protesters, mostly in their 20s, communicated through internet platform Vkontakte, the Russian-language answer to Facebook. Losik was one of the administrators of the online community behind the 2011 protests. The Belarusian KGB identified him as a leading figure in the protest movement and forced Losik to stop promoting the clapping campaign.<\/p> <p>Despite this setback, Losik remained active online. In subsequent years, his Twitter account and Telegram channel became among the most popular in Belarus. He wrote about Belarusian politics along with events in Russia and Ukraine, focusing on protest movements and propaganda. Losik never courted publicity or popularity. Instead, having completed a fellowship at RFE\/RL in Prague and Washington DC, he returned to the provincial Belarusian town of Baranavichy, where he lived with his wife and newborn child until he was arrested.<\/p> <p>Despite Losik\u2019s unremarkable surroundings, his online activities made him an obvious target for the authorities. During the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Belarus, Losik undermined official denials by reporting details of the dire situation in many hospitals. Medical workers anonymously told him that there was no protective equipment and leaked information that the death rate was higher than the official statistics. Beginning in May 2020, he closely followed mounting anti-regime protests on his popular Telegram channel.<\/p> <p>Given his relatively high profile and record of online activism, Losik\u2019s arrest was not entirely surprising. At first, the tone of his letters from prison was optimistic and hopeful. However, the blogger\u2019s state of mind began to deteriorate after the controversial August 9 Belarusian presidential election. His wife explains that he had no prior experience of prison conditions or being kept in isolation from his family.<\/p> <p>In February 2021, when a Belarusian court handed a two-year jail sentence to Belsat journalists Katsiaryna Andreeva and Daria Chultsova, Losik\u2019s mood worsened. \u201cI have no illusions. I think it will be about five more years, and by that time I will have died. I no longer have any desire to do anything,\u201d he wrote in a handwritten letter published online. \u201cSo much has already been done, and all for naught. Nothing influences anybody. I\u2019ll say it honestly: I doubt anything will change.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Belarusian authorities continue to extend Losik\u2019s pretrial detention. His case appears to be frozen. The extension of custody time limits is a common tactic used by the Lukashenka regime. It allows the authorities to keep a detainee in jail for as long as required without sending their case to court.<\/p> <p>The jailed blogger, who desperately wants to see his wife and daughter, ended his last letter with these words: \u201cIt would have been better to just shoot me quickly so I didn\u2019t have to see it all.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Co-chairs of the Human Rights Commission of the US House of Representatives have urged the government of Belarus to immediately release Losik, as has RFE\/RL President Jamie Fly.<\/p> <p>More needs to be done urgently in order to avert tragedy. Losik\u2019s recent vow to escalate his hunger strike places his life in direct danger. There may not be much time left to secure justice for this talented young blogger and political prisoner before it is too late.<\/p> <p>Hanna Liubakova is a journalist from Belarus and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council.

I remarked that, since my unprecedented filing of a regulatory complaint against Chinese state television in London last November, China had not paraded another foreigner on TV in this manner.<\/p> <p>In the moment my article was published in The Diplomat magazine, I was proven wrong. They did it again. They aired a crude video clip of Simon Cheng, former UK Consulate worker in Hong Kong, falsely and forcibly \u201cconfessing\u201d to some peculiar alleged crimes. Cheng vanished during a business trip to Shenzhen across the border in August. He was detained incognito and released a fortnight or so later after a diplomatic contest with London.<\/p> <p>Photo: People\u2019s Daily screenshot.<\/p> <p>This broadcast was carried by CGTN, the international offshoot of China Central Television (CCTV), a propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party. It was CCTV and CGTN that I filed a complaint against a year ago over their broadcasts of me locked in a cage forcibly and falsely \u201cconfessing\u201d to crimes I had not committed, in 2013 and 2014.<\/p> <p>The British broadcast regulator Ofcom is still investigating my complaint along with a subsequent complaint filed by Angela Gui, the daughter of publisher Gui Minhai. On Ofcom\u2019s own initiative, it is also investigating CGTN\u2019s broadcasting of fake news about Hong Kong.<\/p> <p>The UK\u2019s broadcasting law, policed by Ofcom, has crystal-clear, black and white provisions on issues of privacy, fairness, factuality and standards of content that must be upheld by all TV outfits licenced by this regulator to broadcast in the UK. CCTV and CGTN hold licences to broadcast on two channels to UK airwaves, and the Simon Cheng fake confession was aired on one of those, China24, while a companion clip was broadcast on CGTN\u2019s YouTube channel.<\/p> <p>Not only did CGTN yet again violate the UK broadcasting code, and equivalent broadcasting laws in other countries, it also violated Chinese law and the Chinese constitution, which, believe it or not, guarantees fair and transparent trials.<\/p> <p>CGTN on social media. Photo: Twitter.<\/p> <p>The Simon Cheng broadcast was intended to counter a slew of articles in the international media revealing that he was tortured, as he was forced to sign false confessions related to soliciting prostitutes. The combating of accurate and factual news in international media about why I had been detained, as well as to falsely incriminate me, was also the reason for my own false TV confession in 2013.<\/p> <p>Apart from being illegal, the Cheng broadcast was also revealing in ways that his Chinese police captors and tormentors may not have realised \u2013 or cared about \u2013 at the time.<\/p> <p>Cheng\u2019s brutal treatment tells us much about the Chinese dictatorship\u2019s approach to justice. His mistreatment, globally decried as a human rights abuse, and his false charge, absolutely typify the Chinese police methodology \u2013 both by the Public Security Bureau (the police) and the Ministry of State Security. It is fully representative of their coercive and abusive legal system. To me, Cheng\u2019s story which he told to media a few days before the CGTN broadcast, is totally credible because \u201cI have been there\u201d.<\/p> <p>The abuse described by Cheng is the pervasive norm of Chinese police behaviour. They know no other way. The Public Security Bureaus and the Ministry of State Security rely exclusively on forcing confessions and statements from detainees and from so-called witnesses to obtain a conviction at any cost. They do not rely on any forensic or real police investigative skills; they rely on menace, duress and torture.<\/p> <p>The entire legal system in China is one of coercive force, not of judicial process.<\/p> <p>An artists\u2019 impression of how Peter Humphrey\u2019s televised confession was set up. Artwork: Alexey Garmash.<\/p> <p>When I was a prisoner, I was interrogated every day by multiple interrogators. During interrogation, I was always locked inside a steel cage, locked into a metal chair, in handcuffs, with no legal counsel present. My thumb was then pressed into red seal ink, forcing me to thumbprint statements that bore little relation to what I had said.<\/p> <p>While in detention, the authorities do everything to crush the human spirit in order to extort a confession, in order to justify a detention that has nothing to do with whatever charge they publicly announce.<\/p> <p>They hold the prisoner in sordid conditions, without civilised hygiene facilities, without heating or air-conditioning, without hot water, without proper nutrition, in crowded unfurnished cells, freezing in winter, like an oven in summer, withholding medical treatment, blocking access to lawyers when it is most needed, barring contact with family, no phone calls, no correspondence, lights on 24\/7 preventing sleep, forced to squat for hours on end, with guards yelling at them all the time.<\/p> <p>Detainees in so-called pre-trial detention centres are subjected to what is effectively a punishment regime from day one and treated as guilty before any charges, indictment or trial, even though China\u2019s own \u201claws\u201d provide for presumption of innocence before proven guilty by a court, a gross fallacy.<\/p> <p>Peter Humphrey\u2019s two confessions on CCTV. Photo: Screenshot.<\/p> <p>With non-citizens, during interrogations, they also often try to get the prisoner to admit to false charges of espionage. They did this to me. Predictably, they did this to Simon Cheng.<\/p> <p>They tried to get him to admit falsely that the UK was funding and organizing the Hong Kong protest movement, code for undermining Chinese national security, a capital offence. With me, they tried to charge me with spying in Xinjiang, because of remarks in a country risk analysis report written by one of my colleagues for our clients. It was pathetic. I resisted and luckily destroyed these accusations very quickly. They have also done this to the two Canadians being held in Beijing for the past year, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.<\/p> <p>When the police grabbed Cheng at the frontier checkpoint turnstiles, they told him \u201cthis is orders from the top\u201d. It is not the norm for a person suspected of soliciting a prostitute to be arrested on \u201corders from the top\u201d, code for high-level Chinese leadership. From the very beginning, this slip of the tongue made it clear this was not about prostitution.<\/p> <p>The police inadvertently disclosed that the charge against Cheng of soliciting prostitution was utter nonsense. Everybody in China knows only the organising of prostitution is a real crime in China. Brothel keepers, pimps and human traffickers who are not protected by the PSB get stiff prison terms. But soliciting a prostitute in China is a minor offence that usually earns a smack on the hand, just a few weeks in detention, and usually does not go to court.<\/p> <p>The exception is when the detainee has been a special target of the regime all along, or the target of some kind of revenge action by somebody with friends in the police, and then the prostitution charge is just a pretext for victimisation.<\/p> <p>A collage of forced confessions. Photo: Handout.<\/p> <p>That was so when the critical American political blogger Charles Xue Manzi was paraded on Chinese television in 2013. And this is the case with Cheng. He was targeted as a means to attack the UK, a critic of the harsh anti-democracy crackdown in Hong Kong.<\/p> <p>In addition, the authorities as reported by CGTN have admitted they had him under surveillance for days. The PSB never expend such resources on somebody who is just suspected of visiting prostitutes. They would only go to this effort if the person was a target for some other reason.<\/p> <p>In this case, he was surveilled because they wanted a pretext to arrest and rough up someone working for the British. In other words, he was a scapegoat and instrument in an attack on the UK. He was singled out because of his employment at the Consulate. His detention was classic Chinese diplomatic-hostage taking aimed at punishing Hong Kong\u2019s former master.<\/p> <p>The CGTN footage from surveillance video showed Cheng transacting at a reception desk and following a woman down a corridor and into a room. If this was indeed a brothel, it begs the question how and why it exists after President Xi Jinping ordered a crackdown against prostitution after coming to power in late 2012. How on earth can such a brothel still exist if President Xi shut them all down and if prostitution is illegal?<\/p> <p>Photo: People\u2019s Daily screenshot.<\/p> <p>The answer is plain. Every Chinese knows that most brothels are either owned by or protected by police, and the crackdown left many or most of them untouched. Neither CGTN nor the authorities have explained why it was not the brothel that was subjected to \u201clegal action\u201d but one particular visitor among the thousands who use this house of ill repute every month.<\/p> <p>What China has done through this incident, aided and abetted by state television, is to prove for the world to see that there is no transparency, fairness or genuine due process in China.<\/p> <p>Former British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called on the UK government to issue a British passport to Simon Cheng because his life is now in danger.<\/p> <p>I would also urge Ofcom to investigate Cheng\u2019s subjection to forced and falsified televised confession aired by CGTN on UK airwaves.<\/p> <p>Peter Humphrey has been a China specialist for 44 years.

(AP Photo\/Vincent Yu)<\/p> <p>The city\u2019s police mobilized over 1,000 officers to carry out Wednesday\u2019s arrests, raiding 72 locations, including four media outlets. Those arrested are being charged with subversion under the national security law. Penalties for convictions range from a minimum of ten years behind bars to life in prison.<\/p> <p>Many of those detained are longstanding figures within Hong Kong political establishment, including Benny Tai, a key figure of the 2014 \u201cOccupy\u201d movement; and James To and Claudia Mo, of the Democratic Party and Hong Kong First respectively. Another of the detained former lawmakers, Lam Cheuk-ting, was previously arrested in August under accusations of rioting in 2019. In reality, Lam had been the victim of an attack by pro-Beijing gangsters. John Clancey, a human rights lawyer and US citizen, was also arrested.<\/p> <p>Joshua Wong, one of the most prominent youth activists in Hong Kong, was also charged under the national security law for the first time. Police had already jailed Wong on separate charges prior to this week\u2019s raids. In early December, he was sentenced to more than 13 months in prison for taking part in protests deemed unlawful in 2019.<\/p> <p>Among the targeted media was the tabloid Apple Daily, which is published by Next Digital Media and founded by Jimmy Lai. Lai has vocally criticized Beijing while posturing as a pro-democracy advocate. He has also been jailed under the national security law after being arrested in August. Lai has longstanding connections with the US intelligence agencies and state department. He has held meetings with figures like Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for security John Lee indicated that more arrests could be coming, saying investigations were ongoing. \u201cThe government will not tolerate subversion of state power. This is severe, and we will prosecute accordingly,\u201d He stated.<\/p> <p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying stated that the arrests were necessary to prevent \u201cexternal forces and individuals colluding to undermine China\u2019s stability and security.\u201d Since the beginning of the 2019 protests, Beijing has sought to blame foreign interference for the source of public anger, rather than to acknowledge declining living and working conditions and attacks on basic democratic rights that animate working-class discontent throughout China.<\/p> <p>The Beijing bureaucracy\u2019s greatest fear is that workers in Hong Kong will break out of the control of the pan-democrats and move to assert their own independent interests and spark the latent opposition within the huge working class on the Chinese mainland.<\/p> <p>The arrested include those who ran in an unofficial primary last year, organized to determine which opposition candidates would stand in the general election originally slated for September. More than 600,000 people participated, exceeding expectations.<\/p> <p>The Hong Kong government postponed the election in July citing the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext. Wednesday\u2019s arrests therefore make it clearer that the postponement was motivated by political considerations, with the city government and Beijing fearing a landslide victory for the pan-democrats.<\/p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s arrests follow the sentencing of 10 people accused of violating border laws while attempting to flee Hong Kong for Taiwan. They were arrested by the Chinese coast guard on August 23 in a boat outside of Hong Kong waters, according to Chinese authorities. They were given sentences ranging from seven months to three years in jail on the mainland.<\/p> <p>Two minors also arrested at the time were returned to Hong Kong in police custody. The government tried the group on December 28 in a closed, one-day trial. One of those arrested in August, Andy Li, is an activist who had also been charged with violating the national security law.<\/p> <p>Washington has responded to the latest arrests with its standard hypocritical rhetoric. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s nominee for secretary of state said on Twitter, \u201cThe sweeping arrests of pro-democracy demonstrators are an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights. The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing\u2019s crackdown on democracy.\u201d<\/p> <p>This is in contrast to Biden and the Democratic Party\u2019s response to the ongoing threat of a coup in Washington, led by President Trump. Prior to the violent assault by fascist rioters on the Capital on Wednesday, the Democrats did everything possible to downplay the threat to democratic rights and the Constitution. Washington has no genuine concern for democracy, but instead sees Hong Kong as another means to undermine China, in an attempt to force it to accept US hegemony.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s pan-democrats similarly have no real concern for the democratic rights of the city\u2019s workers and youth. They are a coalition of different parties, trade unions, and organizations, headed by the Democratic Party, that represent sections of the Hong Kong bourgeoisie. These layers desire closer economic ties with the US and other Western powers and resent Beijing\u2019s impact on their business interests. While some groupings within the pan-democrats attempt to appear radical or even socialist, they seek to pressure Beijing into making an accommodation.<\/p> <p>The pan-democrats are just as hostile to the working class as Beijing. In fact, their duplicity has helped paved the way for Beijing\u2019s crackdown. In 2019 when workers were beginning to join the protest movement, the pan-democrats responding by indicating that, on one hand, they would be willing to accept an agreement with the government, and on the other, utilizing anti-Chinese and pro-US slogans to obfuscate the real causes of the protests and push the movement to the right.<\/p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s official opposition demonstrated it would not launch any serious fight for democratic rights which would involve mobilizing the working class throughout China to directly challenge the Chinese Communist Party regime.

Cox-Berry briefly let go of the girl, and the employee was able to get the children who were also nearby into a classroom, according to a police affidavit. Police say there were 19 other children nearby at the time. Cox-Berry then approached the building and started punching a window in an apparent attempt to get inside, police said. The employee then produced a firearm and held off the man while calling 911.<\/p> <p>Critics of armed school staffers often claim that there\u2019s no way educators could have enough training to actually protect students, that the presence of lawfully-carried guns only increases the risks of others being accidentally injured, and trigger-happy teachers could turn their campus into a Wild West war zone. Of course they don\u2019t have any evidence for any of their arguments, because the reality is that none of the scary predictions from the opponents of armed school staffers have ever come to pass.<\/p> <p>In this case, the staffer acted completely rationally and professionally. They didn\u2019t even display their firearm until the potential kidnapping situation had escalated into violence. Far from the \u201cshoot first, ask questions later\u201d mentality that anti-gun activists claim is inherent among those of us who exercise our right to carry, this staffer demonstrated restraint and caution; shepherding the students under their care into a classroom while keeping an eye out on the stranger. Only when the suspect tried to gain entrance to the school did the staffer pull out their firearm, and even then, the trigger was never pulled.<\/p> <p>Lt. Brian Eynon with the Ogden Police Department praised the school employee after the suspect was taken into custody.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis employee is protected under the Second Amendment. He followed all policy and procedure at the school, and in this particular case, did everything that he should have done to protect the innocent lives of the children at the school,\u201d says the Lieutenant. \u201cAnd in this case, it is likely that a life was saved or injury to a life was prevented due to the actions of this heroic employee.\u201d<\/p> <p>School officials were quick to hail the quick thinking of the staffer as well.<\/p> <p>\u201cA teacher intervened when there was a situation that threatened students safety. This teacher, this school employee, is a hero. We don\u2019t disagree with that at all,\u201d Ogden School District\u2019s Jer Bates tells us. \u201cYes, it was a very scary situation, something we take very seriously, but it came out with a good ending, meaning no students were physically harmed, no adults were physically harmed, that this was an incident where out emergency response protocols were acted out.\u201d<\/p> <p>While police and the school district are praising the teacher, don\u2019t expect the Utah chapter of Moms Demand Action to do the same. The anti-gun group hates the idea of allowing trained school staff to carry in defense of students and employees, claiming that laws like the one in Utah places \u201cchildren at risk of unintentional shootings and escalating conflict without decreasing the risk of an active shooter.\u201d<\/p> <p>I\u2019m not aware of a single unintentional shooting from a legally armed school staffer anywhere in the coutnry, but we\u2019ve got proof that armed school employees can and have protected the lives of the students in their care. Kudos to the Ogden teacher for thwarting this kidnapping, even if gun control activists like Shannon Watts would like to pretend it never happened.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3G3AJKPCXN7AR71T9PLWPM9CDCH4YR"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":266,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021.0","month":"May","date":"25.0","city":"Ogden","region":"None","country":"Utah","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"attempted kidnapping, unnamed 11-year old girl, schoolground, playground, Ogden","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2021.0","month":"May","date":"25.0","city":"Ogden","region":"None","country":"Utah","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"attempted kidnapping, unnamed 11-year old girl, schoolground, playground, Ogden","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":958987156,"Input.title":"Jailed Saudi activist in terrorism court on 'spurious' charges: UN experts","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-10 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Riyadh (AFP) \u2013<\/p> <p>Advertising Read more<\/p> <p>Jailed Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul appeared before a terrorism court on Thursday, her family said, as she faces the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence on what UN experts called \"spurious\" charges.<\/p> <p>Hathloul's hearing comes two days after a prominent American-Saudi doctor, Walid Fitaihi, was sentenced to six years in prison, highlighting what campaigners call growing state repression, despite international pressure over the kingdom's human rights record.<\/p> <p>Hathloul, 31, was arrested in May 2018 with about a dozen other women activists just weeks before the historic lifting of a decades-long ban on female drivers, a reform they had long campaigned for.<\/p> <p>After being tried in Riyadh's criminal court, her trial was transferred last month to the Specialised Criminal Court (SCC), or the anti-terrorism court, which campaigners say is notorious for issuing long jail terms and is used to silence critical voices under the cover of fighting terrorism.<\/p> <p>\"Loujain's spirits are high, but her body is still weak,\" her sister Alia al-Hathloul said after a hearing in the SCC.<\/p> <p>Hathloul's siblings are based outside the kingdom, but some of her other family members are allowed to attend court hearings, which are off-limits to journalists and diplomats.<\/p> <p>\"We are extremely alarmed to hear that Al-Hathloul, who has been in detention for more than two years on spurious charges, is now being tried by a specialised terrorism court,\" said Elizabeth Broderick, chair of the United Nations working group on discrimination against women and girls.<\/p> <p>\"We call once again on Saudi Arabia to immediately release Al-Hathloul, a woman human rights defender who has greatly contributed to advancing women's rights,\" she added in a statement.<\/p> <p>Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told AFP last week that Hathloul is accused of contacting \"unfriendly\" states and providing classified information, but her family said no evidence to support the allegations had been put forward.<\/p> <p>While some detained women activists have been provisionally released, Hathloul and others remain imprisoned on what rights groups describe as opaque charges.<\/p> <p>The pro-government Saudi media has branded them as \"traitors\" and Hathloul's family alleges she experienced sexual harassment and torture in detention.

It was that anti-Marcos spirit. I think I saw a glimpse of it in the video clips circulating from the past weekend. They showed about 300 people marching this past Saturday in Washington, D.C., thousands of miles away from where their hearts really were, the Philippines.<\/p> <p>The participants, mostly dual-citizens, PH and U.S., are the embodiment of the devolving relationship, sometimes colonial, sometimes free, uniquely Filipino. And now they were all marching not just to protest but to drop off their presidential election ballots to the Philippine Embassy in the U.S.<\/p> <p>If you\u2019re an overseas dual citizen, the election is May 9th. Don\u2019t forget to mail your ballots in on time. If you haven\u2019t received your ballot yet, call the Philippine Embassy.<\/p> <p>There are 190,000 eligible voters in the U.S., a relative fraction of the nearly 1.7 million overseas workers overall. Don\u2019t think your voice doesn\u2019t matter. Remittances talk, and the Philippines knows remittances. OFWs send back more than $30 billion last year. From the U.S. alone the amount is estimated at $13.2 billion.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s a \u201cB\u201d for Billion. Not Bong-Bong.<\/p> <p>If you send remittance money, you are an enabler of your family, sure, but also the Philippines. You might as well enable someone worthy of the presidency with your vote.<\/p> <p>Most all of the marchers in D.C. were dressed in pink of some sort, the campaign colors of Vice President Leni Robredo, trying to rally those who still believe that Filipinos are deserving of democracy.<\/p> <p>It made me wonder. Is that good old anti-Marcos feeling still alive? Can it make a comeback after all these years?<\/p> <p>It will take that kind of emotion felt in the 1980s to stave off the second coming of a Marcos presidency in the Philippines.<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>Back then Bong-Bong was just a kid in his 20s. Old enough to see the kind of reaction his family engendered. The anti-Marcos feeling was so strong during martial law you could feel it in the U.S. and easily get a thousand people to protest at San Francisco\u2019s Union Square. I was at one such protest as a reporter when Marcoses came to visit. There were Filipinos of all kinds, but also whites, unionists, other social justice fighters. They all knew what was at stake in the Philippines.<\/p> <p>With Reagan and Bush propping up a thieving dictatorship, people throughout the U.S. were impacted by the Marcos years as well. And they all knew Marcos was a bad man.<\/p> <p>In 2022, that\u2019s all a distant memory.<\/p> <p>Either you\u2019re too young. Or you\u2019re too old. Or too Filipino, willing to forget, or to just \u201cnot remember.\u201d You don\u2019t need trolls or social media to give you disinformation. You\u2019ve got that Filipino amnesia working for you, brought on by a reluctance to face some tough hard facts about the Marcos dictatorship.<\/p> <p>But this rehabilitation of the Marcos family has been going on since 2016, when President Rodrigo Duterte won the Supreme Court\u2019s blessing to go ahead with giving Daddy Dictator a hero\u2019s burial in the national cemetery.<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just being legalistic about it,\u201d said Duterte to the media about Marcos at the time. \u201cHe was president, he was a soldier. That\u2019s about it.\u201d<\/p> <p>Oh yeah, there are a few other choice words and adjectives Duterte could have used.<\/p> <p>Corrupt dictator, philanderer, plunderer, I could go on.<\/p> <p>The exiting Duterte has been spectacularly modest about his own political achievements, downplaying the thousands of extrajudicial killings attributed to his government.<\/p> <p>Duterte is no small-time guy. He\u2019s got stats.<\/p> <p>The UN Human Rights Council in 2020 said since Duterte was elected to the presidency, more than 27,000 suspected drug peddlers have been killed in a mix of police operations and vigilante killings. There have also been nearly 250 human rights defenders (unionists, lawyers, journalists and environmental rights defenders) killed.<\/p> <p>Compare that with the depth of Marcos\u2019 record. Amnesty International says Marcos imprisoned 70,000 people during martial law, tortured 34,000, and killed 3,240 Filipinos.<\/p> <p>Is this perhaps is the reason surveys show VP Leni Robredo has little chance to win?<\/p> <p>How many people has she killed? Jailed? Tortured?<\/p> <p>And then there\u2019s the money the Marcoses plundered from the Philippines, an amount exceeding $10 billion.<\/p> <p>No one comes close to the Marcoses. Even with billions partially recovered already, there is still $2.4 billion that remains in litigation, according to reports.<\/p> <p>Will the government have the political courage to go after a villainous Marcos family reinstalled as leaders?<\/p> <p>Is it even wrong to see Bong-Bong and the Marcoses synonymously? Of course not. It\u2019s the Philippines, after all.<\/p> <p>Junior is not separate from the father. The legacy is there. Just because Duterte buried Daddy Marcos doesn\u2019t absolve the heirs. Someone needs to be held accountable for all they did. They didn\u2019t flee in 1986 to Hawaii for vacation.<\/p> <p>But that makes the burial of Marcos in 2016 both literal and symbolic.<\/p> <p>The body and its deeds, along with the accompanying cleansing of history. Almost makes the social media trolling and disinformation unnecessary. One political friend of mine called it \u201cbrainwashing.\u201d<\/p> <p>And then when considering the Filipino nature is it even necessary. The Filipino nature?<\/p> <p>As one Filipino observer told me it\u2019s the tendency of Filipinos to avoid difficult subjects, and simply to make nice.<\/p> <p>It sets up an election where the smiling son of a dictator can stroll in, not debate any opponents, and run on the family\u2019s infamous name.<\/p> <p>Already some are talking how the return of the Marcoses will mean they\u2019ll spend some of that ill-gotten wealth back in the Philippines. But does that excuse decades of political sins?<\/p> <p>Another Filipino friend of mine feels there\u2019s momentum for Robredo and senses a surge, a \u201ctsunami\u201d in the final weeks.<\/p> <p>He believes that.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ll believe it if I sense some of that anti-Marcos fervor I saw and felt in the \u201880s.<\/p> <p>That was the power that toppled Marcos AND his family.

The crackdown appears connected to an event, \u201cIngabire Day,\u201d organized by the unregistered opposition party Dalfa-Umurinzi, that had been scheduled for October 14, 2021, to discuss among other things political repression in Rwanda.<\/p> <p>Th\u00e9oneste Nsengimana, a journalist who had intended to cover the event and host a discussion on his YouTube channel with Victoire Ingabire, the party\u2019s leader, was arrested on October 13.<\/p> <p>Several party members and regional representatives \u2013 Sylvain Sibomana, Alexis Rucubanganya, Hamad Hagengimana, and Jean-Claude Ndayishimiye \u2013 were also arrested at their homes on October 13, as was Joyeuse Uwatuje, Ingabire\u2019s close friend and personal assistant.<\/p> <p>According to sources within the Dalfa-Umurinzi party, Alphonse Mutabazi was arrested on the morning of October 14, and Marcel Nahimana, the party\u2019s secretary-general, and Emmanuel Masengesho were arrested the evening of October 14. R\u00e9gine Kadoyimana, an administrative assistant in the party, was arrested on October 16 at her home in the capital, Kigali.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Rwandan government\u2019s latest crackdown underscores that it is unwilling to tolerate debate and criticism,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThese blatantly arbitrary and politically motivated arrests are intended to further discourage people from speaking out against government policy or abuse.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) announced in a tweet late on October 13 that Nsengimana and five other unnamed people had been placed under arrest for \u201cpublication of rumours intended to cause uprising or unrest among the population.\u201d It also tweeted a warning against those who use social media to \u201cundermine national security\u201d and \u201cincite divisions.\u201d The agency has not made any public announcements about the four other arrests.<\/p> <p>According to sources within the Dalfa-Umurinzi party, the ten were arrested in different parts of the country, but all except Kadoyimana, the last one arrested, are now being held at Remera police station in Kigali. Kadoyimana is reportedly detained at Kicukiro police station, but Human Rights Watch was not able to independently confirm this. The RIB spokesperson did not respond to Human Rights Watch\u2019s requests for information. All have been given access to a lawyer. On October 18, a RIB agent called Ingabire to summon her to the investigation bureau\u2019s headquarters in Kigali, but at time of publication she had not yet been.<\/p> <p>Rwandan law includes overly broad and vague provisions that enable arbitrary limitations on free speech and that violate the right to freedom of expression and media freedom protections under international law. One of the laws being used to curb free speech is the Law on the Prevention of Cybercrimes, which prohibits the publication of \u201crumours,\u201d punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to three million Rwandan Francs (US$3,000).<\/p> <p>However, whether information is factual does not in itself constitute legitimate grounds to criminalize speech under international law. These charges are wholly inappropriate and underline how the justice system is being used as a tool to stifle dissent and intimidate the public, Human Rights Watch said. All ten people arrested should be immediately and unconditionally released.<\/p> <p>Ingabire, the former president of the unregistered opposition party FDU-Inkingi before creating Dalfa-Umurinzi in November 2019, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiracy to undermine the established government and denying the genocide after she tried to contest the 2010 presidential elections. She was eventually pardoned and released in September 2018.<\/p> <p>Sibomana, the FDU-Inkingi\u2019s then-secretary-general, was first arrested alongside another member of the party, Anselme Mutuyimana, in 2012 and accused of holding an illegal meeting in a bar. Mutuyimana was released in 2018 but found dead in mysterious circumstances in March 2019. Sibomana was released in 2021.<\/p> <p>Nsengimana was previously arrested in April 2020, alongside three other bloggers and a driver, all working with Rwandan YouTube channels that reported on the impact of the Covid-19 guidelines on vulnerable populations. Charges were brought against Nsengimana, Dieudonn\u00e9 Niyonsenga, known as \u201cCyuma Hassan,\u201d the owner of Ishema TV, and his driver, Fid\u00e8le Komezusenge.<\/p> <p>Nsengimana was held in pretrial detention on accusations of fraud but released in May 2020 for lack of evidence. Niyonsenga and Komezusenge were accused of forgery, impersonating journalists, and hindering public works but both were acquitted on March 12, 2021. The prosecution appealed the acquittal, and the hearing is expected in November.<\/p> <p>On October 14, the Rwanda Media Commission issued a statement claiming that Niyonsenga is not a journalist. Rwanda\u2019s narrow definition of journalists as \u201ca person who possesses basic journalism skills and who exercises journalism as his\/her first profession\u201d runs counter to international standards and has allowed the government to prosecute bloggers doing important public interest reporting, Human Rights Watch said.<\/p> <p>In March, Human Rights Watch documented the growing crackdown on people using YouTube to report on human rights abuses and current affairs and to hold political discussions. Between March 2020 and March 2021, at least eight people reporting or commenting on current affairs were threatened, arrested, prosecuted, or \u201cdisappeared\u201d in mysterious circumstances.<\/p> <p>Online commentators, such as Yvonne Idamange and Aimable Karasira, have also used their videos to discuss the 1994 genocide, the crimes committed by the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its aftermath, and the government\u2019s commemorations of the killings.<\/p> <p>Idamange, a Tutsi genocide survivor who accused the government of monetizing the genocide and called for a protest, was found guilty, in a trial held behind closed doors, of inciting violence and public uprising, denigrating genocide artifacts, spreading rumors, and violent assault, among other charges on September 30. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison. On May 31, Karasira was arrested on charges including denying and justifying the genocide and instigating divisions, and has not yet been tried.<\/p> <p>In recent years, several members of the FDU-Inkingi \u2013 now Dalfa-Umurinzi \u2013 have reported being detained incommunicado, beaten, and questioned about their membership to the party. In January 2020, six members were convicted of charges including forming or collaborating with irregular armed forces and offenses against the state. Those convicted included Boniface Twagirimana, the party\u2019s deputy leader, who \u201cdisappeared\u201d from his prison cell in Mpanga, southern Rwanda, in October 2018, and is still missing.<\/p> <p>Three others \u2013 Th\u00e9ophile Ntirutwa, Venant Abayisenga, and L\u00e9onille Gasengayire \u2013 were acquitted of all charges and released. After their release, they gave video interviews to local YouTube channels detailing their pretrial detention and describing ill-treatment and torture, including in Kwa Gacinya, an unofficial detention facility in the Gikondo neighborhood of Kigali, and in Mageragere and Nyanza prisons.<\/p> <p>Abayisenga was reported missing in June 2020 after he went out to buy phone credit, and is feared forcibly disappeared or dead. Ntirutwa was rearrested following an attack at his shop in Rwamagana District on May 11. On May 18, Ntirutwa and three others at his shop at the time of the attack were charged with offenses including murder, theft, and \u201cspreading false information with intent to create a hostile international opinion against the Rwandan State.\u201d Their trial has yet to begin.<\/p> <p>In 2019, three members of the FDU-Inkingi were reported missing or found dead in mysterious circumstances. In addition to Mutuyimana, in September, Syldio Dusabumuremyi, the party\u2019s national coordinator, was stabbed to death. And Eug\u00e8ne Ndereyimana, a party member, was reported missing on July 15, after he failed to arrive for a meeting in Nyagatare, Eastern Province. In March 2016, Illumin\u00e9e Iragena, a political activist and FDU-Inkingi member, was reported missing, most likely forcibly disappeared in unacknowledged government detention.<\/p> <p>\u201cRwanda\u2019s brutal methods to quash dissent give reason to be greatly concerned for the safety and well-being of anyone arrested,\u201d Mudge said. \u201cRwanda\u2019s international partners should publicly condemn the crackdown and Rwanda\u2019s abysmal human rights record, and press for the group\u2019s immediate and unconditional

So vicious and villainous were they that it is almost impossible to believe that any of them would care to read, let alone to write, novels or poetry, but all 10 of the notorious dictators on this list did just that.<\/p> <p>While the literary quality of some of their works has been acclaimed, some of their writings have been dismissed as \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d One dictator\u2019s novel was even carefully scrutinized by a U.S. government translator, U.S. officials, and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Whatever one makes of the efforts of these poets and novelists, it seems clear that the grimness of their rule as despised dictators will forever overshadow their literary works.<\/p> <p>Related: 10 Good Things Done By Evil Dictators<\/p> <p>10 Julius Caesar<\/p> <p>Julius Caesar\u2019s Commentaries on the Gallic War \u2013 Book 1<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Today, Julius Caesar (100 BC\u20134 BC) is generally regarded as a Roman emperor, mostly, perhaps, because it is forgotten that he himself claimed the title of dictator a year before he was assassinated. Politically savvy Caesar used his military triumphs as a general and his political alliances to advance his career, serving first as the governor of Spain\u2014at the time, a province of Rome\u2014and then as the governor of Gaul, the region of Europe that today includes France and Belgium. As the governor of Gaul, he enriched himself, using his wealth to support his army when he crossed the Rubicon River, initiating a civil war with the Roman general Pompey, whom Caesar defeated. Caesar\u2019s triumph was followed by his proclamation that he was now the dictator of Rome.<\/p> <p>Caesar was also a man of letters whose oratorical mastery led the famous teacher and rhetorician Quintilian to hold him in high regard. As The Conquest of Gaul points out, Caesar\u2019s \u201celegance of language\u201d put him nearly on par with Rome\u2019s greatest orator, Cicero. Caesar\u2019s Commentaries on the Gallic War and the Civil War, although non-fiction, are described as \u201cso elegantly and lucidly written that they compel\u2026admiration even without the addition of further ornament.\u201d<\/p> <p>Gifted both in public speaking and writing, Caesar brought his immense writing talent to bear on poetry as well, writing The Journey, allegedly while traveling to Spain. Unfortunately, only half a dozen lines of the poem\u2014a bit of literary criticism\u2014have survived, hexameters expressing Caesar\u2019s disappointment in the playwright Terence\u2019s \u201clack of \u2018comic force\u2019\u2026but [praising the dramatist]\u2026as a lover of \u2018pure speech.\u2019\u201d[1]<\/p> <p>9 Giuseppe Garibaldi<\/p> <p>Giuseppe Garibaldi: One of the Greatest Generals of Modern Times<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>The Warfare History Network\u2019s biographical sketch of Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882) captures the spirit of the man and the struggle he waged to reunite his beloved Italy: \u201cDetermined to end the divisions within his nation, [the] Italian soldier of fortune [who had become the dictator of Sicily]\u2026landed in Sicily in May 1860 at the head of 1,000 revolutionaries, the Redshirts. The unification of Italy had begun.\u201d<\/p> <p>After intense fighting and the losses of thousands of soldiers culminated in victory at the Battle of Volturno River in south-central Italy, King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, arriving with the main forces of the Piedmont Army, ordered Garibaldi and his troops to stand down. The king\u2019s men, not Garibaldi\u2019s, would capture the city of Capua. Garibaldi obeyed the king\u2019s decree, surrendered his dictatorial powers, and returned to Caprera, slighted and humiliated by the king, who arrived with his army just in time to end the war that Garibaldi and his loyal men had waged for months.<\/p> <p>As Jesse White Mario observes in his 1889 supplement to the autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the dictator wrote several novels, including Clelia, Il Volontario (The Volunteer), and I Mille (The Thousand), hoping to earn enough money from their sales to support himself and his family. But the books were \u201cfailures from a literary or even a historical point of view.\u201d Indeed, Garibaldi himself replied to critics of his efforts that he himself was aware as much as anyone else of how worthless they were.<\/p> <p>Citing the hostility of Garibaldi\u2019s critics, Lucy Riall, author of Garibaldi: Invention of a Hero, agrees that the dictator\u2019s novels were not especially successful, noting that only Clelia \u201cwas published widely in translation.\u201d He struggled to find an Italian publisher for I Mille; his fourth novel, Manlio, was not published until 1982, long after the author\u2019s death.[2]<\/p> <p>8 Ludwik Mieroslawski<\/p> <p>January uprising of 1863 an armed struggle that shaped several generations of Poles (4)<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>According to Ohio University, Ludwik Mieroslawski (1814\u20131878) was twice a failure. Described as a \u201cPolish general, revolutionary activist, commander of revolutionary movements, and political writer,\u201d he left Poland for France after participating in the November Uprising of 1830\u20131831. There, his attempt to organize a Young France failed. He next tried his hand at writing, publishing \u201cseveral poems, historical dramas, and a novel,\u201d but these literary efforts proved unsuccessful.<\/p> <p>Returning to both Poland and politics, he supported a revolution in his homeland but was arrested by Prussian authorities, tried, and sentenced to death. He was released, however, when the Berlin revolution began. An additional arrest and release occurred, as did more failures to win against his military adversaries. Mieroslawski finally became a dictator during the 1863 January Uprising in Poland. He left Europe to go abroad, reestablishing the Polish Democratic Society and serving as its president until his \u201cdictatorial\u201d ways and the scandals he evoked led to his removal from office. Also, he was later ousted from the organization altogether. He died in \u201cpoverty and isolation.\u201d<\/p> <p>George J. Lerski\u2019s Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945, is kinder in its assessment of Mieroslawski\u2019s literary work than his critics\u2019 appraisals. The dictator\u2019s 1822 debut collection of poems, Ballads and Romances, \u201cconstituted a literary breakthrough [opening] the era of Romanticism in Poland,\u201d Lerski says, adding that Mieroslawski\u2019s literary interests encompassed a variety of themes and genres. These included, among others, \u201cForefathers\u2019 Eve\u201d (Dziady), \u201ca drama in verse\u201d based on Lithuanian folklore; his mystical Books of the Polish Nation and of the Polish Pilgrims, which constitutes \u201ca moral interpretation of the Polish history written in biblical prose\u201d; and his supreme accomplishment, Master Thaddeus (Pan Tadeusz), a sentimental \u201cnovel in verse\u201d completed in mid-1834.[3]<\/p> <p>7 Emperor Meiji<\/p> <p>History Summarized: The Meiji Restoration<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Emperor Meiji (1814\u20131878) became the King of Japan at age sixteen. Through astute political, diplomatic, and cultural actions, he ushered in \u201cthe most glorious and prosperous period of Japan\u2019s history\u201d to date. A child prodigy when it came to poetry, he penned his first verse at age eight. Over his lifetime, he wrote between 90,000 and 100,000 thirty-one-syllable waka poems, which alternate lines of five and seven morae (short syllables) and contain a final line of seven morae known as the poem\u2019s tanka.<\/p> <p>The topics of the emperor\u2019s poems are often conveyed by their titles; many celebrate nature. \u201cPine\u201d reads, \u201cIn a world of storms\/ Let there be no wavering\/ Of our human hearts;\/ Remain as the pine tree\/ With root sunk deep in ston[e].\u201d \u201cUniversal Brotherhood\u201d ends with a question: \u201cIt is our hope\/ That all the world\u2019s oceans\/ Be joined in peace,\/ So why do the winds and waves\/ Now rise up in angry rage?\u201d[4]<\/p> <p>6 Joseph Stalin<\/p> <p>The Private Life of Joseph Stalin (full documentary)<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>The name of Joseph Stalin (1878\u20131953) is not one that many would associate with the writing of poetry. Still, the Russian dictator was a poet during his days as a student at the Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis, Georgia. For a time, he even aspired to become a professional poet. Then, as Robert Service recounts in Stalin: A Biography, after becoming \u201calienated from the authorities,\u201d he seemed to lose interest in poetry, as he had in his academic studies. He chose not to join the Georgian cultural elite, preferring, instead, to pursue \u201chis studies of socialism, politics, and economics.\u201d His participation in the Tbilisi literary scene in 1895-6 was fleeting, and he no longer contributed his works, despite his \u201cpleasing style.\u201d<\/p> <p>His interest in poetry is all the more surprising, considering how he treated a celebrated Russian poet after coming to power. Unable to stomach the abuses of Stalinist oppression, Osip Emilievich Mandelstam penned but did not publish \u201ca derogatory poem about Stalin in 1933.\u201d It quickly spread through \u201cword of mouth,\u201d writes Helen Rappaport in Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion. A couple of lines made it clear how the poet felt about the dictator: Stalin, \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s mountaineer,\u201d hammered out laws that were \u201cflung\/ Like horseshoes at the head, the eye, or the groin.\u201d<\/p> <p>When Stalin learned of the unflattering poem, he had Mandelstam arrested; soon, the poet was exiled for three years. He was fortunate, Rappaport suggests: Stalin had not ordered him executed, perhaps because the dictator suspected that having the poet shot might be seen as \u201can act of petulant retaliation for a mere poem.\u201d Although Mandelstam later wrote an ode in praise of Stalin, \u201cperhaps not so much to save himself as to protect his wife,\u201d it seems that the poet had not learned his lesson, as he was arrested again after his exile ended. He returned to Moscow, where he commenced his anti-Soviet activities again. This time, he was sentenced to \u201cone of the harshest camps of the Gulag,\u201d where, in poor mental and physical health, he died within two months of his arrival.[5]<\/p> <p>5 Benito Mussolini<\/p> <p>Mussolini \u2013 Father of Fascism Documentary<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>An ally of Adolph Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (1883\u20131945) is most remembered as Italy\u2019s feared and hated fascist leader during World War II. The stony-faced, square-jawed tyrant, whose features, in some official portraits, seem carved of concrete, looks cold and unfeeling. At the time of his death by firing squad, Mussolini was so detested, even by his fellow Italians, that, after his execution, his body was hung upside down on a hook, alongside that of his slain mistress Clara Petacci. While El Duce (The Leader) hung by his heels, his remains were spat upon as the dictator was cursed, and an armed woman stepped forward from the crowd, firing five bullets into Mussolini\u2019s corpse, announcing that her deed was an act of vengeance \u201cfor my five dead sons.\u201d The New York Times expressed the judgment shared by millions throughout the world: the dictator\u2019s death was \u201ca fitting end to a wretched life.\u201d<\/p> <p>It is surprising, if not incredible, that a man such as Mussolini wrote a novel, an act usually considered to require not only some literary talent but also a measure of humanity and sensitivity. Of course, his 1910 Claudia Particella, l\u2019amante del Cardinale (The Cardinal\u2019s Mistress), was a far cry from most fictional narratives. As Mussolini 1883\u20131915: Triumph and Transformation of a Revolutionary Socialist, edited by Spencer M. Di Scalia and Emilito Gentile, observes, the dictator\u2019s volume was, by its author\u2019s own admission, a nasty book that he judged to be \u201cfit for seamstresses and scandal.\u201d Serialized before its publication in book form, the novel tells the story of two lovers in a \u201cstory of violence and shameful acts.\u201d Described as written in the \u201cstyle of [Alexander] Dumas,\u201d it was a huge success, not only in Italy but also throughout much of the world, \u201cbeing translated into at least ten languages.\u201d<\/p> <p>Although Mussolini served as Italy\u2019s prime minister from 1922\u20131943 and would not become El Duce until 1943, it may have been that, when he wrote his novel, he had not yet fully developed into the hated monster he would become as his nation\u2019s dictator. Perhaps he yet retained at least a modicum of the humanity and sensitivity needed to write a tawdry novel that would beguile people by delivering scandal, despite the growing inhumanity and brutality of the fascist wartime dictator.[6]<\/p> <p>4 Francisco Franco<\/p> <p>Franco \u2013 Spain\u2019s Nationalist Dictator Documentary<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Jaime de Andrade\u2019s 1942 novel Raz (Spirit of a Race) glorified \u201cthe principles of the Franco regime,\u201d writes Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow in their La Historia del Espa\u00f1ol (The History of Spanish). At the same time, the book depicted its opponents as losers. Despite the heavy-handed censorship of literary works in Franco\u2019s Spain, the book encountered no obstacles to its publication and easily obtained funds for a film adaptation. However, this turn of events is not as surprising as it might seem: Jaime de Andrade was the pen name of brutal Spanish dictator Francisco Franco (1892\u20131975), the true author of Raz.<\/p> <p>As Paul Preston points out in The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, as of 2012, \u201cGeneral Franco and his regime [continued] to enjoy a relatively good press [due to]\u2026persistent myths about the benefits of his rule.\u201d In reality, the author declares, both as a general and as Spain\u2019s dictator, Franco was a cruel leader who, in his war diary of 1922, lovingly described \u201cMoroccan villages destroyed and defenders decapitated.\u201d Extreme violence was used repeatedly to suppress free thought, freedom of speech, and armed resistance before, during, and long after the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939).<\/p> <p>According to Preston, Franco\u2019s tactics included carrying bloody heads as trophies, fixing decapitated heads to bayonets, leaving a \u201cColumn of Death\u201d from Seville to Madrid, implementing mass murder, using kangaroo courts; and conducting \u201ccleansing and punishment operations.\u201d Although deaths were often unregistered, it is estimated that Franco\u2019s campaign of terror resulted in between 130,199 and 150,000 fatalities. This was the true state of affairs in Franco\u2019s Spain, a truth never mentioned in the dictator\u2019s novel.[7]<\/p> <p>3 Mao Zedong<\/p> <p>Mao Zedong in 10 MINUTES<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Chinese dictator Mao Zedong (1883\u20131976) did not write novels. He wrote poetry. In most of his poems, the verses feature images from the natural world or allusions to autobiographical and historical events, which are often military in nature. \u201cYellow Crane Tower\u201d (1927) exemplifies the general technique of Zedong\u2019s poems. According to Jeremy Ingalls\u2019s Dragon in Ambush: The Art of War in the Poems of Mao Zedong, Zedong\u2019s poem employs \u201cwordplay associated with the theme of imperial rule.\u201d<\/p> <p>The poem reads, \u201cThrough far and wide the nine streams branch across the Middle Kingdom,\/ Far deeper now one track that runs from south to north is threading.\/ But under gray-green murk of rain-damp grime,\/ Tortoise and Snake still trap the major stream.\/ The Yellow Crane perhaps still knows the route?\/ Here still survives a traveler\u2019s resting site.\/ The wine I seize to pledge the torrent\u2019s roaring,\/ In my heart\u2019s tide that mounts, its own waves soaring.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to Dragon in Ambush\u2019s interpretation of Zedong\u2019s poem, the nine streams created by the emperor Yu are contrasted with the even deeper track to the north that Zedong intends to cut as he and his army travel toward the Yangtze River, \u201cthe major stream\u201d that must be \u201ccrossed\u201d so that his forces can gain control of China.<\/p> <p>The question that the speaker of the poem (Zedong himself) asks about the Yellow Crane expresses his confidence that he will not only cross the river and conquer China but that he shall also enjoy immortality as a conquering godlike figure, thanks to \u201cthe leverage provided by the crane, the supernatural bird commemorated at the site of the Yellow Crane Tower.\u201d To many, this vision may seem odd. Still, it accords with Zedong\u2019s own world view that the successful \u201cdominant world-commander\u2026who [can]\u2026manipulate the\u2026processes of nature and human nature\u201d achieves an apotheosis of sorts, becoming \u201chimself the \u2018Heaven\u2019 to which all human beings\u2026are regarded as inevitable subjects.\u201d[8]<\/p> <p>2 Mohammad Raza Pahlavi<\/p> <p>Last Persian Shah \u2013 Full Movie<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>Mohammad Raza Pahlavi (1919-1980) was the Shah of Iran from 1941 to 1979, when the monarchy was abolished, and Ayatollah Khomeini (1900-1989) became the supreme leader for the next decade. As Abbas Milani points out in The Shah, his biography of Pahlavi, the future head of state was introduced to poetry by his constant companion, Ernest Perron, whom Pahlavi met as a student at Institut Le Rosey, a Swiss boarding school. Although Pahlavi never published any poetry, author Jon Ingvar Kjaran states that the young shah wrote some verses of his own while visiting with Perron, with whom Pahlavi also discussed poetry.<\/p> <p>As an article in The Guardian points out, despite Pahlavi\u2019s early fondness for poetry, the future Shah of Iran became a dictator who ran a brutally repressive regime, \u201cenforced by the notorious Savak secret police.\u201d His brutality and the corruption of his autocratic rule did not sit well with the Iranian people. When Pahlavi came into political conflict with his nation\u2019s prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq, and \u201cwas forced to flee the country,\u201d Pahlavi relocated several times, moving to Mexico, the United States, Panama, and Egypt, where he died in July 1980.[9]<\/p> <p>1 Saddam Hussein<\/p> <p>CIA Interrogator: At Time of U.S. Invasion, Saddam Hussein Was Focused on Writing Novel, Not WMDs<\/p> <p>Watch this video on YouTube<\/p> <p>As the president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein (1937\u20132006) was a brutal dictator. His cruelty is evident in the sites of mass graves across the country that he ruled with an iron fist. The Iraqi people themselves testified to the atrocities to which their relatives were subjected. According to The White House website, Iraqi citizens were beaten, tortured, executed by dynamite, gassed, raped, shocked, attacked by dogs and lions, and subjected to medical experiments. In one case, an infant\u2019s eye was gouged out before her skull was crushed by her being thrown against a wall. At Hussein\u2019s son Uday\u2019s direction, Olympic athletes were humiliated by being \u201csmeared with feces and jailed or placed inside [sarcophagi] with nails pointed inward so they would be punctured and suffocated.\u201d<\/p> <p>The same barbaric dictator wrote both poetry and four novels, including Zabibah and the King, an allegorical love story. In fact, a U.S. government translator not only read but also studied Hussein\u2019s book. As a result, the CIA concluded that, although Hussein himself probably didn\u2019t actually pen the novel\u2019s words, he had \u201ccarefully supervised its production and suffused it with his own words and ideas.\u201d The U.S. government\u2019s summary of the novel states that \u201cSaddam\u2019s style, sentence structure, and expressions are clearly present in the novel.\u201d In other words, it seems that, although Zabibah and the King was largely ghost-written, it contains a good deal of Hussein\u2019s own personal input. Writing for The New York Times, Elaine Sciolino states that, amid the volume\u2019s \u201crambling, overheated prose,\u201d U.S. officials found \u201can intriguing window into Mr. Hussein\u2019s thinking.\u201d<\/p> <p>Set in the ancient world, the narrative is a love story featuring a powerful king (a stand-in for Hussein himself) and Zabibah, a beautiful villager who represents the people of Iraq. The king tells his beloved that he is a great leader who must be both obeyed and loved. In the process of the lengthy exchanges of dialogue between the lovers, the king shares his views on \u201cGod, politics, love, family, loyalty, betrayal and the will of the people\u201d as well as his own \u201cinsecurities.\u201d<\/p> <p>The otherwise tender romance also includes a scene in which Zabibah is raped, \u201can obvious reference to the United States invasion of Iraq at the end of the Persian Gulf war,\u201d Sciolino remarks, although U.S. officials interpreted the scene as Hussein\u2019s take on what he saw as \u201cIsrael\u2019s treatment of Palestinians.\u201d The novel ends with the deaths of both Zabibah and the king on January 17th, the same day that the United States-led coalition began bombing Baghdad as part of the war to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. The lovers\u2019 bodies are buried side by side \u201cso that the people can throw stones on his grave to desecrate it on the anniversary of his death.\u201d<\/p> <p>In addition to Zabibah and the King, Hussein wrote The Fortified Castle (2001), Men and the City (2002), and Bygone Demons (2006).[10]<\/p> <p>fact checked by Darci Heikkinen<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3AJA9FLWSEDYZNJDPOVCU2CFCJRIFM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":654,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1933.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Soviet Union","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Osip Emilievich Mandelstam","victim_keywords":"Russian poet, Stalin, exiled","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Moroccan citizens, killed, decapitation, burned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Iraqi citizens, toture, muder, rape, experimentation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"1933.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Soviet Union","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Osip Emilievich Mandelstam","victim_keywords":"Russian poet, Stalin, exiled","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Moroccan citizens, killed, decapitation, burned","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Iraqi citizens, toture, muder, rape, experimentation","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":960557381,"Input.title":"Insecurity: 50 foreigners kidnapped in 3 years","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-20 03:04:34","Input.article_interface":"<p>Delta, Ebonyi, Cross River, Lagos, Taraba, Ekiti, Oyo lead<\/p> <p>Nigeria among 10 top African countries on kidnapping map<\/p> <p>More than 50 foreign nationals have been kidnapped for ransom in Nigeria within three years, Daily Trust on reports.<\/p> <p>A global risk consultancy firm, Control Risks, said Nigeria had the highest rate of kidnapping in Africa, while a United States-based security consultancy outfit, Constellis, in a report, said Nigeria was among the top 10 countries in the world that were notorious for kidnapping foreign nationals for ransom.<\/p> <p>An investigation by our reporters, including reported cases in the media between 2018 and 2020, show that those kidnapped were in Nigeria for business and diplomatic activities.<\/p> <p>The cases exclude many abductions that have not been reported because families of the victims preferred to sort out their troubles without involving the state.<\/p> <p>While some of the victims were carefully monitored by their abductors ahead of picking them up, others were seized by the kidnappers on highways.<\/p> <p>Some of the kidnapped victims lost their lives while in custody or during rescue effort by security operatives.<\/p> <p>Some Nigerian security personnel also lost their lives or sustained grievous injuries while struggling to rescue the victims of the abductions.<\/p> <p>A timeline of the kidnaps<\/p> <p>In 2020, 19 foreigners, mostly company workers, were taken hostage in Delta, Ebonyi, Cross River, Lagos, Taraba, Ekiti and Oyo states.<\/p> <p>Out of the 50 foreigners kidnapped, only two Indians who were abducted recently in Ibadan, Oyo State, are still in captivity.<\/p> <p>The two Indians were kidnapped on December 9, 2020, at a pharmaceutical firm close to the toll gate along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.<\/p> <p>Confirming the incident, the spokesman of the police in Oyo State, Olugbenga Fadeyi, said they were making effort to rescue the Indians.<\/p> <p>There is no information so far on whether the kidnappers have made contact with the families of the expatriates.<\/p> <p>On December 12, 2020, a Lebanese national, Hassan Mills, was kidnapped at the entrance of Panorama Farm at Mekun, Ibadan, also in Oyo State.<\/p> <p>A soldier and a civilian who attempted to rescue him were killed in the process.

More than 30 such assaults were recorded in 2018 with the majority of them particularly targeting journalists who were covering stories at national events, at blast sites covering the aftermath of Al-Shabaab attacks, during demonstrations against government policies and while going through security checkpoints in Mogadishu.<\/p> <p>Apart from these, the authorities in Mogadishu, those in Puntland as well as in Somaliland, have raided and temporarily closed media outlets to prevent or discourage coverage of news events, to extort money from media owners or as retaliation against the media outlet for being critical.<\/p> <p>The year 2019 also ended as multiple actors continued to target journalists and media professionals in Somalia. While the number of journalists killed in Somalia was considerably less than in previous years, the level of arbitrary arrests, attacks and suspensions remained high in 2019 across Somalia.<\/p> <p>According to data compiled by the Somali Journalists Syndicate (SJS), 53 cases of arbitrary arrests were recorded. There were also 81 incidents of physical assaults. Three of these journalists were severely wounded, two of them after being shot.<\/p> <p>There were also death threats against journalists, and obstruction of access to information during the year.<\/p> <p>Seven media houses were also shut across the country during 2019. Police in Puntland were extremely aggressive to the media and carried out four raids on independent media houses for investigative news reports deemed critical of the state.<\/p> <p>The politically sensitive elections that took place in the regional states during 2019 could partially explain the high level of state-led attacks on the press. According to interviews with journalists, officials routinely ordered the detention of journalists as an intimidation exercise to quell critical stories. This trend may explain why the majority of journalists\u2019 detentions took place without any charges presented across Somalia in 2019.<\/p> <p>Key red lines for coverage remain across the country. In 2019, there were at least 15 incidents of preventing journalists from covering bombing sites and other security related incidents in Mogadishu. Other areas such as reporting on human rights abuses, especially those perpetrated by state actors, remain another \u201cno-go\u201d area for the Somali press. Online expression is further curbed after state actors repeatedly targeted and harassed journalists on the Internet for any critical personal social media posts.<\/p> <p>Further, in 2019 alone, 12 journalists were forced into exile for fear of imprisonment or death at the hands of Al-Shabaab or from officials of the Somali government and regional states. With a deteriorating press freedom environment, the use of restrictive laws and the criminalization of critical reporting, Somaliland, where the government crackdown on independent media and journalists scaled up during 2019, is on the top of the list of places journalists fled during the year, followed by Jubbaland, Mogadishu and Puntland.<\/p> <p>The situation has not, however, improved in 2020. Just in the first five months of the year, two journalists were murdered. On 16 February 2020, armed assailants in Afgoye, a town just about 30km from the capital, assassinated 25-year-old freelance journalist Abdiwali Ali Hassan while he was returning from work and on 4 May 2020, at least one attacker armed with a knife fatally stabbed journalist Said Yusuf Ali, a reporter for the local Kalsan TV. According to the journalist\u2019s family, despite an initial police report about the arrest of the killer, no credible investigation was opened and no justice was served.<\/p> <p>Eight other journalists, including a female TV reporter, have been wounded in the line of duty this year. The police and government officials perpetrated two of these incidents.<\/p> <p>Moreover on June 25, 2020, a uniformed Somali police officer shot and injured a journalist, Abdifatah Abduqadir Sharif, as he was leaving work to head to his home in Mogadishu. On May 4, 2020, a group of police and officials assaulted and injured Shabelle TV female reporter Safiya Aden Osman and her cameraman Abdulkadir Ga\u2019al while they were covering a protest in Mogadishu. Authorities have failed to open any credible investigation to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book.<\/p> <p>As of the end of September, about 32 journalists have been arbitrarily arrested countrywide with most of them briefly detained and released without charge. However, two journalists, Abdiaziz Ahmed Gurbiye from Goobjoog Media and Mohamed Abduwahab Abuuja, were jailed for an extended period by the authorities in Mogadishu. Gurbiye was arrested on April 14, 2020 after he wrote an article alleging that the President had taken away a donated ventilator from a local hospital. He was later released after paying a fine. Abuuja on the other hand was detained on March 7, 2020 and held incommunicado for five months for writing an article criticizing the Somali security forces. He was taken to the Military Court on treason and terrorism charges and was freed in August after the court quashed the charges due to lack of evidence.<\/p> <p>At least five media houses have been raided and shuttered across the country this year. The federal police, the National Intelligence and Security Forces (NISA) and the regional security forces are the main perpetrators of these violations.<\/p> <p>To further worsen the already alarming press freedom conditions, the Federal President, Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo in late July signed a draconian media law which imposes further restrictions on the independent media and even forces journalists to register on a government-run database or face losing their accreditations.<\/p> <p>The vaguely worded provisions, such as those prohibiting reporting on issues conflicting with \u201cnational interest\u201d, \u201cspreading false information\u201d, \u201cincitement to violence and clannism\u201d as well as \u201cdissemination of propaganda\u201d, also permit the state Attorney General to prosecute journalists. The Ministry of Information also has a broad mandate to regulate media and media practitioners and could simply bar certain individuals from practicing their journalistic profession.<\/p> <p>There is a grave concern about the chilling effect that this media law will have on the right to freedom of expression. The fear over this new Law has already resulted in journalists and media outlets having to resort to self-censorship.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Somali authorities in the capital and in the regional states continue to use the country\u2019s outdated Penal Code that was first adopted in 1964, to prosecute and charge journalists.<\/p> <p>The Penal Code also limits freedom of expression by criminalizing various forms of expression and conduct by journalists such as:<\/p> <p>defamation,<\/p> <p>offending the honour and prestige of the head of state,<\/p> <p>publication or dissemination of false, exaggerated or tendentious news,<\/p> <p>insulting a public officer or institution,<\/p> <p>contempt against the nation, state or flag, or Islamic religion.<\/p> <p>Most of these offences attract penalties including sentences of up to three years in prison.<\/p> <p>The threat to a free press was recently exacerbated by President Farmajo who is seeking his second term re-election. During a public address he made on 26 September 2020, the President linked journalists and media houses critical of his administration to the terror group Al-Shabaab.<\/p> <p>In addition to the generalized ongoing violence against journalists, authorities in Somalia have often invoked alleged national security concerns and the fight against Al-Shabaab as a basis to attack journalists, shut down media houses, restrict the right to freedom of expression and access to information. Therefore, such comments against journalists by the country\u2019s leader in a particularly critical time ahead of the national elections would only amount to an imminent threat to Somalia\u2019s press freedom.<\/p> <p>Details of some of the violations recorded from January 2018 \u2013 September 2020 can be found in our report on The State of Press Freedom in Somalia which will be published on October 28, 2020.<\/p> <p>Members of AFEX:<\/p> <p>ADISI-Cameroon<\/p> <p>Africa Freedom of Information Centre<\/p> <p>Association for Media Development in South Sudan<\/p> <p>Center for Media Studies

Waititi","Input.publish_date":"2019-10-23 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Jojo Rabbit is almost here. Get your tickets now!<\/p> <p>Taika Waititi\u2019s films take place in worlds where the heightened and the everyday are one and the same. In What We Do in the Shadows, Vampires (as well as werewolves and other varieties of supernatural folk) exist. They\u2019re as likely to quarrel over whose turn it is to do dishes as they are to brawl over one of their number cluelessly alerting an amateur vampire hunter. In Hunt for the Wilderpeople, a would-be-tough teenager and his surly adoptive uncle flee into the New Zealand bush to escape from the government. The development of their relationship is as important to their survival as is evading their increasingly relentless pursuers. In Thor: Ragnarok, the Norse god of thunder\u2019s long-lost sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) returns from exile, vowing to conquer existence. Thor coming to terms with his late father Odin (Anthony Hopkins)\u2019s failings and his own doubts is vital to stopping her \u2013 even more than learning to wield his powers to their fullest extent. The worlds Waititi spins and the tales he tells are gloriously zonked and frequently hilarious. Simultaneously they\u2019re insightful, thoughtful studies of humanity. Furthermore, Waititi depicts evil as something intensely dweeby. Waititi\u2019s villains, even Blanchett\u2019s fairly stern Hela, are lost in their own worlds. They\u2019re clueless and more than a bit absurd. It\u2019s funny. And, once the laughter subsides, a fairly astute observation on the nature of wickedness.<\/p> <p>What We Do in the Shadows\u2019 vampire flatmates are the picture\u2019s protagonists but, lovable though they are, they\u2019re all at least a little bit evil. They kill casually \u2013 one memorable argument between Waititi\u2019s Viago and Jemaine Clement\u2019s Vladislav turns on the latter ruining the former\u2019s antique couch by getting blood all over it. Viago is far more upset about his furniture than he is some poor schmuck getting gnawed on. Yes, drinking blood comes with the vampire package, but the disregard with which they treat their victims stands out given that they can and do care about people \u2013 charmingly milquetoast software developer Stu (Stu Rutherford) for instance, or Viago\u2019s beloved Katherine (Ethel Robinson). But, when it comes time for a snack someone they don\u2019t care about might as well be a sandwich \u2013 ideally a sandwich that no one has had sex with. Beyond their frequent murders, the flatmates can be impressively oblivious to anyone\u2019s needs other than their own. Case in point, Vladislav describes his infamous history as a torturer as a sign that \u201cI was in a bad place.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hunt for the Wilderpeople\u2019s overzealous child services worker Paula (Rachel House) does not murder people willy-nilly. But her contempt for a boy she\u2019s supposed to be protecting and her obsession with being an action hero reveal her morality to be severely warped all the same. Wilderpeople\u2019s young hero Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) has had a rough go. He\u2019s built up a hard-edged shell to protect himself and done his fair share of acting out. Paula sees Ricky only as \u201ca real bad egg.\u201d She speaks of his assorted misdemeanors as though they were the crimes of a master criminal. And when Ricky takes off into the bush rather than return to the foster system after his adoptive Aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata)\u2019s death, Paula goes to war. She continually escalates her conflict with Ricky until she\u2019s riding an armored personnel carrier and commanding a fleet of police and hunters in pursuit of the boy and his adoptive Uncle Hec (Sam Neill). As Wilderpeople progresses, Paula comes to view her pursuit of Ricky and Hec as a grand battle, one in which she\u2019s the crusading hero:<\/p> <p>Never mind that Paula\u2019s supposed to be the one advocating for Ricky. Never mind that New Zealand child services are in no way equivalent to the movie version of American police. Never mind that the level of force she ultimately brings to bear in her hunt for Ricky is so disproportionate that it crosses into the realm of the absurd. Paula\u2019s the hero. At best, Ricky is an object to be retrieved. At worst, he\u2019s her villain.<\/p> <p>Thor: Ragnarok\u2019s two primary villains \u2013 Blanchett\u2019s Hela and Jeff Goldblum\u2019s Grandmaster, operate at both macro and micro levels of wickedness. Hela\u2019s grand speeches and plots of universal conquest coexist alongside her pettily abusive behavior to her younger brothers Thor and Loki. The Grandmaster\u2019s thinly painted-on affability and oozing sleaze coexist alongside his breathtaking cruelty and masterminding of a culture that has put him on top of everyone else. While their motivations and personalities are starkly different from one another, both Hela and the Grandmaster display an unsettling, almost childish drive to be the most important person in the world. Grandmaster constantly needs to burnish his own self-image \u2013 whether through emphasizing that the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is his gladiatorial champion or trying to claim credit for the revolution that rose up to overthrow him. Hela is less openly needy in her pursuit of power and recognition. But her confrontations with Loki and Thor consistently see her try to belittle and bully them. She conflates their very existence with Odin\u2019s decision to erase her (and Asgard\u2019s time as an actively imperial power) from history \u2013 one of many moral failures on his part, but one his sons are in no way responsible for. It is not enough for Hela to overthrow her brothers and return Asgard to its warmongering days. No, she aims to repay her father\u2019s insult by breaking his other children \u2013 as if by maiming and mocking Thor she will affirm her own might. It\u2019s telling that, during their climactic battle, Hela aims to humiliate Thor first and kill him second \u2013 still trying to make the same point to him she had already made when she shattered Mjolnir.<\/p> <p>Evil, in Taika Waititi\u2019s films, is both fundamentally ridiculous and fundamentally blinkered. His heroes may be eccentric goofballs themselves, but they possess an awareness of the world and an emotional intelligence that enables them to grow and change. Ricky Baker, Hec, Thor and even What We Do in the Shadows\u2019 evil-but-capable-of-empathy vampires are changed by their experiences. Paula, Grandmaster and Hela remain static \u2013 too caught up in their obsessions and foibles to do anything but charge forwards and demand the world change to suit their desires. They pay no mind to other people because other people aren\u2019t a part of their worlds beyond the most superficial level. They\u2019re hilarious. They\u2019re dreadful. They\u2019re malignant dweebs. And, when setting aside the heightened nature of their actions, they\u2019re a sharp study of how pathetic that sort of cruelty and viciousness truly is.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3IKMEYR0LYA54OXP1W1HNZX3VJC2KY"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":667,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Movie, films, review, actors, actress","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["unknown"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Movie, films, review, actors, actress","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1032633994,"Input.title":"Labor leader released after court junks \u2018fabricated charges\u2019","Input.publish_date":"2022-03-09 01:17:51","Input.article_interface":"<p>MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Labor leader Dennise Velasco was finally set free on Tuesday after a Quezon City Regional Trial Court dismissed an illegal firearms case filed against him.<\/p> <p>Velasco was among the seven human rights activists arrested in December 2020 on what the National Union of Peoples\u2019 Lawyers (NUPL) called \u201cfabricated charges.\u201d<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>\u201cOur client is now free!

Reports from the facility indicate high levels of assault towards inmates by other inmates and prison staff, as well as rampant drug use and infectious diseases.<\/p> <p>In December last year, Saba Kordafshari, a human rights defender, was also transferred from Evin to Shahr-e Rey prison.<\/p> <p>Zeynab Jalalian, a Kurdish Iranian woman, was moved to four different prisons between April and November last year including Yazd, Evin and Kermanshah. She has described prison transfers as a type of mental torture. She was not allowed to take her personal belongings, including clothes, with her and said she had been denied healthcare, which caused her more suffering, especially as she recovered from Covid-19.<\/p> <p>In January, Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee was moved almost 120 miles (200km) from Shahr-e Rey to Amol prison in northern Iran without notice and deprived of her personal possessions. She had already served one sentence when she was imprisoned again in November 2019 for \u201cinsulting the supreme leader\u201d and \u201cspreading propaganda against the system\u201d. In an open letter, her husband wrote that guards had dragged her across the floor by her hair.<\/p> <p>Atena Daemi, a women\u2019s rights activist, has been sentenced in two further cases for peacefully protesting while serving time for campaigning against the death penalty in Iran. She was transferred suddenly, and without notice, from Evin prison to Lakan prison in Gilan province, north-west of Tehran, last month.<\/p> <p>Also in March, Sepideh Gholian, a human rights defender, was transferred from Evin prison to Bushehr prison, which is nearly 300 miles from her family home. And Maryam Akbari Monfared was transferred from Evin prison to Semnan prison, east of Tehran. She is serving a 15-year sentence and has been in prison since 2009 without a single day of leave.<\/p> <p>Monireh Arabshahi, left, and Yasaman Aryani were transferred from Evin prison to a facility in Karaj, Alborz province.<\/p> <p>Yasaman Aryani and Monireh Arabshahi were transferred in October last year from the women\u2019s ward of Evin prison to one in Karaj, Alborz province.<\/p> <p>Papayianni said that all the women had been wrongfully convicted and should be released. \u201cAt Amnesty International, we believe that none of them should be in prison at all. We believe all their sentences are unjust and that they should be immediately released.\u201d She added that the situation for these women was deteriorating and that transferring women was commonly used to silence detainees, particularly when they had campaigned from behind bars.<\/p> <p>Mahbobi said that she suspected the increasing number of transfers were part of a political move to close Evin prison, where most political prisoners are traditionally held, in an effort to declare that Iran does not detain human rights defenders.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite dangerous\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really alarming. On one hand, they can send these prisoners to prisons that are really unimaginable and put their lives in danger, and then [the government] can claim they don\u2019t have any political prisoners.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Iranian government has been approached for

have the right to protest peacefully, and a right to express their opinions, including on social media\" following an unprecedented clampdown on civil liberties.<\/p> <p>In the past two months alone, the Egyptian regime has been accused of torturing human rights activists Alaa Abdel Fattah and Esraa Abdel Fattah, and detaining more than 2,000 people in response to protests that broke out on 20 September.<\/p> <p>The regime's reaction has not only reinforced Sisi's repressive and authoritarian reputation, it has also brought into sharp focus the West's selective condemnation of human rights abuses around the world.<\/p> <p>In the name of bolstering regional and international security, western governments have disregarded the very real threats facing ordinary Egyptians every day.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch estimates that since taking power in 2014, Sisi has been responsible for imprisoning over 60,000 people on political grounds. Additionally, \"torture is a systematic practice\" in the country, according to the UN Committee Against Torture.<\/p> <p>Despite this, there has been a noticeably muted response from the US and European governments.<\/p> <p>Western governments continue to provide the regime with the technology, training and equipment that enable such atrocities to occur<\/p> <p>Four days after the most recent protests began, Boris Johnson met his Egyptian counterpart at the UN General Assembly in New York, where they spoke of the \"two countries' economic ties and the importance of building on this after the UK leaves the EU,\" with no mention whatsoever of the rights abuses occurring in the country.<\/p> <p>Similarly, Trump defended Sisi at a recent press conference, saying: \"Egypt has a great leader. He's highly respected.\"<\/p> <p>Not only has there been a steadfast refusal to acknowledge many of the accusations made by human rights organisations, but western governments continue to provide the regime with the technology, training and equipment that enable such atrocities to occur.<\/p> <p>[Click to enlarge]<\/p> <p>Their continued support falls short of their international human rights obligations and contradicts their professed support for civil liberties around the world.<\/p> <p>As an act passed last week in Congress made clear: \"It is the policy of the United States to restrict the export of security assistance and crime control and detection instruments and equipment to any government that engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognised human rights.\"<\/p> <p>The act prohibits the sale of tear gas to the Hong Kong police amid concerns of widespread police brutality and human rights abuses.<\/p> <p>And yet, the US continues to provide $1.3 billion a year to the Egyptian regime in security assistance, while recognising \"Egypt's poor record on human rights and democratisation.\"<\/p> <p>Although the security assistance and military training exercises are ostensibly aimed at fostering international and regional stability - particularly in relation to neighbouring Libya - they have also emboldened an increasingly totalitarian regime and ignored the plight of Egyptian citizens.<\/p> <p>They have emboldened an increasingly totalitarian regime and ignored the plight of Egyptian citizens<\/p> <p>Support does not just come from foreign governments, however. American companies also stand accused of complicity in the silencing of dissent within Egypt.<\/p> <p>Wael Eskander, an independent journalist based in Cairo, found that Twitter was suspending a large number of accounts that were \"critical of the Egyptian government at a time when online interaction was high and translated to possible action on the ground\".<\/p> <p>The regime has increasingly sought to restrict all forms of freedom of expression, including online. During the recent protests, for example, the regime blocked access to the BBC and Alhurra, leaving citizens reliant on VPN apps to access popular news services.<\/p> <p>The UK - Egypt's single largest foreign investor - fares no better. According to the UK government's website: \"This is a historic moment for Egypt and the region. Egypt's transition to a democratic state has the potential to be the role model for many other states in the region.\"<\/p> <p>The tone-deaf nature of the statement is made more alarming by evidence that the UK has licensed the sale of over $77 million worth of spyware and surveillance technologies to a range of authoritarian countries in the region, including Egypt.<\/p> <p>As I've noted before, the increasingly sophisticated nature of Sisi's surveillance and censorship apparatus has been supported by several western companies, including the Italian Hacking Group, and Israeli NSO group.<\/p> <p>France, in particular, has been criticised for its role in bolstering the regime's surveillance capabilities. In a report from last year, Amnesty International and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), uncovered that French companies had supplied Egyptian security services with bulk interception, individual surveillance and personal data acquisition technologies.<\/p> <p>The report argues that with the combination of these resources, France has \"participated in the construction of a widespread surveillance and crowd control architecture aimed at preventing all dissent.\"<\/p> <p>Despite mounting evidence, there is little indication that western governments will begin to challenge the Egyptian regime on their human rights record in any meaningful way.<\/p> <p>Instead, they appear intent on maintaining huge security aid budgets and lucrative trade deals that will only embolden the regime and could lead to a worsening of conditions in Egypt.<\/p> <p>It's time for western governments to officially condemn the human rights abuses occurring under Sisi and call for change. Following this, they must comply with their international human rights obligations and halt the sale of potentially repressive technology to the regime.<\/p> <p>If this doesn't happen, then the West will remain complicit in the clampdown of individual freedoms and must deal with the consequences of supporting a government that, in the words of Human Rights Watch, \"continues to oversee Egypt's

La Tonde\u00f1a to modern day unions: The continuous struggle against dictatorship and oppression","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-22 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By RUTH LUMIBAO<\/p> <p>Bulatlat.com<\/p> <p>MANILA \u2014 \u201cTama na! Sobra na! Wakasan na!\u201d<\/p> <p>The people\u2019s resounding call did not start yesterday. Decades ago, this was the same battle cry against the Marcos dictatorship, originating from one of the most legendary feats of the workers\u2019 movement: the La Tonde\u00f1a strike.<\/p> <p>Only three years after Marcos imposed Martial Law, thousands of people, including about 800 workers of the largest distillery in Asia at that time, braved the wrath of state fascism and picketed to assert their rights. Workers were hired for eight weeks, thereafter terminated, and then rehired as contractuals. They went to the National Labor Relations Commissions (NLRC) \u2013 30 times to be exact \u2013 to no avail. Justifiably, it was in the middle of this massive strike where student activist Edgar Jopson called, \u201cTama na! Sobra na! Welga na!\u201d<\/p> <p>After the La Tonde\u00f1a strike, more than 200 other strikes broke out nationwide. More than 70,000 workers were involved and were supported by the church, youth, women, and other sectors. Their protests took many forms \u2013 silent strikes, sit-down strikes, slowdowns, mass leaves, stretching of the break period, among others.<\/p> <p>Rattled with the resounding call for ouster and justice, the Marcos dictatorship devised means to curtail workers\u2019 rights, ending up with the pro-capitalist Labor Code of the Philippines, an ingrained labor policy that the country hails up to this day, a labor disputes commission marred with bribery and corruption, and undue restriction over the workers\u2019 strongest weapons \u2013 the right to strike, and the right to form unions.<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship\u2019s labor policy<\/p> <p>Prior to the declaration of Martial Law, the Philippine economy was already struck in a spiraling crisis. The National Census and Statistics Office (NCSO; now the Philippine Statistics Authority or PSA) recorded almost a 20-percent rate of unemployment in 1931. According to the 1977 Yearbook of Labor Statistics, 78 percent of the total 6.347 million families in the Philippines in 1971 earned below P3,000 annually, and 41 percent of families earned P2,000 per year. Consequently, a Filipino family would have had to subsist on P5-P8 per day.<\/p> <p>With prevailing economic conditions pushing the Filipino people further into poverty, strikes and uprisings became inevitable. Thus, towards the goal of curtailing the freedom of speech, of organization, and other fundamental human rights, Marcos orchestrated events building up to the imposition of Martial Law.<\/p> <p>To control the spike of strikes and workers\u2019 movements, Marcos made it a point to codify all existing labor laws of the Philippines. Showing utmost subservience to the United States, he welcomed the Rannis Mission with open arms and adopted their recommendations to the labor code \u2013 the same labor code we have up to this day.<\/p> <p>The late Marxist political economist Edberto Villegas explained in his book, \u201cThe Political Economy of Philippine Labor Laws\u201d that the Rannis Mission \u2018pushed for an export-oriented industrialization and liberalization of imports in the Philippines, advising against trade protectionism and import-substitution.\u2019 The mission was named after Gustav Rannis, its head, and was sponsored by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the World Bank (WB).<\/p> <p>Consequently, the Rannis Mission laid the foundations for labor policies that prevail even up to this day.<\/p> <p>1. Heightened export of labor and the OFW phenomenon<\/p> <p>The Labor Code then created the Overseas Employment Development Board (OEDB) and National Seaman Board (NSB) to take care of recruitment for overseas jobs. OEDB looked for employment for Filipinos abroad. Annually, 112,191 workers are deployed abroad, the Middle East being the most common destination.<\/p> <p>Benefitting from these, a journal of the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) cited how much host countries gained from the Filipinos\u2019 cheap labor: US$50.9 billion.<\/p> <p>Supposedly a temporary solution to the lack of jobs in the country, deployment overseas has, rather, become the norm. Dollar-earning remittances became an easy solution for the government to increase revenue without putting out too much from its pockets. It capitalized on the Filipino laborer\u2019s willingness to take on low-paying jobs abroad, lest be stuck inside the country without any job at all. This has left the modern-day heroes now called Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) vulnerable to rights violations and severely abusive work environments.<\/p> <p>2. The institutionalization of contractualization<\/p> <p>In the mid-1970s to 1980s, Marcos issued a decree allowing the hiring of workers on contract for special work, thus marking the beginning of a long struggle against contractualization. This was further institutionalized after being recognized in the Labor Code and with the Department of Labor (DOL) issuing several rules for the implementation of labor contracting and sub-contracting.<\/p> <p>READ MORE: The Mall Empire that Slavery Built<\/p> <p>3. Cheap labor and cost-saving schemes for capitalists<\/p> <p>How else can the government generate jobs? Supposedly, it would be through the strengthening of local industries. But the answer every past administration has to this question is a resounding \u2018open door\u2019 policy. Instead of enhancing workers\u2019 skills, especially that of the youth, the government always rushes to shove them into low-paying, low-skilled jobs.<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship established the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) in 1969. It established training institutions in the country, which according to the Labor Code, \u201cwill ensure the efficient allocation, development and utilization of the nation\u2019s manpower and thereby promote employment\u2026\u201d La Salle School of Arts and Trades, Marikina SAT, Bataan SAT, Pangasinan SAT, Iloilo SAT, Bicol University, and a lot more participated in the program.<\/p> <p>Private corporations that promised to shoulder the costs of NMYC training of future laborers were granted a tax deduction of 50 percent. Easily said, the employment of Filipino workers became synonymous with company savings.<\/p> <p>Similarly, the Labor Code produced by the Marcos regime promoted apprenticeship. In principle, it is understood to be training and preparation for a job, but in actuality, the program is abused as a means for cheap labor, child labor, and other workers\u2019 rights violation. Similar to the effect of the institution of NMYC\u2019s training programs, companies that implemented apprenticeship programs were granted a tax deduction of 50 percent.<\/p> <p>Ironically, workers\u2019 productivity and the rise of employment due to this scheme did not encourage the government to increase their wages, and actually resulted in the complete opposite \u2013 the maintenance of cheap wage levels in exchange for a flourishing export program.<\/p> <p>As a result, the number of vocational workers rose quickly, even overtaking the number of agricultural workers in a supposedly agricultural country. And, analogously, the services sector employs the largest number of workers even up to this day.<\/p> <p>4. Anti-union policies and practices<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship did not want another La Tonde\u00f1a, and thus incorporated in the Labor Code and its own implementation of labor laws all means to stop one.<\/p> <p>Under the Labor Code, what seems to be a provision protecting the economy is actually for the protection of investors. The prohibition of strikes in vital industries became a systematic impediment on the workers\u2019 right to strike. According to Marcos\u2019 Letter of Instruction NO. 368, the Secretary of Labor has the discretion on which industries to include and exclude from the list.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, even if the right to strike was still recognized (if not merely mentioned as a formality), the Labor Code prohibited the collection of strike contributions by unions and stated that all strike funds should be transferred to labor education and research purposes. A strike does not usually last for a day, and persists until the employer or management becomes willing to negotiate or to respect the workers\u2019 demands. At that time, and still a reaction to the series of nationwide strikes, Marcos imposed a ban on foreign donations to Philippine trade unions, unless permitted by the Minister of Labor. To deprive them of their capacity to raise funds among themselves for a strike directly affects their right to hold one.<\/p> <p>The Marcos dictatorship likewise played with the classification and re-classification of \u2018unfair labor practices\u2019 or union busting from an administrative offense to a criminal offense. Nonetheless, this did not prevent management from imposing preventive suspension on workers suspected of participating in an upcoming strike. A workers\u2019 argument for unfair labor practices falls, therefore, and becomes relegated to a case of illegal dismissal.<\/p> <p>The establishment of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for compulsory arbitration likewise served as a barrier to the realization of justice and respect for workers\u2019 rights. Briberies were rampant. Amado Inciong, then Undersecretary of the Department of Labor (DOL), narrated in an interview how a manager of the Manila Hilton Hotel paid a commission for \u2018services rendered\u2019. These amounts range from P150,000 to P500,000 each.<\/p> <p>49 years later<\/p> <p>Marcos imposed these policies with the pretense of generating more jobs, boosting the economy, and making the Philippines Asia\u2019s tiger. The reasons go on and on. But so did Aquino. So did Ramos. So did Estrada. So did Arroyo. So did another Aquino. And, presently, so does Duterte, even at a larger and more destructive scale.<\/p> <p>Fast forward 49 years after Marcos imposed Martial Law and used his iron fist to clamp down workers\u2019 rights and workers\u2019 movements, the labor sector continues to rise.<\/p> <p>Crisis cannot be denied. The objective conditions will always push the oppressed to fight. It is but a natural reaction for someone offended to seek justice, and for one deprived of justice to assert. Truth be told, La Tonde\u00f1a strike workers had foreseen it all along: that their victory was not a culmination, but a commencement of a bigger and more all-encompassing struggle against oppression and exploitation.<\/p> <p>The strikes of Nestle, Coca-Cola, NutriAsia, and many other unions are reminders that the legacy of La Tonde\u00f1a strike lives on. A dictatorship, no matter how merciless and seemingly powerful, can never defeat the people\u2019s sovereign will. (RVO)<\/p> <p>Reference:<\/p> <p>Villegas, E. M. (1988).

In the United States, they paid homage to her legacy with a place in the Hispanic Journalism Hall of Fame.<\/p> <p>By Ivette Munguia (Confidencial)<\/p> <p>HAVANA TIMES \u2013 Nicaraguan Ana Real paid for three dinners in Manhattan in order to obtain the interview that television anchor Dan Rather held with then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Although she\u2019d been promised an interview while in Cuba, that promise wasn\u2019t enough to convince this television producer, who would have to transfer the crew and equipment from the United States to Iraq. In the end, though, despite the fact that television channels all over the world were fighting to get an interview, she was the only one to achieve this for CBS.<\/p> <p>Ana was 60 years old when she died last March 27. She had been with CBS since 2001, most currently as the foreign news producer for CBS News. She was always true to her convictions and, as her husband Miguel Real recalls: \u201cShe did things because she wanted to do them; she didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval.\u201d He adds that things in the US culture don\u2019t usually work like that, but \u201cit worked for her\u201d.<\/p> <p>Interviewing Hussein was a main aspiration for all of the most powerful television channels in the world during 2003. Ana glimpsed the possibility of landing such an interview when she travelled to Cuba with her CBS News team to interview Fidel Castro. On that occasion, the Cuban regime disappointed her seconds before the interview, after having promised them an exclusive. She was furious, and yelled at them \u2013 \u201cHypocrites! You\u2019re all full of crap.\u201d Everyone there was horrified, until Castro\u2019s lawyer approached her.<\/p> <p>\u201cAna, take it easy. If I could give you something, what would you ask for?\u201d he asked her.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf I could ask you for anything, I\u2019d like an interview with Saddam Hussein,\u201d she responded.<\/p> <p>When Ana returned from Cuba, she pitched the idea of the interview with Hussein to CBS News, but no one believed it would be possible. There was about a one percent chance of obtaining what many considered impossible, but she was convinced that they had nothing to lose, and if they did get the interview, they had a lot to gain.<\/p> <p>Ana had a broad network of contacts around the world, which she had gathered through the work she did. Those contacts and her skill at \u201casking and landing things\u201d were the levers she used in a Manhattan restaurant to \u201cobtain\u2026the interview with Saddam Hussein, at a time when there were thousands of international media outlets seeking such an interview,\u201d explains Miguel.<\/p> <p>He also attributes to her the incomparable coverage CBS provided on the arrest of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, head of the Mexican cartel. She also produced in-depth stories about the survivors of the earthquake in Haiti, and about the questionable practices of the international adoption agencies, reports that won her two Emmy\u2019s.<\/p> <p>Her first steps<\/p> <p>Before her successful career as a television producer in the U.S., Ana and her husband Miguel spent time in a number of countries in Latin America, covering stories and reporting on major events for international agencies. They informed about wars, natural disasters, and on two occasions they had to flee authoritarian regimes who were unhappy with the investigative work that Miguel did.<\/p> <p>Ana began in the world pf journalism without having planned to do so. In 1984, as a recent graduate in Hotel Administration her vision was aimed more at working in tourism and the service industry.<\/p> <p>She returned to Nicaragua after studying in the United States and found work at the Intercontinental Hotel, the largest and most prestigious of the era. However, the war brought the arrival of dozens of journalists and international agencies, who installed themselves in the Managua hotel. This tied her to the call to tell the stories, and she never looked back.<\/p> <p>\u201cI helped them with contacts and logistics. Suddenly, I found myself involved more with journalism than with the hotel business, and I began as a \u201cfreelance producer\u201d, Ana recalled during a 2015 interview with Confidencial.<\/p> <p>Among the reporters that were covering the war in Nicaragua was Mexican Miguel Real. He and Ana met in a bar that was right next door to the hotel where she was working. They became good friends, and he invited her to Guatemala. She had been planning to get married, but Miguel persuaded her to accompany him for a week. While they were in Guatemala, Miguel was dispatched to Mexico to cover the 1985 earthquake there. Ana went with him. \u201cThat\u2019s when she really began her career, when she discovered a taste for journalism,\u201d Miguel recalls.<\/p> <p>Ana\u2019s wedding was cancelled, and she began her relationship with Miguel. \u201cWe went to live in El Salvador,\u201d recounts her widower. At the end of the decade of the 80s, Ana was working as a freelancer for the international news channels that came to cover the war in El Salvador.<\/p> <p>She later traveled to Venezuela, Columbia, all over Central America, and the Caribbean, among other countries. During the nineties, the family settled in Peru, but they were later expelled by the regime of Alberto Fujimori due to Miguel\u2019s investigative work.<\/p> <p>After their abrupt departure from Peru, Ana, together with her spouse and children, moved to the United States. There she worked first for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Later, in 2001, she joined CBS, the Columbia Broadcasting System.<\/p> <p>She was passionate about her work. She would answer the telephone 24 hours a day, even though this habit caused some marital discussions. For her, the production was \u201cthe heart of the story,\u201d as she told Confidencial magazine in 2015.<\/p> <p>She touched the life of many people<\/p> <p>Ana\u2019s passion for journalism went beyond her work. She became a mentor for many people; she led teams of reporters all over the world; and she was president of the local chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in New York City, advising young journalism students.<\/p> <p>\u201cShe helped them present themselves, not to diminish themselves in front of the US industry people. She\u2019d tell them that they had to be themselves, that we have worth as Latinos,\u201d Miguel remembers.<\/p> <p>In a posthumous homage held at the beginning of September, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists hung the name of Ana Real in the Hispanic Journalists\u2019 Hall of Fame, a distinction that has also been received by journalists such as Rosental Alves, founder and director of the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, and Maria Elena Salinas.<\/p> <p>In the same event, Ingrid Ciprian-Mathews, executive vice president of professional strategic development for CBS News, emphasized: \u201cUndoubtedly, Ana was special. She had distinctive qualities that made her unforgettable to her many friends, colleagues, apprentices, and acquaintances all over the world.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThrough her charm, curiosity and ingenuity, she always got the story. And through her disarming sense of identification with other people, she faced up to all the challenges, because her objective was the story. This scholarship will continue her legacy and inspire the next generation of journalists,\u201d Ciprian-Matthews continued.<\/p> <p>Alberto B. Mendoza, executive director of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists emphasized: \u201cAna was an incredibly talented journalist who always saw the best in the students and really believed in them and in their success within the field. Those who had the opportunity to know her were anxious to learn from her, and the students who receive this scholarship will have the honor of following in the steps of one of the most influential leaders of journalism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Another way of honoring Ana Real\u2019s legacy was by creating a scholarship fund for journalism students in the United States. The first two scholarships will be awarded starting in 2020, and the winners will receive $5,000 to be used for tuition, lodging, food and books.<\/p> <p>Nicaraguan journalist Tifani Roberts feels that Ana \u201creached the top\u201d. She never went on the air herself, but, as Roberts noted: \u201cshe had a lot of influence behind the scenes: What would be covered? How would it be covered?\u201d<\/p> <p>During the outbreak of the civic rebellion in Nicaragua, \u201cAna Clemencia pushed and pushed. CBS became the only one of the US broadcast networks to send their foreign news teams to Nicaragua to cover the crisis. That was thanks to her,\u201d Roberts states.<\/p> <p>She adds that the last time she saw Ana, she was there with her team from CBS News conducting interviews outside of El Chipote, an infamous jail in Nicaragua, where many of the protesters were held and tortured.<\/p> <p>Her husband, Miguel Real, also believes that \u201cAna\u2019s frustrated dream\u201d was to see the fall of Daniel Ortega\u2019s regime, but she didn\u2019t live long enough.<\/p> <p>Unique, determined, proactive, generous<\/p> <p>Long before becoming a successful news producer, traveling the world and molding dozens of journalists, Ana Clemencia Padilla (her maiden name) was a young girl from the middle classes who enjoyed interacting with the tourists that passed through the port town of Corinito, the most important port in Nicaragua during the era of cotton growing. That\u2019s where she spent her early years, due to the work of her father, Jose Padilla Ramirez, who was at that time a well-known physician.<\/p> <p>Born in Managua on September 24, 1958, she was the youngest of four children from the marriage of Dr. Jose Padilla and Rafaela Lopez de Padilla. Sometime later, the family moved to Corinto. She had a happy childhood, and \u201cwas a generous person,\u201d recalls her sister Patricia Padilla.<\/p> <p>Ana Patricia\u2019s voice breaks when she remembers Ana. She pauses and later says: \u201c[She was] my soul sister. We were best friends, we loved each other so much, we were close.\u201d<\/p> <p>When Ana and her brothers and sisters were teenagers, the family returned to Managua. She was about to graduate from high school when her school collapsed during the earthquake that destroyed Managua in 1972. She finished high school in an improvised classroom.<\/p> <p>In the mid-seventies, the revolutionary movement against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza gained strength, and Ana\u2019s parents decided to send her to the United States to avoid her getting involved. In that country she lived with different families, learned English, and later was able to study tourism.<\/p> <p>While Ana and Miguel were traveling the world and reporting on the most important events, they also had two children, Ana Carolina and Miguel. \u201cWe were a different kind of parents,\u201d Miguel recalls, explaining that his children grew up amid wars and natural disasters, until the family finally decided to put down roots in the United States.<\/p> <p>Optimistic until the end<\/p> <p>On March 27, 2019, five months after she was diagnosed with leukemia, Ana Real passed away. She was 60. The illness surprised her during a vacation trip to Mexico, but she was convinced that she\u2019d beat the cancer. However, her body couldn\u2019t resist the bone marrow transplant, and she died from multiple organ failure.<\/p> <p>Ana\u2019s leukemia was \u201ca scientific case study,\u201d Miguel explains. Her type of leukemia is little known since her bone marrow was apparently clear of cancerous cells, but in some way or another they were producing the disease. That\u2019s why she decided to submit to a bone marrow transplant that her body in the end couldn\u2019t hold up under.<\/p> <p>\u201cReally, until minutes before her death, we were certain that everything was going to come out well,\u201d recounts Miguel. The strength that Ana transmitted to her loved ones made them think that everything would be alright.<\/p> <p>Her sister Patricia says: \u201cAna was so generous that she never told us the seriousness of her illness, although she knew it. She was battling, but I think that she didn\u2019t want to have her loved ones close to her, because we would be suffering.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ana Real wasn\u2019t very religious, but she was very spiritual. She lived her life to the limit and served others, determined as only she could be. Only the disease could put an end to the life of one of the most outstanding Nicaraguan journalists in the international media.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3F6045TU7F3WNCZXI8P77DR1QUC993"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1141,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"El Chipote","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protesters, Nicaragua, El Chipote","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"El Chipote","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protesters, Nicaragua, El Chipote","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":920243745,"Input.title":"Explained: As Saudi Arabia abolishes flogging, a look at how it crushes dissent in the kingdom","Input.publish_date":"2020-04-29 11:21:37+05:30","Input.article_interface":"<p>On Saturday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state human rights commission said that the country has abolished flogging as a punishment for crime. The decision comes just days after leading activist and one of the founding members of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) Abdullah al-Hamid died from a stroke in custody while serving an 11-year prison sentence for multiple charges including \u201cbreaking allegiance\u201d towards the Saudi king and \u201cinciting disorder\u201d.<\/p> <p>In 2014, blogger Raif Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in prison and also sentenced to 1,000 lashes for \u201cinsulting Islam\u201d and for setting up a liberal media forum. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 1 million riyals. Badawi, who was arrested in 2012, had previously called for May 7 to be observed as a \u201cday for Saudi liberals\u201d. The first 50 lashes of his sentence were carried out in public view in Jeddah on January 9, 2015.<\/p> <p>What kind of crimes was flogging a punishment for?<\/p> <p>Before it was abolished, flogging was mandatory as a form of corporal punishment for several offences including murder, breach of peace, homosexuality, consumption or possession of alcohol, adultery, pestering girls, spending time with the opposite sex, insulting Islam and bringing in liqueur chocolates into the country, among others. Before the ban on women drivers was lifted in 2018, any woman caught driving could also be sentenced to flogging. This form of corporal punishment could be used by judges at their discretion as an alternative or in addition to other punishments.<\/p> <p>Now, with flogging abolished, judges will have to choose between fines, jail sentences and non-custodial alternatives such as jail sentences. On Saturday, The Middle East Eye quoted the supreme court as saying that this reform was made in order to \u201cbring the kingdom into line with international human rights norms against corporal punishment\u201d.<\/p> <p>The state of dissent in Saudi Arabia<\/p> <p>Even though Saudi Arabia seems to be progressing towards a more open society, with the ban on women drivers lifted in 2018 and women not requiring permission from their male guardians to apply for a passport anymore, there have been several instances of women rights activists being arrested. In 2019, over a dozen women\u2019s rights activists were charged, according to Amnesty International, for the nature of their human rights work, which includes promoting women\u2019s rights and calling for an end to the male guardianship system.<\/p> <p>It is well known that Saudi Arabia takes a dim view of dissent and has targeted a number of political activists in the recent past. One of the most high-profile cases of targetting political dissidents came to light in 2018, when journalist Jamal Kashoggi, who was a columnist for the Washington Post and a vocal critic of the Saudi regime, was brutally murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has concluded that Kashoggi\u2019s assassination was ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself.<\/p> <p>Another case is of Saudi scholar Salman al-Awdah who called for reform in Saudi Arabia and was ostensibly arrested after his Twitter post on September 9, 2017. He had tweeted: \u201cMay God harmonise between their hearts for the good of their people\u201d. However, it was seen by the Saudi state as a call for reconciliation with Qatar. al-Awdah has been charged with 37 counts and faces the death penalty.<\/p> <p>According to a recently released report by British non-profit Reprieve, Saudi Arabia has carried out its 800th execution under the crown prince\u2019s five year rule and as per Amnesty International the kingdom executed 184 people in 2019.<\/p> <p>The mechanism for targetting political dissidents<\/p> <p>The American Bar Association (ABA) notes that the Saudi authorities created the Specialised Criminal Court (SCC) in 2008 to prosecute thousands of detainees who were kept in detention \u201cwithout charge\u201d since being held after the terrorist attacks \u2014 claimed by al-Qaeda \u2014 inside the kingdom in 2003.

On Sunday October 4, 1936, thousands of members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Moseley organized a march through London\u2019s East End with the intent to commit horrific violence towards London\u2019s Jewish community, which at that time predominantly lived in that area. However, the Jewish community knew an attack might be coming, so the Jewish People\u2019s Council against Fascism and Antisemitism organized a demonstration with Irish dockworkers, socialists, trade unionists, and communists to fight against the fascist attack.<\/p> <p>As the fascists ascended to Cable Street they were also guided by thousands of police officers, who were more than eager to protect them against those the state considered less than desirable. However, they were hit by a roadblock when they were met by the 20,000 strong anti fascist contingency who fought back against the fascist force with anything they could get their hands on, they eventually succeeded in getting Moseley to call his utterly demoralized Blackshirts to retreat. For one day the Jewish community of London could rest, knowing they and their fellow antifascists were able to defeat the fascists and protect the East End from a pogrom.<\/p> <p>For one day.<\/p> <p>This memory of Cable Street has remained in our memory because it serves as a reminder of the narrative Britain has served to establish itself during WWII, a plucky force of people who through resiliency stood together to defeat fascism.<\/p> <p>The reality however, is far more disturbing.<\/p> <p>Because the Battle of Cable Street was just a battle, and the fascists did not suddenly go away. In fact, they had only grown stronger, they had recruited over 2,000 new members. On October 10th, as antifascist demonstrators were marching and celebrating their victory they were greeted by a mass of people \u201cgesturing and screaming \u201cthe Yids, the Yids, we\u2019ve got to get rid of the Yids\u201d. At the corner of Bethnal Green and Roman Road, a double wall of police held back hundreds of young men and women shouting, \u201cup the fascism, dirty Yids\u201d.<\/p> <p>As the fascists were violently clashing with the protesters, this was only meant to serve as a deterrent to the real attack. The rest of the Blackshirts stormed into the East End and attacked Jewish shops and businesses with anything they could get their hands on. Jews were physically thrown out of the windows of their shops, and cars were set ablaze. This became known as the Mile End Pogrom. It was a scene that would not have been out of place in Nazi Germany. One shopkeeper voiced the community\u2019s fears when he said, \u201cI fear this is only the beginning.\u201d For as Hitler\u2019s bombs poured down on London, the Jews of the East End soon faced a new threat in the malice of Winston Churchill.<\/p> <p>While not as genocidal as his views towards colonized people, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, Winston Churchill held deeply antisemitic views which were exacerbated by his longtime support for the Zionist colonial project. As Home Secretary in 1911, Churchill was present at the Battle of Stepney, an armed confrontation between police and Lativan revolutionaries, these revolutionaries were rumored to be Jewish and this influenced Churchill to strengthen the Aliens Act, which would have severely further restricted Jewish refugees from entering the UK.<\/p> <p>The Aliens Act of 1905 was one of the first acts restricting immigration in the UK and it was primarily advocated by the PM at the time Arthur Balfour as an attempt to institute restrictions on Jewish refugees fleeing pogroms in the Russian Empire. Balfour was a notorious antisemite, who later would issue the Balfour Declaration, expressing support for a Jewish state in Palestine. This contradiction was not lost on Britain\u2019s Jews at the time who saw Zionism as a clear attempt to get rid of all Jews on the European continent. For Balfour especially, it also served as a way to propagate his Christian end times theorist desires. It was particularly evident from the very start that Zionism required the support of antisemites for the establishment of their settler colonial state.<\/p> <p>Churchill himself was an ardent Zionist throughout his life, and his term as Home Secretary was not the only time he expressed antisemitic views. He openly propagated Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy theories, and in 1920 he claimed that \u200b\u200b\u201dinternational Jews\u201d were leading a \u201cworld-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation\u201d. Additionally, in 1937 he wrote a paper criticizing the \u201caloofness\u201d and \u201cseparation\u201d of Jews from wider society, and claimed they were \u201cpartly responsible for the antagonism for which they suffer.\u201d<\/p> <p>This culminated when during the London Blitz of 1940-1941, as German bombs were raining down on London, Churchill intentionally left the East End to fend for themselves. Because the East End was predominantly filled with Jews and other immigrants, there was less of a priority to provide them with adequate shelters. In fact, these were the areas which did end up with too few shelters, as after six weeks of bombing a quarter of a million people in the East End had lost their homes and were without shelter. They were forced to resort to using tube stations for shelter, for which 100-150,000 used on any given night.<\/p> <p>The Jewish community of England continued to be terrorized by fascists for years after Cable Street and again by another significant resurgence of Nazism during the 1960\u2019s with Colin Jordan\u2019s National Socialist Movement.<\/p> <p>While Nazism and antisemitism has never truly died out in London\u2013 just as with the rest of Europe, England is inherently built on antisemitism and the persecution of Jews. Still white Jews were able to eventually assimilate into further benefiting from a white supremacist system, especially as more grew to adopt colonialist Zionist views. As the Windrush Generation and other immigrants of color from the former British Empire immigrated to England, they became a more visible target within a country structurally built on white supremacy and colonialism.<\/p> <p>Less than a mile away from Cable Street lies the Altab Ali Park, named in memory of Altab Ali, a Bangladeshi textile worker who was brutally stabbed to death in 1978 by white supremacists, a stark reminder that fascism did not die with Cable Street.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3R16PJFTS56F72CC5AK5GEU1FWA4KW"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":456,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["other"],"year":"1936","month":"October","date":"4.0","city":"London","region":"None","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"England, Jews, Cable Street","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Altab Ali","victim_keywords":"Bangladeshi, textile worker, England, stabbing","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["other"],"year":"1936","month":"October","date":"4.0","city":"London","region":"None","country":"England","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"England, Jews, Cable Street","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Altab Ali","victim_keywords":"Bangladeshi, textile worker, England, stabbing","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":958737846,"Input.title":"Rights Group: Big Data 'Turbocharged' Repression in China Province","Input.publish_date":"2020-12-09 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Muslims in China's Xinjiang province were \"arbitrarily\" selected for arrest by a computer program that flagged suspicious behavior, Human Rights Watch is charging.<\/p> <p>HRW said leaked police data listing over 2,000 detainees from Aksu prefecture was further evidence of \"how China\u2019s brutal repression of Xinjiang\u2019s Turkic Muslims is being turbocharged by technology,\" Agence France-Presse reported Wednesday.<\/p> <p>Beijing has come under international fire over its policies in the resource-rich territory, where rights groups say as many as 1 million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities have been held in internment camps, AFP noted.<\/p> <p>China claims the camps are vocational training centers designed to stamp out terrorism and improve employment opportunities.<\/p> <p>HRW said it obtained a detainees\u2019 list covering mid-2016 to late 2018 that flagged people using a program called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, which collected data from surveillance systems in Xinjiang.

misuse of the power of the presidency\u201d.<\/p> <p>Senator Menendez laid out 10 crucial questions for the Trump-Erdogan meeting (on Wednesday, at 12 pm) that would hold Turkey and Erdogan accountable.<\/p> <p>https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?c4829230\/user-clip-senator-menendez-presents-10-questions-trump-erdogan-visit<\/p> <p>The full text of Senator Menendez\u2019 speech is as follows:<\/p> <p>When President Trump welcomes Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House this week, he will be welcoming a known authoritarian, human rights abuser and friend to Putin whose behavior increasingly runs counter to the interests of the United States and our allies.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s yet another strategic mistake and terrible misuse of the power of the presidency.<\/p> <p>In recent years, the President of Turkey has made a series of decisions to part ways with NATO, with the United States, and with basic principles of democracy.<\/p> <p>Make no mistake: Erdogan\u2019s actions are intentional.<\/p> <p>And it\u2019s stunning to think that any American President would legitimize Erdogan\u2019s harmful policies by welcoming him to the Oval Office.<\/p> <p>M. President, this meeting is a mistake, plain and simple.<\/p> <p>I can only hope that instead of yielding to Erdogan policies that are so squarely at odds with U.S. interests, President Trump treats this misguided meeting as more than just a photo op with yet another dictator.<\/p> <p>The President should instead use this visit to actually stand up for America, for our principles, and for our allies.<\/p> <p>He can do this by raising the many serious questions that Turkey has yet to address. And I would like to use this opportunity to outline ten critical questions, each of which deserve real answers.<\/p> <p>The Ten Questions<\/p> <p>Question number one. Will Turkey reverse course from Erdogan\u2019s decision to buy the S-400 air defense system from Russia?<\/p> <p>The president\u2019s national security advisor claims that the Administration is very \u201cupset\u201d about Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russia\u2019s S-400 weapons system.<\/p> <p>Well, \u201cupset\u201d is not a policy. And it falls well short of the Trump Administration\u2019s legal obligations.<\/p> <p>Under the CAATSA sanctions law, Turkey\u2019s purchase of the S-400 is a significant and sanctionable transaction. These sanctions should have been imposed in July, when Turkey first took delivery of the S-400s.<\/p> <p>And yet, by failing to implement the legal requirements of CAATSA, President Trump has done lasting damage to U.S. credibility, to the integrity of our sanctions, and to the rule of law.<\/p> <p>Is it so much to ask that the President of the United States FOLLOW THE LAW? He can start by imposing CAATSA sanctions when Erdogan is in Washington.<\/p> <p>Question number two. Will our president sanction the activities of Halkbank, a Turkish institution that facilitated the biggest evasion of Iran sanctions in history?<\/p> <p>We know that the Justice Department has finally brought charges in the case. But if the Administration followed the law, they would have already imposed sanctions on Halkbank and sent a message to other actors who seek to evade Iran sanctions.<\/p> <p>I understand that one of Erdogan\u2019s top priorities for his visit to the White House is secure relief for Halkbank.<\/p> <p>M. President, that is THE OPPOSITE of what the law requires. And I hope that President Trump shows some backbone when Erdogan asks him for yet another favor.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani represented Reza Zarrab, one of the players in Halkbank\u2019s sanctions evasion.<\/p> <p>It seems the President Trump likes to talk tough about his sanctions policy on Iran. And yet all the tough talk SUDDENLY STOPS when the interests of his authoritarian pals or his personal lawyer are on the line.<\/p> <p>Question number three. Will our president accept the commission of war crimes in Syria by Turkish-backed forces? The war crimes that he in effect invited Turkey to commit when he greenlighted its invasion of Syria?<\/p> <p>The UN reports that more than 200,000 people have been internally displaced from the so-called \u201csafe zone\u201d controlled by the Turks.<\/p> <p>Some of those displaced have reported that Turkish-backed forces have beaten civilians and conducted kidnappings and summary executions.<\/p> <p>With the pullout of American troops, Turkey was effectively given license to commit these abuses and unleash unspeakable crimes. This is ethnic cleansing.<\/p> <p>So many in this chamber have said Never Again to this kind of horror in the past. Can we depend on President Trump to do the same?<\/p> <p>Last week, I introduced a binding resolution that would require the State Department to report on Turkish human rights abuses in Syria. State\u2019s findings could have a direct bearing on arms sales to Turkey. Meanwhile, we have additional legislation to hold Turkey countable that\u2019s been waiting for a vote for weeks.<\/p> <p>But, where are we? Did we pass the Risch-Menendez bill on Turkey? No.<\/p> <p>Did we pass the House version of that legislation? No.<\/p> <p>Day after day, week after week, we sit on our hands, too timid to act on any legislation that might upset Erdogan while he is in town. What ever happened to standing up for our American values?<\/p> <p>This weekend National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien declared that \u201cthere\u2019s no place for ethnic cleansing, for war crimes in the 21st century.\u201d<\/p> <p>Will President Trump deliver that message to Erdogan on Wednesday?<\/p> <p>Will he seek to maintain any shred of dignity and U.S. credibility on human rights issues? Or will he let Erdogan engage in these horrific human rights abuses without consequence?<\/p> <p>Question number four. Will our president stand up to Turkish aggression against its neighbors throughout the region?<\/p> <p>Turkish navy ships routinely violate the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus and may take measures in Famagusta that would set the peace process on the island back even further.<\/p> <p>Turkey also routinely violates airspace Greece\u2019s airspace, brazenly disregarding Greece\u2019s sovereignty and the safety of Greek pilots and those on the ground below.<\/p> <p>Has President Trump uttered a word of support for our Greek friends? Will he affirm America\u2019s relationship with Greece during Erdogan\u2019s visit to the White House? The EU has developed a sanctions framework that would address Turkey\u2019s actions in the Cypriot EEZ. Will Donald Trump follow suit?<\/p> <p>Question number five. Will our president condemn or accept Erdogan\u2019s warming relationship with the Russian Federation?<\/p> <p>In addition to buying the S-400, Turkey is now in talks to purchase Russian Sukhoi (sook- hoy) aircraft.<\/p> <p>Last week, Erdogan felt the need to coordinate with President Putin prior to coming to the U.S. According to Reuters, he said he would hold a phone call with the Russian President over the weekend to \u201cform the basis\u201d of his talks with President Trump.<\/p> <p>Aside from perhaps Hungary, I can\u2019t imagine any other leader in NATO coordinating with Putin before a conversation with an American president.<\/p> <p>Some say that we need to tread carefully with Turkey lest we push it into Russia\u2019s arms.<\/p> <p>PUSH? Seems to me that Erdogan JUMPED into Putin\u2019s arms long ago with no provocation from us.<\/p> <p>Question number six. Will President Trump call out Erdogan\u2019s assault on the democratic process in Turkey? Will he stick up for civil society groups, university professors and others who\u2019ve been unjustly detained? Will he stick up for journalists there, even as he demonizes the free press here at home?<\/p> <p>More journalists are imprisoned in Turkey than any other country in the world. In the world.<\/p> <p>Under Article Two of the NATO charter, member countries commit to a certain set of democratic principles. This the basis of the alliance.<\/p> <p>At its core, this is why we commit to the mutual defense of these allies. They share our values, our belief in human freedom, in democracy and the rule of law.<\/p> <p>Yet all of Erdogan\u2019s actions over the past few years run afoul of the democratic principles that define the NATO alliance.<\/p> <p>I know that the president does not like to stand up for democracy at home or abroad.<\/p> <p>But I hope that this meeting will be different and that he will finally come to understand what was clear to so many presidents before him, Republican and Democratic alike \u2014 that how a leader treats his own people is indicative for how they will act on the world stage.<\/p> <p>An authoritarian at home is an authoritarian abroad. And both should matter to the United States.<\/p> <p>Question number seven. Will President Trump ignore the violent attacks by Erdogan\u2019s security detail in 2017 against peaceful protestors and DC police?<\/p> <p>The last time Erdogan visited in 2017, his goons did just that, resulting in criminal charges against more than half a dozen members of his security detail.<\/p> <p>During his meeting, President Trump should insist that Erdogan hand over those guards implicated in the 2017 attacks.<\/p> <p>It is clear that Erdogan\u2019s visit will again attract demonstrators \u2013 and rightly so.<\/p> <p>Well, Erdogan may not believe in the right of peaceful protest in his home country. But I hope that Erdogan learned his lesson\u2013 that here in the United States, the right to peaceful assembly is enshrined in our Constitution and core to our democracy.<\/p> <p>And I hope that President Trump clearly reminds him of this fact.<\/p> <p>Question number eight. Will President Trump accept efforts by Turkey to convert Hagia Sophia, which was the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the world for more than 1,000 years, into a mosque?<\/p> <p>Will he advocate for the religious freedom of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who continues to work and live under pressure from the Turkish government?<\/p> <p>Question number nine. Will President Trump ignore Erdogan\u2019s violations of the UN arms embargo on Libya?<\/p> <p>Now, to be fair, Turkey is not the only country funneling weapons to clients in Libya in clear violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1970.<\/p> <p>But the grinding, protracted conflict heightened by these weapons is destabilizing North Africa and allowing for the trafficking and exploitation of desperate migrants and refugees.<\/p> <p>Will President Trump call on all outside powers, including Turkey, to engage in Libya with diplomacy rather than weapons transfers and to encourage the warring parties to find a political solution to the conflict?<\/p> <p>And finally, question number ten. Will President Trump call out Turkey\u2019s relationship with Hamas, the Palestinian organization that continues to terrorize Israel on a daily basis?<\/p> <p>Will he stand by our ally Israel, or will his personal interests and affinity for strongmen win out once again?<\/p> <p>The President says he wants to put \u2018America First.\u2019<\/p> <p>Yet on every one of these ten issues, Trump has cowered to the demands of Ankara and Moscow.<\/p> <p>Look, Trump can meet with Erdogan \u2013 that is his decision and his prerogative.<\/p> <p>But on these and so many other issues, President Trump\u2019s actions do not represent the values of the American people or their representatives here in Congress.<\/p> <p>He does not represent those who support holding Russia accountable.<\/p> <p>He does not represent those who stand against war crimes in Syria.<\/p> <p>He does not represent those who want to see a democratic Turkey.<\/p> <p>Despite our objections, President Trump will welcome Erdogan to the Oval Office.<\/p> <p>But at the same time, it\u2019s worth pointing out that so many months into the controversy surrounding Ukraine, President Trump has yet to set a date for an Oval Office meeting with Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky.<\/p> <p>President Zelensky is a true friend to the United States, on the front lines of the struggle for democracy in his country. He\u2019s standing up to Russian aggression and corruption. He\u2019s respecting the free press. He\u2019s working to strengthen democratic institutions.<\/p> <p>President Zelensky, put simply, everything that President Erdogan of Turkey is not. And yet, it is Turkey that President Trump continues to admire, and Ukraine that he continues to demonize. Something is wrong here, M. President.<\/p> <p>We should not have to cross our fingers and hope that any American President stands up for our values, holds our adversaries accountable, and does the right thing when it matters most.<\/p> <p>It should not be a question. It should be a given. And yet all I can do at this time is hope President Trump will reverse course and challenge bad behavior of an authoritarian like Erdogan rather than celebrate it.<\/p> <p>HOW TURKEY FOULS THE UNITE STATES<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3I7SHAD35OB7GDUYSKVSY36FV11M75"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":404,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"unknown","month":"unknown","date":"unknown","city":"unknown","region":"unknown","country":"Turkey","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Turkey, Hama, Cyprus, Ukraine, Erodgan, Trump, Greece, Hagia Sophia, religious freedom, ethnic cleansing, genocide, Menendez, U.S. Senate, authoritarian, sanctions","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"unknown","month":"unknown","date":"unknown","city":"unknown","region":"unknown","country":"Turkey","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Turkey, Hama, Cyprus, Ukraine, Erodgan, Trump, Greece, Hagia Sophia, religious freedom, ethnic cleansing, genocide, Menendez, U.S. Senate, authoritarian, sanctions","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1001265427,"Input.title":"Xi Jinping Openly Attributes His Genocidal Tyranny To Marxism","Input.publish_date":"2021-08-27 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Anyone who thinks Marxism-Leninism is an incidental factor in the governance of Communist China should read the address of Chinese President Xi Jinping marking the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).<\/p> <p>In a text of some 5,000 words (why do all communist dictators suffer from logorrhea?), Xi asserted the Communist Party and its socialist ideology are primarily responsible for every one of China\u2019s major accomplishments \u2014 including its national rejuvenation, \u201ddauntless spirit,\u201d modernization, and \u201cgreat unity.\u201d Although the Chinese people are accorded a significant role in China\u2019s emergence as a world power, they operate under the leadership of the party. \u201cOnly socialism could save China,\u201d Xi declared, \u201cand only socialism with Chinese characteristics could develop China.\u201d<\/p> <p>Xi\u2019s address is a masterpiece of political cynicism and calculated misinformation. Lenin, the ultimate Machiavellian \u2014 who used every means, including the secret police and forced labor camps, in the pursuit of power \u2014 would have approved. So would Mao Zedong, the founder of the CCP, who summed up his philosophy succinctly: \u201cPolitical power grows out of the barrel of a gun.\u201d<\/p> <p>Missing from Xi\u2019s list of Communist China\u2019s \u201caccomplishments\u201d was Mao\u2019s so-called Great Leap Forward, his heedless experiment in backyard furnaces and agricultural collectivism that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 50 million Chinese. The massive toll of dead did not matter to Mao, the unrepentant communist ideologue, nor to Xi, who lavishly lauded Mao Zedong Thought.<\/p> <p>Xi also did not mention the Tiananmen Square Massacre of June 1989, when tanks and troops of the People\u2019s Liberation Army killed hundreds and quite possibly thousands of pro-democracy students who had occupied the square to call for more political freedom. To this day, most Chinese are ignorant of what happened in Tiananmen Square.<\/p> <p>Genocide against the Uyghurs<\/p> <p>Absent from Xi\u2019s address was any reference to his government\u2019s calculated persecution of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang province in Western China. Both the Trump and Biden administrations\u2019 secretaries of state accused Communist China of practicing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Uyghurs.<\/p> <p>No more serious charge can be made against a regime than that it is engaged, to quote Webster\u2019s, in \u201cthe deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group.\u201d Genocide conjures up the darkest and most disturbing images of places like Nazi Germany.<\/p> <p>Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in January 2021 that China, under the direction and control of the CCP, continues to commit genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. In his Senate confirmation hearings, then-Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken seconded Pompeo.<\/p> <p>In its annual human rights report, the State Department listed these acts:<\/p> <p>Arbitrary imprisonment in reeducation camps of 1 million Uyghur civilians, (2) forced sterilizations, (3) coerced abortions, (4) rape and torture of those imprisoned, (5) forced labor such as the picking of cotton by hand, (6) \u201cdraconian\u201d restrictions on religious freedom, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement.<\/p> <p>In addition to the mass detention of more than one million Uyghurs, an estimated two million Muslims are subjected to daytime \u2018re-education\u2019 training.<\/p> <p>Chinese Communist authorities justify their genocidal actions by referring to three occasions in 2014 when Uyghur militants bombed a market and train stations, one during Xi\u2019s visit to the region, and killed more than 100 people. In retaliation, Xi launched the \u201cPeople\u2019s War on Terror\u201d in Xinjiang province, where Uyghurs constitute almost 90 percent of the population.<\/p> <p>He delivered a series of hardline speeches, declaring that \u201cWe must be as harsh as them and show absolutely no mercy.\u201d He called on the Communist Party to unleash the tools of \u201cdictatorship\u201d to eradicate radical Islam in Xinjiang.<\/p> <p>Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party boss in Xinjiang, got the message. Chen instructed police officers and troops to prepare for a \u201csmashing, obliterating offensive\u201d and issued an open-ended directive: \u201cRound up everyone who should be rounded up.\u201d<\/p> <p>Eradicating the Uyghurs\u2019 Religion and Culture<\/p> <p>Since then, the government, under the direction of the CCP, has carried out a deliberate policy of eradication of the Uyghurs\u2019 Muslim religion and culture. Han Chinese cadres are placed in Uyghur homes as monitors. Uyghurs who engage in \u201cextremist\u201d behavior such as praying, owning religious books, or abstaining from alcohol or tobacco are placed in \u201cre-education camps.\u201d<\/p> <p>Uyghurs in rural areas are required to obtain special cards for travel between towns. Traditional festivals and pilgrimage sites have been closed. Private education in Uyghur language and religion has been criminalized. Police have raided homes in search of forbidden books. Children\u2019s names such as Fatima and Muhammad are banned as too Islamic. More than 100 Uyghur cemeteries have been destroyed. Biometric data is collected of all Xinjiang residents between 12 and 65 years of age.<\/p> <p>Selected Uyghur prisoners are placed in the liuzhi detention system, which operates outside the normal judicial system and is used by the government and the CCP to investigate what they call corruption. Treatment includes prolonged solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, beatings, forced standing or sitting for hours and sometimes days, and sexual harassment.<\/p> <p>The evidence of deliberate genocide is so compelling that even left-wing journals like The New Republic have condemned Communist China\u2019s treatment of the Uyghurs. The journal described the 2 million Uyghurs forced into scattered \u201cgulags\u201d across the region as \u201cthe largest imprisonment \u2014 based not on crimes, but on ethnicity and religion alone \u2014 since the Holocaust.\u201d<\/p> <p>The magazine estimated that Xinjiang has a higher percentage of police density than East Germany, which had more police informants per capita than Nazi Germany. Nowhere in the world, wrote the German weekly Der Spiegel, \u201cis the population monitored as strictly as it is in\u201d Xinjiang.<\/p> <p>Political Prisoners<\/p> <p>In addition to its genocide against the Uyghurs, the PRC routinely violates the human rights of the 1.4 billion Chinese who are not Muslim.<\/p> <p>Dozens of pro-democracy protestors and activists, such as famed publisher Jimmy Lai, have been routinely arrested and jailed. Hundreds of human rights lawyers have been put in jail; many have been arrested and are still unaccounted for. In 2017, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who long spoke forcefully on behalf of freedom and democracy, died in a hospital while under close surveillance by the CCP.<\/p> <p>Thousands of political prisoners, including writers, scholars, activists, pastors, Falun Gong practitioners, Catholic priests, rights lawyers, and bloggers, remain incarcerated. Numerous former political prisoners have reported they were beaten, raped, subjected to electric shock, hung by the wrists, forced to take medication against their will, and subjected to physical and psychological abuse.<\/p> <p>The Ministry of Public Security directly administers 23 psychiatric hospitals for the criminally insane. There have been reports of political activists being subjected to psychiatric treatment.<\/p> <p>Qelbinur Sedik, a former teacher at a women\u2019s internment camp, reported that some 10,000 women had their heads shaved and were forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions. Women were raped and sexually abused daily by camp guards. A torture room in the camp basement was reserved for those who resisted.<\/p> <p>There is no freedom of expression in Communist China. For example, students taking online classes at American universities were imprisoned for criticizing the government, as were university professors critical of Beijing.<\/p> <p>Just how important is control of this freedom was underscored by Xi Jinping\u2019s personal involvement. Xi has visited Chinese media outlets and demanded they pledge their loyalty to him. When blogger Ren Zhiqiang, who had 35 million followers, criticized Xi\u2019s editorial demands, he was shut down.<\/p> <p>Surveillance and the Social Credit System<\/p> <p>Advances in surveillance technology, including artificial intelligence and intrusive surveillance aps, along with police access to user data, have helped facilitate Communist China\u2019s prosecution of dissident leaders, according to Freedom House. The Ministry of Public Security uses tens of millions of surveillance cameras to monitor public events and identify individuals in crowds. The government even installed surveillance cameras in monasteries in the Tibetan Autonomous Region.<\/p> <p>The Chinese government continues to use two kinds of social credit systems. The corporate social credit system tracks corporate wrongdoing. The personal social credit system collects information from a wide variety of sources, including academic records, traffic violations, social media presence, friendships, acceptance of birth-control regulations, employment performance, and consumption habits.<\/p> <p>Destroying Religion<\/p> <p>Freedom of religion is another major concern of the Chinese Communist Party. Xi has expressed a desire to \u201cSinicize\u201d all religions. Accordingly, crosses have been removed from churches, the Bible is being retranslated to find commonalities with Socialism, the Ten Commandments have been replaced with quotes from Xi Jinping, Christian churches have been burned down, and the CCP was caught spying on the Vatican\u2019s computer networks.<\/p> <p>Promoting \u201cChinese Christianity\u201d is the end goal. The Ten Commandments have been replaced with quotes from Xi.<\/p> <p>Communist China continues to take all necessary steps to suppress any sign of true Tibetan autonomy and culture, announcing, for example, that it plans to choose the Dalai Lama\u2019s successor. Two million Tibetans have been forcibly \u201crehoused\u201d to \u201cNew Socialist Villages.\u201d Thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns have been expelled from their monasteries, and Buddhist customs such as meditation have been criminalized. More than 2,000 CCP officials have been sent to Tibetan villages to monitor their behavior.<\/p> <p>The primary instrument of the government\u2019s campaign to suppress human rights is the Communist Party. In his address commemorating the 100th anniversary of the CCP, Xi said that any attempt to separate the party from the Chinese people, or to set the people against the party, \u201cis bound to fail.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said the more than 95 million party members and the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people \u201cwill never allow such a scenario to come to pass.\u201d The ideology that unites the party and the people, he said, is Marxism. \u201cMarxism \u2026 is the very soul of our Party and the banner under which it strives.\u201d<\/p> <p>How the West Must Respond<\/p> <p>What, then, should be the response of the United States and its Western allies to Communist China\u2019s flagrant violation of the most basic human rights of its people? Below are recommendations in a paper by my Heritage colleagues Dean Cheng, Walter Lohman, James Carafano, and Riley Walters.<\/p> <p>The United States should organize and host a summit for democracy and countries commit to defending against authoritarianism and advancing human rights at home and abroad. It should also create a Ministerial on Religious Freedom, modeled after the ministerial pioneered by former Ambassador Sam Brownback, to advance religious freedom in China and around the globe.<\/p> <p>The United States should apply sanctions to those who have violated U.S. intellectual property rights by cyber means.<\/p> <p>The United States should forge closer relationships with Taiwan and India. It should negotiate Free Trade Agreements with Taiwan, Japan, and other key partners in the Indo-Pacific.<\/p> <p>In addition, the United States should apply sanctions to those who have violated U.S. intellectual property rights by cyber means.<\/p> <p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media should strengthen its messaging in countering Beijing\u2019s public opinion warfare.<\/p> <p>Finally, the United States should request the International Olympic Committee to review Communist China\u2019s suitability to host the 2022 Olympics. Given the deadly plight of the Uyghurs, now is not the time for the international community to kowtow to those who would benefit the most from hosting the Olympics: Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party.<\/p> <p>Lee Edwards is the distinguished fellow in conservative thought at the B.

Those convicted have received sentences ranging from five to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.<\/p> <p>In addition to Article 117 of the Criminal Code, Article 331 (\u201cabusing democratic freedoms to infringe the interests of the State\u201d) is another common charge used by authorities to repress its people.<\/p> <p>Among the 23 people who have been charged under Article 331 since the 2015 Criminal Code took effect, 15 have so far been convicted and sentenced to prison terms of between six months and five years. At least nine people were charged under Article 331 in 2018 alone, another five were detained on the same charge in 2019 and nine were charged in 2020.<\/p> <p>Both Article 117 and 331 violate Viet Nam\u2019s international human rights obligations and should be repealed or substantially amended to comply with the rules set out under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Viet Nam is a state party, and other standards. Other laws that unduly restrict freedom of expression should also be repealed or substantially amended, including the vaguely worded and excessively punitive Law on Cybersecurity.<\/p> <p>In its most recent review of Viet Nam in 2019, the UN Human Rights Committee, the body tasked with monitoring the implementation of the ICCPR, stated that Viet Nam\u2019s \u201cdomestic legal framework remains incompatible with the Covenant\u201d and highlighted Articles 117 and 331 of the Criminal Code in addition to the Law on Cybersecurity for their non-compliance with the requirements of the Covenant.<\/p> <p>Big Tech must end complicity in Viet Nam\u2019s censorship regime<\/p> <p>Viet Nam has long maintained strict censorship of the press, yet the expansion of social media in recent years has significantly opened up the space for public debate and the exchange of ideas and opinions among the general public.<\/p> <p>As documented in Amnesty International\u2019s December 2020 report, \u2018Let Us Breathe!\u2019: Censorship and criminalization of online expression in Viet Nam, this technological revolution has led Viet Nam\u2019s censors and security forces to unleash a major crackdown on online expression.<\/p> <p>A large and growing proportion of prisoners of conscience in Viet Nam are imprisoned based on their expression online, with 41% of those recognized by Amnesty International behind bars because of peaceful online speech.<\/p> <p>In addition to imprisoning people based on their social media posts, Vietnamese authorities have increasingly enlisted tech giants Facebook and YouTube to implement censorship on their behalf.<\/p> <p>\u201cWith these impending changes in national leadership, both the Vietnamese authorities and big tech have a chance to reset their approach. They must protect online expression in line with international human rights law and standards,\u201d said Yamini Mishra.<\/p> <p>Longstanding human rights concerns must be addressed<\/p> <p>Viet Nam has a long and pressing list of human rights concerns which require urgent remedial action by the incoming party and government leadership.<\/p> <p>The country still imposes the death penalty and undertakes executions in violation of the right to life. Amnesty International reiterates the organization\u2019s longstanding call for this ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishmentto be abolished in Viet Nam and everywhere.<\/p> <p>Ethnic and religious minorities also continue to face serious discrimination on the basis of their ethnic and religious identities and perceived political beliefs. Violence against women and girls, and in particular intimate partner violence, remains a serious and widespread concern.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn setting policy for the coming five years, the CPV must set its sights on meeting international human rights standards. From the death penalty, to women\u2019s rights, to the arbitrary prosecution of freedom of expression, this is a time to correct course where current policy is causing suffering and injustice,\u201d said Yamini Mishra.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3E9ZFLPWO07FZ9AYPI1Y09CMGONXIS"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1059,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state

Under Hamas control, the Gaza Strip has suffered from rising unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and a sharp contraction of the private sector.<\/p> <p>Since 2017, the Palestinian Authority government in the West Bank \u2013 Judea and Samaria \u2013 has reduced payments for electricity supplied by Israel to the Gaza Strip and cut salaries for its employees, exacerbating the local economic crisis. Since 2014, Egypt\u2019s crackdown on the Gaza Strip\u2019s extensive tunnel smuggling network has exacerbated fuel, construction material, and consumer goods shortages.<\/p> <p>Last year, Palestinian activists took to the streets of the Gaza Strip to protest economic hardship and demand that Hamas provide solutions for soaring unemployment and poverty rates. The protests, held under the banner \u201cWe want to live!,\u201d were brutally suppressed by Hamas\u2019s security forces and militiamen. Hundreds of activists were detained by Hamas, which saw the economic protests as part of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to \u201ccreate instability and anarchy\u201d and undermine its dictatorial regime in the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>One of the organizers of the protests was Sleman Alajoury, a 24-year-old activist and unemployed university graduate from the northern Gaza Strip. Alajoury was detained several times by Hamas for his role in the widespread protests, described as the worst since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip after toppling the government of PA President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.<\/p> <p>On July 4, one year after the protests were crushed by Hamas, Alajoury\u2019s body was discovered inside his home in the Sheikh Zayed suburb in the northern Gaza Strip. His friends and family members said that the young man had committed suicide with a single shot to the head.<\/p> <p>In his last posting on Facebook, a few hours before he took his life, Alajoury wrote that his suicide was aimed at seeking \u201csalvation.\u201d He also wrote that \u201ccomplaining to anyone but God was an act of humiliation.\u201d<\/p> <p>Alajoury\u2019s words are perceived by many Palestinians as implicit criticism of Hamas over its failure to improve living conditions in the Gaza Strip and its ongoing crackdown on young activists campaigning for a better life, democracy and freedom of speech.<\/p> <p>Ramzi Mahmoud Suleiman, a friend of Alajoury, said that Alajoury had suffered greatly under Hamas\u2019s oppressive measures. Suleiman said that Alajoury had been detained by Hamas security forces, who raided his home on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>Another friend, Shaher al-Habbash, revealed that Alajoury was frequently targeted by Hamas because of his political and social activities in the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>\u201cHamas\u2019s Internal Security Force arrested him several times,\u201d al-Habbash said. \u201cThey attacked his family home and humiliated him during his interrogation inside Hamas prisons. They even raided the home during his sister\u2019s wedding; this bothered him a lot.\u201d<\/p> <p>Several other cases of suicide attempts have been recorded there in the past few weeks.<\/p> <p>Instead of addressing the problem, Hamas is now trying to sweep Alajoury\u2019s tragic death under the carpet.<\/p> <p>Some Palestinians who attended his funeral or visited the family home to offer condolences have been detained by Hamas security officers and militiamen.<\/p> <p>Kidnapped by Hamas\u2019 Military Wing<\/p> <p>One Palestinian, Basim Othman, wrote on Facebook that his brother, Fadi, and three other men were \u201ckidnapped\u201d by members of Hamas\u2019s military wing, Ezaddin al-Qassem, after attending the funeral. \u201cOur message is clear: Hamas is a terrorist organization,\u201d Othman wrote. \u201cWe will teach the kidnappers and their families a lesson.\u201d<\/p> <p>Another Palestinian, Ramez Mahmoud, wrote on his Facebook page that he had escaped a kidnap attempt by the Hamas militiamen after the funeral of Alajoury. \u201cI just survived a kidnaping attempt by security forces belonging to Hamas and its military wing,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cThey kidnapped my friend, journalist Yusef Hassan, and others who came to offer condolences to the Alajoury family.\u201d<\/p> <p>A Palestinian human rights group condemned the Hamas crackdown on Alajoury\u2019s friends and other activists and called for a thorough examination into the increased spate of suicides in the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe [Hamas] security services in Gaza arrested at least nine persons in three separate incidents on July 4, 2020, who were attending the funeral of Sleman Alajoury,\u201d the Al-Mezan Center For Human Rights said in a statement.<\/p> <p>\u201cAl-Mezan\u2019s field investigations show that members of the security services in Gaza arrested Ghasan Sadi Musalam, 37, Fadi Mohammed Othman, 38, and Khalil Adib Salim, 33, at around 1:30 pm near Beit Lahia\u2019s cemetery in the northern Gaza Strip, just after they had left Alajoury\u2019s funeral.\u201d<\/p> <p>The human rights group also pointed out that Hamas had arrested two journalists who were covering the funeral. They were identified as Ahmed al-Ras, 35, and Helmi al-Ghoul, 26, and were interrogated about the nature of their work, before being released.<\/p> <p>\u201cFour more persons were arrested after visiting the deceased man\u2019s family to pay their respects,\u201d Al-Mezan revealed.<\/p> <p>\u201cOfficers of the security services traveling in a blue vehicle and a white mini-bus stopped the four men, two of whom were identified as Yousef Khalil Hassan, and Ahmed Awni al-Mahali, and transferred them to the police station, before releasing all four the same day.\u201d<\/p> <p>The human rights group said that some of those detained by Hamas were summoned back for further interrogation in the coming days. \u201cOthers reported being beaten and verbally abused during interrogations surrounding posts they made on social media that called for peaceful assemblies, and their cell phones were confiscated,\u201d the group added.<\/p> <p>\u201cAl-Mezan condemns the incidents and demands a halt to the arbitrary arrests and summons orders that are carried out in violation of due process, and stresses that duty-bearers are obligated, under Palestinian and international law, to promote public liberties and respect human rights, notably freedom of opinion, expression and peaceful assembly.<\/p> <p>\u201cAl-Mezan further affirms that the problem of suicide in Gaza is symptomatic of the rising level of frustration and despair felt among Palestinian inhabitants.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hamas Fears the World Will Wake Up<\/p> <p>Such calls by human rights organizations are dismissed out of hand by Hamas leaders, whose only concern is the iron grip of their power. For Hamas, Palestinians who commit suicide imperil its regime, even \u2014 and perhaps more so \u2014 after their death.<\/p> <p>Why is Hamas chasing Palestinians to cemeteries and to the homes of grieving families? Because its leaders are terrified that the world will wake up to the fact that their ruinous rule is driving young men and women to commit suicide.<\/p> <p>Hamas, after 13 years of criminal negligence, rejects responsibility for the wellbeing of its people. Astoundingly, it continues to succeed in convincing the world that Israel is to blame for the misery of its own people. This convenient and toxic lie enables it to continue receiving money and weapons from its friends in Iran and Hezbollah to tighten its death grip on the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>For Hamas, jihad (holy war), not a decent life for its people, is what matters. Tragically, it seems that young Palestinians in Gaza are getting the message \u2014 loud and clear.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"302U8RURJ1GF9LGUMJD8HWBIMCPNVB"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1622,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other

said the ongoing case was a missing-persons probe.<\/p> <p>But German authorities, who have revealed they have a new suspect in the case, say they believe Madeleine was killed.<\/p> <p>A man currently under investigation has been identified as a convicted child-sex offender who is in prison for offences not connected to the disappearance of Madeleine, reports StokeOnTrentLive.<\/p> <p>Christian Hoppe of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office told German public broadcaster ZDF the suspect, a German citizen, spent numerous years in Portugal and has two previous convictions for 'sexual contact with girls'.<\/p> <p>Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said at the news conference: \"The public prosecutor's office in Braunschweig is investigating a 43-year-old German national on suspicion of murder.<\/p> <p>\"From this you can see that we assume that the girl is dead.\"<\/p> <p>Hans Christian Wolters, a spokesman for the Braunschweig Public Prosecutor's Office, said: \"In connection with the disappearance of the three-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann on May 3, 2007, from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz, in Portugal, the Braunschweig prosecution is investigating against a 43-year-old German on suspicion of murder.<\/p> <p>\"We are assuming that the girl is dead.<\/p> <p>\"With the suspect, we are talking about a sexual predator who has already been convicted of crimes against little girls and he's already serving a long sentence.\"<\/p> <p>Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now<\/p> <p>He said the suspect was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007, where he worked jobs in the gastronomy business, but funded his lifestyle by committing crimes, including thefts in hotel complexes and apartments, as well as drug dealing.<\/p> <p>Mr Wolters added: \"The Braunschweig prosecution is now concerned because before going abroad he last had his residence in Braunschweig.\"<\/p> <p>German newspaper Braunschweiger Zeitung reported the suspect was carrying out a seven-year prison sentence for the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005.<\/p> <p>The newspaper said he was convicted of the offence in Braunschweig district court in December last year.<\/p> <p>German magazine Der Spiegel reported he was extradited from Portugal in 2017 and initially convicted of drug trafficking.<\/p> <p>Madeleine McCann at age three, next to an age-progressed depiction of how she may have looked at age nine.<\/p> <p>Mr Hoppe said German police have not ruled out a sexual motive for the alleged crime against Madeleine, which is being treated as murder by the BKA.<\/p> <p>He added that the suspect may have broken into an apartment in the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz - where Madeleine was on holiday with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, and her twin siblings Sean and Amelie - before spontaneously kidnapping her.<\/p> <p>A BKA appeal said: \"There is reason to assume that there are other persons, apart from the suspect, who have concrete knowledge of the course of the crime and maybe also of the place where the body was left.\"<\/p> <p>The German national is known to have been in and around the area on the Algarve coast at the time Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday.<\/p> <p>A half-hour phone call was made to his Portuguese mobile phone around an hour before Madeleine is believed to have gone missing.<\/p> <p>The suspect has been linked to an early 1980s VW T3 Westfalia camper van - with a white upper body and yellow skirting, registered in Portugal - which was pictured in the Algarve in 2007.<\/p> <p>(Image: PA Wire)<\/p> <p>Scotland Yard said he was driving the vehicle in the Praia da Luz area in the days before Madeleine's disappearance and is believed to have been living in it for days or weeks before and after May 3.<\/p> <p>He has also been linked to a 1993 Jaguar XJR6 with a German number plate seen in Praia da Luz and surrounding areas in 2006 and 2007.<\/p> <p>The day after Madeleine went missing, the suspect had the car re-registered in Germany under someone else's name, although it is believed the vehicle was still in Portugal.<\/p> <p>Both vehicles have been seized by German police, who said there is information to suggest the suspect may have used one of them in an offence.<\/p> <p>The BKA is also appealing for other potential victims to come forward.<\/p> <p>Scotland Yard is launching a joint appeal with the BKA and the Portuguese Policia Judiciaria (PJ), including a \u00a320,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible of Madeleine's disappearance.<\/p> <p>The Met's investigation has identified more than 600 people as potentially significant and were tipped off about the German national, already known to detectives, following a 2017 appeal 10 years after she went missing.<\/p> <p>She vanished shortly before her fourth birthday and would have turned 17 last month.<\/p> <p>German police are treating her disappearance as a murder investigation but the Met's Operation Grange, launched in 2013, has always considered the case a missing person inquiry.<\/p> <p>A statement from Madeleine's parents, read by Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell, said: \"We welcome the appeal today regarding the disappearance of our daughter Madeleine.<\/p> <p>\"We would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine.<\/p> <p>\"All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice.<\/p> <p>\"We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive, but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace.<\/p> <p>\"We will be making no further comment in relation to the appeal today.<\/p> <p>\"We would like to thank the general public for their ongoing support and encourage anyone who has information directly related to the appeal to contact police.\"<\/p> <p>Mr Cranwell told reporters on Wednesday that he was taking the \"really unusual\" step of releasing two mobile phone numbers as part of the appeal.<\/p> <p>The first, (+351) 912 730 680, is believed to have been used by the suspect and received a call from another Portuguese mobile, (+351) 916 510 683, while in the Praia da Luz area, starting at 7.32pm and ending at 8.02pm on the night of May 3 2007.<\/p> <p>Madeleine is believed to have disappeared between 9.10pm and 10pm that evening.<\/p> <p>The caller, who is not thought to have been in the Praia da Luz area, is not being treated as a suspect, but is said to be a 'key witness'.<\/p> <p>\"Any information in relation to these mobile numbers during the spring and summer of 2007 could be critical to this investigation,\" said Mr Cranwell.<\/p> <p>\"Some people will know the man we are describing today, the suspect in our investigation. I'm appealing to you directly.<\/p> <p>\"You may know, you may be aware of some of the things he has done. He may have confided in you about the disappearance of Madeleine.<\/p> <p>\"More than 13 years have passed and your loyalties may have changed.<\/p> <p>\"This individual is in prison and we are conscious that some people may have been concerned about contacting police in the past. Now is the time to come forward.<\/p> <p>\"I'm appealing to you to contact us, or the German authorities or the Portuguese authorities.<\/p> <p>\"I should be very, very clear on this - while this male is a suspect, we retain an open mind as to his involvement.\"<\/p> <p>The suspect is known to have been linked to the Praia da Luz area between 1995 and 2007, with some short spells in Germany, and is described as having a \"transient lifestyle\", living in his camper van for days at a time.<\/p> <p>An appeal on German Crimewatch-style programme XY said he is thought to have worked odd jobs, including as a waiter, but also committed burglaries in hotels and holiday resorts and dealt drugs.<\/p> <p>He was also linked to two houses in Portugal - one between Praia da Luz and Lagos and a second inland, according to the appeal.<\/p> <p>138208672551<\/p> <p>Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen the camper van in or around Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine went missing, or in the days before or weeks after.<\/p> <p>Detectives also want to speak with anyone who saw the van together with the Jaguar, or individually, during the spring and summer of 2007.<\/p> <p>The Operation Grange incident room can be contacted on 0207 321 9251 or operation.grange@met.police.uk.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3CRWSLD91MJE1JMX96CU9PSALQBOMX"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"2303b84d-0115-4284-b9df-e5c53f359001","work_time_in_seconds":774,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing"],"year":"2007","month":"05","date":"03","city":"Praia da Luz","region":"None","country":"Portugal","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Madeliene McCann","victim_keywords":"3 year old British girl, disappeared, assumed dead","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing"],"year":"2007","month":"05","date":"03","city":"Praia da Luz","region":"None","country":"Portugal","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Madeliene McCann","victim_keywords":"3 year old British girl, disappeared, assumed dead","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1006292214,"Input.title":"UN expert likens Belarus to \u2018totalitarian\u2019 states","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Special Rapporteur Anais Marin warns Human Rights Council that Minsk is moving to \u2018purge\u2019 Belarus of all dissent.<\/p> <p>A top UN expert has likened Belarus to \u201ctotalitarian states\u201d, warning that Minsk\u2019s recent grounding of a passenger plane and subsequent arrest of an opposition journalist on board was part of an ongoing effort by officials to \u201cpurge\u201d the country of all dissent.<\/p> <p>Anais Marin, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on the rights situation in the country, told the Human Rights Council on Monday the incident in May \u201cillustrates the desire of authorities to end all forms of dissidence by purging society of elements it considers undesirable\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is a form of purge that recalls those practised by totalitarian states,\u201d she said in a speech at the Geneva-based forum.<\/p> <p>On May 23, Belarusian authorities diverted a Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania and forced it to land in Minsk, which was followed by the arrest of Lukashenko critic Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend.<\/p> <p>Marin added the rights situation was \u201cdeteriorating\u201d in Belarus, which was rocked by months of protests late last year following longtime President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s re-election in an August vote that was widely denounced by his opponents as rigged but handed the 66-year-old a sixth term in office.<\/p> <p>Authorities responded to the demonstrations with a massive crackdown that saw thousands of people arrested and reports of police brutality.

We demand necessary ordinance or legal initiative in this regard immediately,\" the parishad said in the statement.<\/p> <p>During and after the formulation process of the law -- from the draft to its cabinet approval, placing before parliament to the president's approval -- different journalists associations, political parties, the Editors' Council, different local and foreign bodies voiced concern over several sections of the law.<\/p> <p>\"On behalf of the government, several ministers and members of the parliamentary standing committee sat with us and heard our points of concern. But our demands were ignored. Even the speech of the minister concerned while he was placing the bill in parliament and the opinion of the media representatives placed before the standing committee was not taken into consideration,\" said the statement.<\/p> <p>The representative of the media pinpointed the questionable sections of the law and recommended their amendment. Had those recommendations were taken into consideration, today's situation might not have arisen, it said.<\/p> <p>The Editors' Council on September 29, 2018, had given a detail explanation as to why it was concerned over the act.<\/p> <p>In the explanation, the Editors' Council expressed concern over 9 sections (8, 21, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 43 and 53) of the act.<\/p> <p>In trying to make a law prevent crimes through digital devices and provide security in the digital sphere, the act ends up policing media operations and controlling the media contents. Sections 8, 21, 25, 28, 29, 31 and 32 are contradictory to freedom of the press, guaranteed by the constitution, it said.<\/p> <p>These sections will create a scope for controlling people's freedom of speech and expression. For example, section-8 says the law enforcers can request the BTRC to remove information or block it if it deems any information that are published or circulated in digital media undermining unity of the country or part of it, economic activities, security, defence, religious sentiments, or public rules and order, or creates hatred, hostility towards any ethnicity.<\/p> <p>Section-21 says that if any person, through digital media, spreads propaganda or assist it against Liberation War, Spirit of the Liberation War, Father of the Nation, National Anthem, and National Flag, such action will be considered a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-25 says if any person using a website or any digital device deliberately or knowingly spreads any information or data that is attacking or intimidating in nature; or if a person publishes or distributes any information, despite knowing that it is false, to irritate, humiliate, defame or embarrass or to discredit a person, or damages the image and reputation of the state or spreads confusion or with the same purpose publishes or distributes fully or partially distorted information or data despite knowing that it is false, and if any one assists in such actions, then all such actions of the individual will be considered a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-28 states that if a person or group with the intention of hurting or inciting religious values or sentiments intentionally or knowingly publishes or promotes something on a website or in any other electronic format, which hurts religious feelings or religious values, then this act of that person will be a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-31 states that if a person intentionally publishes or broadcasts something on a website or digital format that causes hostility, hatred or animosity between the various classes or communities concerned or destroys communal harmony or causes instability or disorder or deterioration of law and order or if it happens or is about to happen, then it will be a crime.<\/p> <p>Section-32 states that if a person commits or assists in committing any crime under the Official Secrets Act through computer, digital device, computer network, digital network or any other digital means, the person will then be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or a fine not exceeding Tk 25 lakh or both.<\/p> <p>The statement also said the DSA will create an atmosphere of panic and intimidation where journalism, especially investigative journalism, will become virtually impossible.<\/p> <p>This law will create fear among all the users, including media workers, who uses computers and computer networks.<\/p> <p>Section-43 of the act gives the police unlimited powers in terms of entering homes to search them, search offices, search people's bodies and seize everything related to computers, computer networks, servers and digital platforms. The police will be able to arrest any person without a warrant under the powers given by the law. In this case, there is no need to get any kind of approval from any police authorities.<\/p> <p>The statement adds that there is ambiguity in this law and many words have been used which can be misinterpreted and easily used against the media.<\/p> <p>Another concern of the Sampadak Parishad is that out of about 20 sections of the law relating to crime and punishment, 14 are non-bailable, five are bailable and one is negotiable. This has inevitably created an atmosphere of fear, where the normal practice of journalism has become even more risky.<\/p> <p>Those who commit criminal acts on digital platforms must be brought to justice. However, the law needs to be amended immediately to ensure that it is not applied against the media and free-spirited writers, the statement added.<\/p> <p>\"We demand that all the cases filed against journalists under the Digital Security Act [are withdrawn], all journalists and free-spirited writers who have been arrested and imprisoned under the act be released immediately.

Whose interests are they serving?<\/p> <p>The Nigeria that has been set up for failure by these evil restructuring is visibly bleeding to death and is in its death throes on Buhari\u2019s watch.<\/p> <p>*The entire country is burning*.<\/p> <p>The Northeast was already aflame before the coming of Buhari, its peoples rendered as pawns in the power games of the northern elite, who allowed Boko haram to fester as the evil powers of the federal government was lost to them, and the insurgents were seen as ethnic champions, indeed, Buhari protested about the onslaught on Boko haram, and for those who might have paid attention, Gumi\u2019s interventions are merely aping what Buhari used to say, before he gained office in 2015.<\/p> <p>But what used to be confined to the northeast, has today become a pan Nigerian problem.<\/p> <p>The terrorists have crossed into the northwest and as they have ravaged the entire region including the president\u2019s home state, kidnapping hundreds of schoolchildren and their teachers, raping and pillaging the land, the Buhari regime has treated them with kids gloves, and have blithely labeled them as bandits, businessmen, vandals, and even recently as Area Boys.<\/p> <p>Train track bombers, who were clearly intent on the derailment of a passenger train, are labeled as vandals in a clear advertisement of the complicity of the Buhari regime in the terrorist led insurgency, ravaging Nigeria.<\/p> <p>In the Middle belt, what were once episodic outbursts of Fulani herdsmen and farmers conflicts, a conflict as old as man, has acquired a most evil dimension.<\/p> <p>The Buhari that stormed the Government House in Ibadan during the administration of Late Alhaji Lam Adesina, is the one established inside Aso Rock, and the extreme nepotism of the man, his unbridled Islamist irredentism, are not only intact, they are unfettered by any pretense at presidential leadership.<\/p> <p>\u201cBe your brother\u2019s keepers\u201d was Buhari\u2019s response to the slaughter in the Benue debacle, and \u201cgive up your land in order to live\u201d was the spokesman\u2019s recommendation to the victims.<\/p> <p>In the southeast, in the lands of the Igbo people, Gen. Buhari has been most indecorous with his words, but his actions are even worse than his words, and he has effectively lost control of the East.<\/p> <p>The Anambra elections are instructive on several fronts, and I shall return to the subject soon enough, but the facts of the restiveness of the East, is not a fact that might be said to be either in issue, or in dispute, and yes, this is without having factored in the existence of pockets of Fulani terrorists, in parts of Igboland.<\/p> <p>The South-South has been up in arms for a while, and the Niger Delta is essentially a war zone.<\/p> <p>These are the realities of the Niger Delta, where the wealth being evilly dissipated around the length of Nigeria originates, but where all of the Nigerian deprivations are curated.<\/p> <p>The environment is even more violent, rendered so by decades of criminal exploitation of its land and peoples by the Nigerian state, and just as volatile as the hydrocarbons that are being taken from its bowels.<\/p> <p>The Niger Delta is a volcano waiting to erupt, and the PIA is poised to ignite it.<\/p> <p>The southwest, home to the Yoruba people and all men and women of goodwill, whom we have always welcomed, and who have made our lands their homes, have never had it so bad.<\/p> <p>Our hospitality has been violently abused, our generosity of spirit, taken for granted, and the security of lives and properties wickedly undermined.<\/p> <p>Bands of Fulani terrorists are in our forests and farms, they rape, rob, kidnap, and TERRORIZE the people.<\/p> <p>They bear arms brazenly and they act above the law, and when our people respond in self protection, they are victimized by the Nigerian police and the army, which have acted to establish presidential complicity.<\/p> <p>I have pondered Chief Awolowo\u2019s words in his 1981 public letter to Alhaji Shagari, and I have found a part to be metaphysically intriguing, even though it has only served to deepen my alarm, such that I believe that I owe it to posterity to place my fears on the record; \u201cthe ship of state is fast approaching a huge rock and, unless you, as the chief helmsman, quickly rise to the occasion and courageously steer the ship away from its present course, it shall hit the rock, and the inescapable consequence will be an unspeakable disaster such as is rare in the annals of man\u201d.<\/p> <p>Buhari was to be that disastrous rock a few months after the warning.<\/p> <p>The problem with the rock this time, is that the rock is the helmsman of the ship, and he would appear to be DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY steering the ship to its END.<\/p> <p>The Nigeria cobbled together by Decree 24, of 1999, yes, you get it, FRAUDULENTLY known as 1999 Constitution, is built on several lies, and the preservation of these lies, are predicated on several more lies.<\/p> <p>Buhari, is unilaterally imposing another lie, on top of the original lies, and these lies, are what have assured the death of Nigeria.<\/p> <p>The Fulani Islamist agenda of the Buhari regime has found accommodation for each and every one of the public rebuttals of the lies of Nigeria*.<\/p> <p>Confronted with repeated questions about the identity of the sponsors of terrorism, that were discovered by the intelligence services of one of the Gulf Arab countries, and the fact of the convictions of several Nigerian citizens by that country, the Buhari regime, was unequivocal in showing where its preferences and loyalties are;<\/p> <p>\u201cNaming and shaming of suspects is not embarked upon as a policy by the federal Government out of sheer respect for the constitutional rights of Nigerians relating to presumption of innocence.\u201d Abubakar Malami SAN, AGF.<\/p> <p>But it is curious to note, that the same government, is quick to rush to the media, to declare the identities of those that it has declared to be the sponsors of Sunday Igboho, and Nnamdi Kanu., and the greatest victories of the Buhari regime, in its incestuous relationship with corruption, has been won in the media.<\/p> <p>The speed with which it labels voices of dissent as terrorists, whilst ignoring and outrightly colluding with self declared terrorists, renders the Buharist regime a proven accomplice to the terrorist network that is destroying the country.<\/p> <p>Commodore Olawunmi is on record as saying that the security services had submitted a report to General Buhari since 2017, and that a list of the names of the major sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria is one of the several pieces of information in that file.<\/p> <p>He went further to affirm, that several of these positively identified terrorists and terrorist sponsors, are today sitting in the Buharist government at the highest level, and many more are serving senators and governors.<\/p> <p>The fact of Buhari\u2019s terrorists sympathies are too glaring to require any proof beyond the demand that a man should believe the evidence of his own senses.<\/p> <p>The Wall Street Journal in an exclusive piece, REVEALED THAT THE NIGERIAN MILITARY HAS been dealing with terrorists, and in the particular instance, BOUGHT BACK from the terrorists, an ANTI AIRCRAFT GUN, that the terrorists had captured from a unit of the army, because the presence of the piece in the hands of the terrorists, was a direct risk to Buhari himself, who was apparently scheduled for an appointment in his hometown.<\/p> <p>If they knew the location of the terrorists to exchange guns for cash, they most definitely could have bombed the terrorists, instead of paying them off, but how do you bomb \u201cbusinessmen\u201d \u201cbandits\u201d \u201cvandals\u201d?<\/p> <p>The terrorists are called several names but are rarely called what they are.<\/p> <p>Welcome to the land of REPENTANT BANDITS AND VANDALS.<\/p> <p>THE COUNTRY WITH THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DERADICALIZATION in the world.<\/p> <p>I shall not waste any more time to establish the facts of Buhari\u2019s ethno-religious bigotry. He has saved everyone the task of doing that, he happily wears his ethnic and religious supremacist uniforms, and has never pretended to be anything else, but the time has come to state to the whole world as follows.<\/p> <p>*We shall be seeking to persuade our people to avoid being lured into a legitimization of Buhari\u2019s ethnoreligious agenda by engaging with the patently fraudulent lies of any elections in 2023, in the absence of a restoration of peace, and a substantial restructuring of a NEGOTIATED Nigeria.<\/p> <p>*WE ARE NOT ANARCHISTS, WE ARE NOT SECESSIONISTS, we are DEMOCRATS*<\/p> <p>We recognize that there is a democratically elected president in Aso Rock.<\/p> <p>We are not asking for Buhari\u2019s resignation, and since the National Assembly has not seen fit to impeach him, he remains the president of Nigeria until the 27th of May, 2023.<\/p> <p>But it is the considered position of Afenifere that he urgently constitutes a Government Of National Unity, charged with the sole task of seeing to the restructuring of Nigeria, in consultation with the Nigerian peoples.<\/p> <p>The Buhari regime has no plans for any elections in 2023, and this statement is not a difficult proposition to establish, once the parties to the debate, are fully seized, of their faculties.<\/p> <p>Anambra should be useful in ESTABLISHING this obvious fact.<\/p> <p>AS BAD AS THE SECURITY SITUATION IN ANAMBRA MIGHT BE, it is nowhere near as bad as the situation in the NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, or the MIDDLE-BELT, and the rest of Nigeria is hardly at peace.<\/p> <p>By official accounts, outside of the ones that might be deployed to carry their Oga\u2019s briefcases or to hold umbrellas, the Nigerian Police deployed 34K officers to Anambra for the November 6 elections.<\/p> <p>I am not sure if these are in addition to the ones that were already under the state police command, or if these 34K is the totality of the men.<\/p> <p>But it is important to note that these 34K represents approximately 10% of the entire capacity of the Nigerian police, if we are to accept the official numbers without considering the inherent lies that have been told to accommodate the ghosts.<\/p> <p>It is interesting to note, that for every three persons that voted in the Anambra mockery of democracy, there was a policeman, Civil Defence, or military personnel. THE ELECTION HELD, ONLY BECAUSE IT PLEASED IPOB TO CALL A TRUCE.<\/p> <p>In the face of the facts and realities, the Buhari regime has labeled self determination groups as terrorists, gone to extraordinary lengths to abduct MNK, invaded the home of Sunday Igboho and murdered two innocent men in cold blood, chased the same Igboho into Benin Republic, but rolls out the red carpets for terrorists.<\/p> <p>The same Buhari regime had labeled the just and peaceful demands of Omoyele Sowore\u2019s RevolutionNow Movement as terrorist, and judicially curtailed his freedom.<\/p> <p>It is easy to see through the multiple lies of General Buhari if one is minded to look, but the question is, IS ANYONE LOOKING AT US AGAIN?<\/p> <p>The world would appear to be tired of Nigeria, and the preoccupation of the world is fixed on a containment of the nuisance that we have become, because if the world has any care left for us, how has it found the grace of condonement, acquiescence, and obvious complicity?<\/p> <p>How has the cause of liberty been promoted in Nigeria by the British and the Americans? With ALL of their eyes in the Nigerian skies, what did they see on the 20th of October at Lekki.<\/p> <p>The Western world has found accommodation for evil in Nigeria. But if Harold Smith is to be believed, the ruination of Nigeria by the British is not an accident, it is by design.<\/p> <p>Let it be heard loud and clear; Afenifere shall be leading the Yoruba nation to demand substantial restructuring, before any FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS might be held in 2023, and the response of the Buharist regime to these equitable demands for restructuring the country along federalist lines, in order to restore it to its roots and original agreements, shall go a long way in shaping the position of the Yoruba people in the future, but let it be heard loud and clear;<\/p> <p>*NIGERIA IS NOT ONLY NEGOTIABLE, IT IS EVIDENTLY DYING*<\/p> <p>Gen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd) to keep Nigeria one, is it for the Fulani to dominate other ethnic nationalities?<\/p> <p>Gen.

The former Soviet state has been in turmoil ever since President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who has been in power for the past 27 years, claimed a landslide victory despite widespread evidence that the election was neither free nor fair and that opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was the likely winner.<\/p> <p>Before the election results were even announced, tens of thousands of people spontaneously gathered to peacefully protest the conduct of the election and to oppose the Lukashenko regime. The days that followed (9-11 August) were the most violent period in the country\u2019s recent history: up to 7,000 protesters were arrested, many of them beaten and tortured by security forces, with three people dying at the hands of police. Then, between 17 and 18 August, workers across the country took part in strike action to support the democratic protests. Although protests continued until November, and despite international condemnation, Lukashenko refused to concede instead, more than 35,000 people have been arrested over the past year; opposition politicians, trade unionists, journalists, members of civil society, human rights lawyers and protesters have all been targeted with criminal prosecutions, and strict new laws have been introduced to further impede everything from press freedom to freedom of association. Scores of activists have fled the country, and dissents in exile have been kidnapped or found dead.<\/p> <p>Protests, walk-outs and work stoppages from workers at some of Belarus\u2019s biggest heavy industries \u2013 such as Belaruskali, the world\u2019s largest potash (potato fertiliser) producer, and the Minsk Wheeled Tractor Plant (MZKT), where Lukashenko was famously heckled by factory workers \u2013 played a key role in this moment.<\/p> <p>Workers formed strike committees to prepare for a general strike in support of democratic change. Their demands were simple: fresh elections, the release of all political prisoners, an independent investigation into police violence, a guarantee that protesting employees would not be persecuted by employers and state authorities, and an end to the system of short-term job contracts that dominates Belarus\u2019s economy.<\/p> <p>On the one-year anniversary of the start of the protests, Julia Sliuko, a plasterer at Hrodnaprambud, a state-owned construction company in the western city of Grodno (also known as Hrodna), remembers the week that changed everything. Until last year, she says she was apolitical, focusing her energy on raising her 12-year-old son. But that changed last August when she witnessed police beat an unarmed man shortly after the disputed poll. Over the following days Julia spoke to co-workers, many of whom were also beaten by police, about current events. \u201cAfter witnessing this violence, I understood that nothing would be the same anymore. I felt change in the air.\u201d A few days later she would be elected as chairperson of her company\u2019s strike committee and would later stand on stage in front of thousands of Grodno citizens to speak about how the company management tried to suppress the strike: \u201cThey tried to send us on vacation or even suggest money. But we are not for sale. We are with you,\u201d she told the crowd.<\/p> <p>These spontaneous assemblies took place all over Belarus for several days in August, during which time dozens of enterprises saw workers going on strike. \u201cWe hoped that justice would prevail,\u201d says Julia when asked why she and her colleagues went on strike. \u201cWe hoped that law enforcement would not continue to go against the people.\u201d At Belaruskali, for example, which is one of the most successful state-owned companies in Belarus, almost 6,200 of the company\u2019s 17,000 workers supported the idea of post-election strike action (although after coming under significant pressure, only 140 workers actually went on strike). On 10 September, Belaruskali miner and Belarusian Independent Trade Union (BITU) member Yury Korzun chained himself to a piece of mining equipment 305-metres below ground: \u201cI wanted to inspire my colleagues to join the strike. How could I work, when the money we bring to this company goes to law enforcement, who beat peaceful people? To not take action is to put the life of my family at risk,\u201d Yury tells Equal Times.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a strike, it was a revolt\u201d<\/p> <p>President Lukashenko was elected as Belarus\u2019s first post-Soviet president in 1994 and is currently serving his sixth term. Since he took power there has not been a free or fair election, there is no separation of power between the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature, the media is tightly muzzled, and opposition politicians and journalists are routinely jailed. It has become nearly impossible to publicly express political views which oppose Lukashenko\u2019s: since 2019, protest organisers are obliged to provide local authorities with at least 10 days\u2019 notice for any kind of rally; they also have to pay for utilities, medical assistance and police security, with the latter costing up to \u20ac2,500 for an assembly of more than 1,000 people. In a country where the average monthly salary is \u20ac473, this puts legal protests and rallies out of the reach of most working people.<\/p> <p>Organising an authorised strike is just as difficult. \u201cLegally, there is the right to strike, but in reality, it is not feasible,\u201d says Maxim Pazniakou, chairman of the BITU. Before calling a strike, a trade union must have exhausted all possible solutions, such as negotiations with the employer, which have no time limit according to law. For a strike to be legal, it must be backed by over 50 per cent of workers and organisers must approve the strike with several governmental bodies, giving them a minimum of two weeks\u2019 notice. In addition, a strike can be deemed illegal by authorities at any stage. \u201cIn August last year, no one knew how to organise a strike, says Aliaksandar Yarashuk, president of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP). \u201cThe last one happened back in 1995. As a result, most active strikers were at those enterprises where independent trade unions are present. Because only they knew how to organise a strike,\u201d he explains.<\/p> <p>When in August 2020 workers called for strike action in support of the pro-democracy protests, many employers responded by saying that because the workers\u2019 demands were political and nothing to do with pay or working conditions, employers had no obligation to respond to their demands.<\/p> <p>However, as more than 65 per cent of all industrial products in Belarus are produced by fully or partially state-owned enterprises, the potential that workers have to use democratic organisations (trade unions) to advance democratic reform in the political sphere is significant. \u201cWhat happened in August wasn\u2019t a strike, it was more like a revolt. The state took all possibilities from workers to strike legally, but they still have the civil right to do so,\u201d says Yarashuk. In response, the regime cracked down on striking workers with threats, arrests and sackings. For example, Julia from Hrodnaprambud was fired at the beginning of September. Dozens of her co-workers quit in solidarity.<\/p> <p>Most trade union members in Belarus (four million) belong to the state-aligned Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus (FTUB), a relic of the Soviet system complete with the participation of government ministers in the union\u2019s decision-making bodies. About 10,000 workers are currently represented by the independent BKDP. Paradoxically, while in the aftermath of the pro-democracy uprising more and more workers are joining independent unions, these unions are operating in a shrinking space. As outlined in the 2021 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights Index: \u201cSeveral union offices were raided [following the 9 August election], and the police have been forcing unions to hand over personal information about their members, causing serious concern about action against people who have exercised their right to join a union. Union representatives were abducted on their way to work by security services and subjected to interrogation and arbitrary detention. Workers were sentenced to long prison sentences for supporting strike action and protests.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to new labour law amendments, which were brought into force this summer, strikes with political demands are now illegal. It is also forbidden to organise a strike at enterprises where hazardous manufacturing takes place and workers can now be fired for simply calling a strike. At its annual International Labour Conference in June 2020, the International Labour Organization (ILO) strongly criticised the violation of international labour standards taking place in Belarus, calling on the Belarusian authorities to reinstate workers, drop all charges related to participation in protests and to make new amendments to protect workers and trade union activists against discrimination, but Lukashenko\u2019s government rejected the findings and today remains bullish. \u201cWe are running out of means to defend our members,\u201d says Andrei Hanevich, leader of the independent trade union at GrodnoAzot, a chemical state-owned enterprise. \u201cEmployers can do anything they want.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cA modern form of slavery\u201d<\/p> <p>Under Lukashenko, a raft of neoliberal labour laws have been brought in to create flexibility. For example, since 1999, Belarusian labour law has allowed for a maximum employment contract of just five years. As a result, many employers tend to extend contracts from year to year, which means workers have little to no job security and are constantly afraid of losing their jobs. On the other hand, employees cannot leave a job before the end of their contracted term, if an employer doesn\u2018t agree to it. \u201cThis system is one of the reasons why our labour code is one of the worst in Europe. We call it a modern form of slavery,\u201d says Yarashuk.<\/p> <p>Moreover, according to the new amendments it is now legal to fire an individual if they serve an administrative term [editor\u2019s note: in Belarusian law, offenses can be given criminal or administrative punishments, such as a fine or a short jail term]. For example, thousands of people were punished with up to 15 days imprisonment for taking part in demonstrations; under Belarusian labour law this is now treated as the sackable offense of truancy. \u201cLast autumn many workers were fired due to their administrative term. We are suing many such employers because at that time it was illegal,\u201d says Pazniakou. One such worker who got fired this way is the miner Yury Korzun. The day he chained himself underground was his last working day; he later served two 15-day prison terms in a row and in the winter, he spent a further month in prison.<\/p> <p>The majority of people who went on strike were fired from their jobs and many enterprises like GrodnoAzot have refused to extend the contracts of workers active in the protests. \u201cLast year state enterprises fired people not because they were in breach of contract or for being unprofessional, but because they were politically disloyal,\u201d says Yarashuk. The local branch of the BITU tried to initiate negotiations with factory management and persuade them to reinstate (according to the union) illegally fired employees. In July Belarusian media reported that GrodnoAzot need more than 350 workers. \u201cThere is definitely a big lack of staff. It looks like they have a list of people, with whom they will not extend contracts,\u201d says Hanevich.<\/p> <p>The dissolution of independent trade unions?<\/p> <p>Independent trade unions are in a very precarious position in Belarus. Over the past few months authorities have practically destroyed the free media, arresting almost 30 journalists. More than 50 NGOs have been dissolved, among them not only human rights groups, but also charitable organisations. \u201cWe are expecting the dissolution of independent trade unions any moment now,\u201d says Yarashuk. Last month the offices of the Belarusian Radio and Electronic Industry Workers\u2019 Union were raided by the police and its chairperson was forced to leave the country. In addition, Mikola Sharah, the chairperson of the Free Trade Union of Belarus and human rights activist was arrested and detained for three days as a suspect in a criminal case about \u2018damage of property\u2019, resulting in the confiscation of his computers and mobile phones. \u201cRecently our branches in the towns of Polatsk and Pinsk were refused to get registration. The same could happen in [the town of] Bobruisk,\u201d says Sharah.<\/p> <p>Last autumn, hundreds of new members joined the independent trade unions, with \u2013 according to the BKPD \u2013 state trade unions losing about 20 per cent of their members. Some of those workers, like Siarhei Lapunou, joined independent structures instead. Lapunou worked at the state-owned oil refinery Naftan and used to be an FTUB member, but after the election he no longer wanted to support a pro-Lukashenko organisation: the chairperson of the FTUB, Mikhail Orda, managed Lukashenko\u2019s election campaign and the union forced workers to sign for Lukashenko\u2019s candidacy as presidential candidates need to gather at least 100,000 signatures.<\/p> <p>At Naftan, Lapunou says that many members of the independent trade union are discriminated against: they are threatened with dismissal and the deprivation of bonuses if they stay in the \u2018wrong\u2019 trade union.<\/p> <p>\u201cIndependent trade unions are great things, but only when they function in a state of law. In our country, the law doesn\u2018t work any more,\u201d Lapunou laments.<\/p> <p>After protests broke out at state factories Lukashenko visited some of them himself and personally tried to calm down workers. He addressed workers on stage at MZKT, only to be told to \u201cgo away!\u201d by some of the crowd. Of the incident, Yarashuk says: \u201cLukashenko understood that workers are the only force, thanks to which state power can be transferred peacefully. It was big psychological trauma for him at MZKT and we are still experiencing the consequences of this,\u201d he says, citing labour law amendments and the repression faced by independent trade unions, union activists and workers as examples.<\/p> <p>So, with Lukashenko still in power one year later, did the strikes change anything? For Yarashuk, the strikes were successful in weakening Lukashenko\u2019s political position. \u201cHe now knows that almost 70 per cent of the workers don\u2019t trust the authorities.\u201d There are other bright spots, too: some of the workers fired from Belaruskali have been reinstated showing that even in a repressive environment, gains can be achieved through collective action; and fledgling independent trade unions have been formed in the healthcare and education sectors.<\/p> <p>But overall, those who rose up against Lukashenko have paid a heavy price. Many new members of independent unions are under pressure from employers to leave, which keeps member numbers low, and the labour movement has lost many unions at many factories (such as the Minsk Automobile Plant and MZKT) because activists and members were fired since August 2020. Yarashuk is positive that now that the seed of independent trade unions has been planted, at some point they will flourish: \u201cThey can dissolve the unions, but they can\u2019t destroy the idea.\u201d<\/p> <p>In the meantime, many of the strikers have been forced to leave the country. Julia Sliuko went to Poland with her son in October last year to avoid a jail term. She now works as a manicurist and organises protests in the Polish capital of Warsaw. Siarhei Lapunou from Naftan left for Poland two months ago, and together with other strikers, he survives by doing odd jobs. One of his friends, Valery, who also took part in the 2020 strikes, is a father of three children, one of whom has a disability. Although things aren\u2019t easy in Poland, he plans to remain in exile until Lukashenko is gone: \u201cI know we will return to Belarus some day, but I understand that victory may not come soon.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3YCT0L9OMOOZHTZQSO8369RBN8FSNV"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":638,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"August","date":"9.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Belarus, protests, arrests, killing, Lukashenko opposition, union members, human rights, lawyers, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"August","date":"9.0","city":"Minsk","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Belarus, protests, arrests, killing, Lukashenko opposition, union members, human rights, lawyers, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1015490136,"Input.title":"US missionaries say 2 of 17 abductees freed in Haiti","Input.publish_date":"2021-11-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>A manager at the Christian Aid Ministries headquarters, left, speaks with a worker at the door of the center in Titanyen, north of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Nov. 21.

Their Haitian driver also was abducted, according to a local human rights organization.<\/p> <p>The leader of the 400 Mawozo gang has threatened to kill the hostages unless his demands are met. Authorities have said the gang was demanding $1 million per person, although it wasn't immediately clear that included the children in the group.<\/p> <p>The spokesman for Haiti's National Police, Gary Desrosiers, confirmed to The Associated Press that two hostages were released on Sunday.<\/p> <p>The FBI, which is helping Haitian authorities recover the captives, declined to comment.<\/p> <p>The release comes as Haiti struggles with a spike in gang-related violence and kidnappings, with the U.S. government recently urging U.S. citizens to leave Haiti amid deepening insecurity and a severe lack of fuel blamed on gangs blocking gas distribution terminals. On Friday, Canada announced it was pulling all but essential personnel from its embassy.<\/p> <p>The fuel shortage has forced hospitals to turn away patients and paralyzed public transportation, with some schools closing and businesses shortening their work hours.<\/p> <p>Haiti also is trying to recover from the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moise and a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that struck in mid-August, killing more than 2,200 people and destroying tens of thousands of homes.

There was a misunderstanding between Abubakar Shekau camp and that of the son of the late Muhammad Yusuf in March 2015 which gave birth to ISWAP, a Jihadist terrorist organization active in the Lake Chad Basin Areas.<\/p> <p>I came across the name in 2015 when a renowned terrorism reporter and a journalist Ahmed Salkida tweeted on his twitter handle that Boko Haram splinted into major groups. The group at that time seemed to be nonviolent; their modus operandi is like humanitarian workers helping the extreme or poor communities with water, shelter and other basic amenities. The group was doing so to create trust with the host communities and also create avenue of recruiting more young people into their group.<\/p> <p>The group is reported to have a strong allegiance with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The group appears to be working hard to gain more favour and support from ISIS, though they do provide training and technical assistance to them.<\/p> <p>Recently, the group executed four aid workers who were abducted on 18 July 2019 in Damasak in Borno State. They are in custody of the one woman among the aid workers and some other people including the lecturers from Adamawa. The group is kidnapping people and demanding for ransom which is one of its sources of finance.<\/p> <p>In November, Nigerian Air Force successfully targeted the senior members of the group and killed several of them in Jubilaram in the Lake Chad Basin. The operation, according to Air force spokesperson was part of the renewed offensive to end the protracted insurgency in the region.<\/p> <p>The renew attacks are very disturbing and came at a time the government is claiming that the group has been defeated technically. This month, the group has made several attacks at different locations in Borno and Yobe States. The group reported that they ambushed travellers along Maiduguri-Monguno road where six people were killed, an eye witness said four of them were humanitarian workers. Another one was in Damaturu where the Nigerian army successfully pushed them back and killed many of them. After they left Damaturu, they were also sighted along Miringa axis of Biu firing gun at communities. At last, to the credit of our gallant troops, they were pushed back.<\/p> <p>The major concern is that, ISWAP is growing in power and influence especially in its territorial base on the banks and Island of Lake Chad areas. The group has cultivated a level of support among local civilians. International Security Sector Advisory Team (ISSAT) reported that there is strong bond between ISWAP and these neglected communities and the terrorist group does provide economic support to them and treating them better than parent organization (Boko Haram) and by filling gaps in governance and service delivery. Filling this gap in governance and service delivery is very essential in winning this war and of course getting information from the communities that will help in tackling the conflict.<\/p> <p>ISWAP approach appears to have paid dividends in term of recruitment and support from the communities, displacing them will not be easy because they close to the population especially those communities of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The group reportedly extends micro-loans to local communities especially to women, youths and farmers. The government should not use force alone in fighting them; non-kinetic approach should also be considered to weaken their ties with those communities.<\/p> <p>For Nigeria to win this war, one step to start is to address the issue of human right abuses committed by security personnel and conduct themselves more professionally in discharging their duties in the affected communities. This will win the heart of rural communities to provide the necessary information needed to counter ISWAP terrorists in the region.<\/p> <p>Idris Mohammed, Abuja<\/p> <p>Share this: Facebook<\/p> <p>Reddit<\/p> <p>Twitter<\/p> <p>Print<\/p> <p>Pinterest<\/p> <p>Email<\/p> <p>WhatsApp<\/p> <p>Skype<\/p> <p>LinkedIn<\/p> <p>Tumblr<\/p> <p>Pocket<\/p> <p>Telegram<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"36KM3FWE3TRADZNR3F8U06Z2S0U70D"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":175,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing"],"year":"2019","month":"July","date":"18.0","city":"Damasak","region":"Borno","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"aid workers, educators, Nigeria, Boko Haram","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing"],"year":"2019","month":"July","date":"18.0","city":"Damasak","region":"Borno","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"aid workers, educators, Nigeria, Boko Haram","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":904247144,"Input.title":"Amnesty International slams Nigerian govt failing to address tortures, extra-judicualial killings of citizens","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Amnesty International Nigeria (AIN) has slammed the federal government for failing to investigate and address various rights violations in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Addressing a press conference in Calabar, the Cross River State capital on Thursday, the AIN Researcher and Media Manager, Damian Ugwu and Isa Sanusi, respectively, regretted federal government\u2019s actions when it comes to addressing and investigation of right violations.<\/p> <p>The duo said, \u201cWe started in June 1967 during the days of the civil war, Buhari was a beneficiary of the Amnesty International\u2019s activities when he was arrested and held under house arrest after coup of 1984.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe wrote to the Federal Government, then, the Military Government to tell them that they should respect the right of President Buhari and allow him the freedom to leave his normal life, Obasanjo and many others were declared prisoners of conscience, we fought for them and now they are politicians who are fighting us.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey are fighting against what they have benefited, fighting against human right, it will not discourage us or stop us, power is transience, those in power today, one day they will be nothing, no one will even be talking about them but freedom and Amnesty International will be there and people will continue to fight them.<\/p> <p>In 2017 December, Nigerian government signed anti torture Act, which makes it criminal to torture detainees, up till now, no Police officer has been placed on trial, while we know that torture is still going on, we want to see people brought to book for violating human rights, we want to see people go to jail for torture, extra judicial execution and ill treatment and killings,\u201d the duo stated.<\/p> <p>\u201cFor instance, in 2016, May 13, we documented the killing of Biafrian activist in South East Nigeria, the government promised to investigate, up till now, nobody has been brought to book, in 2014, March 14, we are talking about Giwa Barracks massacre, where 640 people were killed in a day, in Maiduguri.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe documented in one of our reports and government promised to investigate, up till now, we are not aware of anybody who has been sanctioned because of that and so many violations.<\/p> <p>\u201cBetween 2016 and now, we have written two reports about SARs and we have noted the brutality and impunity that go on at several stations like SARs in Anambra State and other stations and torture of innocent citizens, which Police promised to investigate up till now, no Police officer has been brought to book on account of torture.<\/p> <p>Consequently, on Boko Haram, the AIN said, \u201cSince beginning of Boko Haram, we have done so many reports.

We\u2019re going to be discussing the Pegasus Scandal.<\/p> <p>I make an effort to avoid the news for mental health reasons, but given my profession, I couldn\u2019t escape the news of this story. It was trending on news sites around the world.<\/p> <p>Despite the popularity of this story, I have found it difficult to find a simple and thorough explanation of the details of the Pegasus Scandal. Which is why I\u2019m writing to you today.<\/p> <p>In this post, I\u2019m going to cover everything you need to know about this incident in terms that are easy to understand, even if you don\u2019t know much about tech. I\u2019ll also be going into a bit of history on this issue as well as the picture it paints for our future.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the facts you need to know first.<\/p> <p>The Pegasus Scandal: The basics<\/p> <p>For the first half of this article, I\u2019m just going to cover the critical facts of this story. If you don\u2019t know anything about this scandal, this is a good place to start.<\/p> <p>What is the Pegasus Scandal?<\/p> <p>The Pegasus Scandal is the name being given to one of the scariest cybersecurity breaches of our time. \u201cPegasus\u201d is the name of malware developed by a group known as \u201cNSO\u201d.<\/p> <p>Pegasus is capable of infecting any major smartphone device of today. That includes the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 as well as most Android smartphones.<\/p> <p>Once a device has been infected, Pegasus gains access to root permissions for that device. For those that don\u2019t know, root permissions refer to deep administrative control of a device. That includes cameras, microphones, messaging apps, emails, photos and videos, phone calls, contacts, calendars, and GPS data.<\/p> <p>In other words, root permissions give software access to everything. Ideally, the only software on your iPhone that has access to root permissions is iOS itself. And the only person who can act on those permissions is you and (on rare occasions like iPhone repairs) Apple.<\/p> <p>In this case, though, Pegasus was able to access and use (and did use) all of these root permissions to spy on users.<\/p> <p>I normally try to avoid negativity, but it can\u2019t get too much more serious than this. Imagine all of your worst fears about being spied on by your device, and that\u2019s basically what Pegasus has been able to accomplish.<\/p> <p>Did Apple, Google, and others intentionally participate in the Pegasus Scandal?<\/p> <p>No, Apple, Google, and other device manufacturers did not knowingly participate in the Pegasus Scandal. At least not as far as we know.<\/p> <p>Based on the best investigative journalism being conducted at this time, it doesn\u2019t look like any of these major tech companies had anything to do with this. If anything, these companies have been completely turned upside down by this news.<\/p> <p>Hopefully, the engineers at these businesses are working night and day to stop Pegasus in its tracks as well as prevent future attacks like it.<\/p> <p>Not only did Apple and others not participate in this, but Apple has made statements disavowing these attacks and asserting that the iPhone is still the most secure mobile device on the market.<\/p> <p>To be fair, the iPhone probably is still the most secure smartphone out there. But as we\u2019ve learned, that might not be enough anymore. I\u2019ll get into this further in the article.<\/p> <p>Who is at risk?<\/p> <p>The one inkling of good news surrounding the Pegasus Scandal (aside from the fact that the story broke at all) is that you probably aren\u2019t at risk. This software was developed for government use, which means that it\u2019s primarily targeting individuals in positions of political power.<\/p> <p>You should be personally concerned about the effects of Pegasus (regardless of nationality) if you:<\/p> <p>Hold a political office<\/p> <p>Are a journalist (especially a political one)<\/p> <p>Hold political influence<\/p> <p>Are a member of a military<\/p> <p>Work for a government (especially with access to sensitive information or permissions)<\/p> <p>The data that was uncovered and leaked by the journalists who investigated this story (I\u2019ll go into more detail on them later) shows roughly 50,000 individuals who were affected by this scandal.<\/p> <p>To give you an idea of the severity of the individuals targeted, French President Emmanuel Macron was successfully targeted by Pegasus. He has since changed his phone.<\/p> <p>You are probably safe<\/p> <p>For now, this seems to indicate that the vast majority of people around the world are safe from Pegasus software. I\u2019m sure that more than 50,000 people were affected. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be an indication of mass civilian surveillance in this specific case.<\/p> <p>That said, I would not advise you to relax and forget this story altogether. Although you most likely haven\u2019t been affected, the ramifications of this could certainly have an impact on your life.<\/p> <p>This software (or another like it) could at a later point in history be deployed at the civilian level en masse. Or one of your political leaders could be targeted, which could impact your national security.<\/p> <p>Either way, this is big news for everyone around the world. Pegasus is a few years ahead of leading cybersecurity defenses. Until we catch up, this attack and others like it pose a serious threat.<\/p> <p>You probably won\u2019t know if your device is infected<\/p> <p>One of the most concerning aspects of the Pegasus Scandal is how difficult it is to learn who is and isn\u2019t infected. Journalists were able to provide a list of affected parties by finding and leaking lists of targets over time. However, they were not able to find a way to detect Pegasus malware on a person\u2019s device.<\/p> <p>In other words, we have an idea of who was infected because lists of names have been uncovered. This scandal was not exposed, however, by finding the malware on mobile devices.<\/p> <p>An example that counters this is the Silver Sparrow malware, which was found oppositely. We were able to find it on Mac devices, but it was never discovered where it came from or why it was used.<\/p> <p>For now, there is little to no way to confirm or deny the presence of Pegasus on your device. Again, it is extremely unlikely that your device has been affected. If you have reason to believe you may be at risk, though (i.e., you\u2019re a member of one of the targeted groups I covered earlier) then it might be worth purchasing a new iPhone and getting rid of your current device completely.<\/p> <p>How the Pegasus malware works<\/p> <p>Pegasus malware is what\u2019s known as a \u201czero-click\u201d attack. That means that the user of the targeted device doesn\u2019t have to do anything to be infected. It can compromise your device without any malicious links, popups, or other deceptive methods. It\u2019s simply sent to a device, and shortly after, the device is infected.<\/p> <p>From what we know so far, it looks like Pegasus is sent to devices one of two ways.<\/p> <p>The first is by sending a link to the user via email, text message, or instant messaging (i.e., WhatsApp). Once the user clicks on the link, the infection process begins. In this instance, the attack would not technically be \u201czero-click\u201d.<\/p> <p>The second method uses vulnerabilities in common apps. This includes both common third-party apps (like WhatsApp) as well as built-in apps like Apple Music and Photos. While specific details haven\u2019t been uncovered (or released to the public), it was discovered that suspicious activity occurred in both Apple Music and Photos shortly before Pegasus was able to infect the system.<\/p> <p>How zero-day vulnerabilities work<\/p> <p>It is believed that Pegasus was able to infect iPhones through built-in iOS apps by looking for \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities. A zero-day vulnerability is when a hacker starts brute-forcing different attacks on software as soon as it\u2019s released. That way, the hacker can find a vulnerability before the developer can and exploit it.<\/p> <p>Put simply, when Apple releases a new version of iOS (even an incremental update like iOS 14.7) there is almost always an unforeseen vulnerability. After a few days or weeks, that vulnerability will be uncovered, and before any hackers can exploit it, Apple will release a new update that removes this vulnerability. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll sometimes get back-to-back iOS updates.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, there are some groups (including Pegasus\u2019s developer NSO) who have the resources and motivations to uncover a vulnerability on the same day that the software is released.<\/p> <p>So they find the vulnerability, modify Pegasus to exploit that vulnerability, then send Pegasus to the victim. By the time Apple finds and patches the vulnerability, the device is already infected, so the patch is ineffective for that user and other victims.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that most of the vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s software are inevitable. In the same way that it\u2019s impossible to build a pick-proof lock, there is no way for Apple to release a version of iOS that is completely unhackable.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s why iPhone is considered the \u201cmost secure\u201d and not the \u201ccompletely secure\u201d smartphone. So Apple and co are deserving of a modicum of lenience along with the (appropriately directed) criticism.<\/p> <p>Some background on Pegasus developer NSO<\/p> <p>Those are all of the details that you need to know. Now we\u2019re going to get into some finer points as well as discussions on the impact of the Pegasus Scandal. First, let\u2019s explore NSO.<\/p> <p>As mentioned, NSO is the group that developed the Pegasus malware. They\u2019re based in Israel and have been working on tech like this since the 2010s, which is right around the time that smartphones shifted from a novelty to a necessity.<\/p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the recent story on Pegasus is not the first time that NSO has gotten into hot water. Its entire history is filled with controversy and, arguably, crime. Here are some of the \u201csmaller\u201d issues surrounding NSO:<\/p> <p>In 2012, the Mexican government hired NSO to help it keep tabs on journalists and human rights activists in Mexico (source)<\/p> <p>In 2018, NSO was accused of helping the Saudi Arabian government spy on human rights group Amnesty International (source)<\/p> <p>Despite NSO\u2019s Pegasus malware being intended exclusively for use by governments, one of NSO\u2019s staff attempted to sell the software online in exchange for cryptocurrency, highlighting the possibility of Pegasus falling into the wrong hands (of course, it\u2019s debatable whether or not there even are \u201cright hands\u201d for Pegasus to fall into) (source)<\/p> <p>Other scandals have followed NSO<\/p> <p>Larger scandals have plagued NSO, too. It has been sued by Facebook-owned WhatsApp for injecting its spyware on the devices of WhatsApp users via the WhatsApp platform (source). The alleged attack affected 1,400 users across 20 countries.<\/p> <p>Among those users were (you guessed it) numerous journalists and human rights defenders. WhatsApp also claimed to have discovered that these attacks originated from NSO servers. If true, that would seem to indicate that NSO directly used Pegasus to infect these users, not one of NSO\u2019s clients\/customers.<\/p> <p>It is also alleged that the Pegasus software was used to track Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi Arabian government in the months preceding his murder (source). For everyone who remembers, this was an internationally devastating crime. Seeing Pegasus linked to it is no small matter.<\/p> <p>In short, NSO has been developing the Pegasus surveillance software for the Israeli government over the last decade. The software hasn\u2019t just been used by Israel, however. The Israeli government has been licensing the software to other governments, who have largely been using it to stifle and remove journalists, activists, and human rights defenders.<\/p> <p>Put another way, NSO appears to be, by all accounts, a perpetrator of dystopian tactics. This may be its biggest scandal yet, but it is by no means an outlier in the group\u2019s history.<\/p> <p>NSO is refuting claims about its Pegasus software<\/p> <p>To nobody\u2019s surprise, NSO is refuting the claims surrounding the Pegasus Scandal.<\/p> <p>Which claims is it refuting? Specifics haven\u2019t been named. The group\u2019s lawyers have simply disavowed the ramifications of its software without discussing specific allegations.<\/p> <p>All NSO\u2019s lawyers have said so far is that the claims made by the journalists who uncovered and leaked this information are \u201ca compilation of speculative and baseless assumptions.\u201d<\/p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that when faced with the allegations surrounding WhatsApp, all NSO had to say was that, \u201cNSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients.\u201d In other words, all it had to say on the matter was that what its customers do with its software isn\u2019t its business.<\/p> <p>So it looks like NSO is sticking with the tried-and-true \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, and even if I did, it\u2019s not my fault\u201d defense.<\/p> <p>Apple\u2019s security and privacy claims have forever been called into question<\/p> <p>I mentioned earlier that I think Apple, Google, and others deserve a bit of leniency when it comes to these sorts of attacks. After all, they are, to a certain extent, inevitable.<\/p> <p>Apple doesn\u2019t have the power to stop global government-funded organizations from wedging surveillance malware through iOS updates. If Apple could create a hack-proof version of iOS, I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve done it already.<\/p> <p>That said, I would not argue that Apple and company are exempt from criticism. I\u2019ve been covering privacy on AppleToolBox and other websites for a long time because it\u2019s arguably the most important challenge facing tech today. And for a long time, Apple has been the best mainstream tech company at preventing these kinds of scandals.<\/p> <p>Seeing how effective and widespread the Pegasus Scandal is brings new points into the privacy discussion.<\/p> <p>First, to what extent is Apple responsible? Should it change the way it manufactures its devices and software, and if so, how?<\/p> <p>Second, it\u2019s safe to say that for all of Apple\u2019s best efforts and marketing slogans, your iPhone isn\u2019t bulletproof. The only way to truly avoid surveillance is to remain a nobody and\/or live isolated from modern technology.<\/p> <p>Third, it highlights how unerringly important it is for political officials to wake up and get educated on cybersecurity and tech issues. While some promising progress is beginning to happen (read here), it\u2019s too slow. New regulations, innovations, and defenses at the administrative level are needed to help stave off the growing threat of cyberattacks.<\/p> <p>The origin of groups like the NSO<\/p> <p>The NSO seems to be the most pressing threat to our digital security and privacy for at least the last ten years. It\u2019s too much power in too many hands, all of which seem to be the worst hands available.<\/p> <p>In the same way that the U.S. government deserves criticism when it sells weapons to bad actors, the Israeli government should be held accountable for where and how Pegasus is distributed, assuming it should even be allowed to be distributed, to begin with.<\/p> <p>Of course, the Pegasus Scandal is not the first of its kind. Intel and security scandals have plagued the U.S. for the last 50+ years as groups like the FBI, NSA, and CIA have used similar tactics and strategies to target the same groups as Pegasus \u2013 rights activists and journalists.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to think that the origin of groups like NSO began with inspiration from the spying being conducted by the U.S. and U.K. governments. Both countries were shown to be bad actors on this front thanks to the information leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.<\/p> <p>While many of the programs that were unmasked by Edward Snowden have been (at least \u201cofficially\u201d) shutdown, the 2013 leak no doubt inspired countries like Israel and groups like NSO to pursue their ends in this area.<\/p> <p>Similar to how the development of the atom bomb was shortly copied by every other country with the resources to do so, I imagine that there are lots of Pegasus clones that are copying the previous work of the U.S. government.<\/p> <p>How the Pegasus Scandal was uncovered<\/p> <p>The work done to bring the Pegasus Scandal to light is pretty fascinating. It\u2019s certainly one of the most sophisticated instances of investigative journalism that I\u2019ve ever heard of.<\/p> <p>Following the leak of 50,000 phone numbers in 2020 (which were tied to Pegasus), seventeen media publications joined together to investigate NSO and its software. Among these publications are The Guardian, The Washington Post, Le Monde, Proceso, and The Wire.<\/p> <p>In total, 80 journalists from these publications investigated this leak for several months. During that time, these journalists partnered with other investigative and forensic services to identify the phone numbers, search through the devices for malware (when possible), and confirmed that the devices were not only being tracked but being tracked by NSO\u2019s software.<\/p> <p>High-profile individuals from around the world have been targeted, including the President of France Emmanuel Macron, the Prime Minister of Egypt Mostafa Madbouly, and Barham Salih, the President of Iraq.<\/p> <p>As mentioned, a majority of the targeted individuals are journalists and human rights activists. Alongside the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, there are ties between Pegasus and the imprisonment and torture of Saudi women\u2019s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, the assassination of Mexican anti-corruption journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto, and the leaking of intimate photos of Fatima Movlamli (she was 18 at the time that the photos were leaked), an opposer to local authoritarian rule in Azerbaijan.<\/p> <p>The work completed by these journalists is equal parts inspiringly brave and devastatingly eye-opening.<\/p> <p>The future of security and privacy in tech is looking bleak once more<\/p> <p>For the majority of the 2010s, it was generally accepted that our tech was being used to spy on us. This was confirmed by Edward Snowden\u2019s leak in 2013.<\/p> <p>After that leak, however, it seemed that things were steadily improving. Apple and others have taken strong stances on protecting their users\u2019 privacy, and despite cynicism, it has seemed that these companies had put their money where their mouth was.<\/p> <p>Additionally, the U.S. appears to have canceled its previous spying programs, and recent court cases have deemed that the NSA\u2019s surveillance was illegal and potentially unconstitutional.<\/p> <p>But the Pegasus Scandal seems to show that good intentions in one area do not equal good intentions in all areas. The reformation of some bad actors is not equal to the reformation of all bad actors. And it seems like, at least with the state of the world today, that there is little anyone can do about this.<\/p> <p>After all of the journalism conducted on this scandal, it has remained conclusive that if someone wants to use the Pegasus software against you, there isn\u2019t anything you can do to stop them short of isolating yourself from tech.<\/p> <p>The NSO\u2019s excuse for creating and licensing Pegasus<\/p> <p>According to NSO, the Pegasus software is only meant to be used against terrorist organizations. NSO claims that it vets potential governments before licensing the software to them to reduce the chances that they will use it for ill purposes.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s hard to believe, though, given that the software was licensed to known bad actors in the Middle East, to the Mexican government (which has a long history of being adversarial to activists), and others. And regardless of NSO\u2019s intentions, the software has been used for evil.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to put a positive spin on this story. It seems that, once again, those in positions of power have crafted tools of abuse from the opportunities and resources that power presents. It\u2019s a solemn reminder that the ultimate goal of governments is to collect and maintain power at all costs and in all forms. And it\u2019s a reminder to citizens to stay vigilant, strong-willed, and sharp.<\/p> <p>Interested in more stories like the Pegasus Scandal?<\/p> <p>Subscribe to the AppleToolBox newsletter to keep

But since October 2017, attacks in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado \u2013 believed to be exacerbated by contestation over these resources \u2013 have morphed into extremism in a region with fertile conditions for it to thrive. As a result, a humanitarian crisis has reared its head.<\/p> <p>Oil deposits, liquefied natural gas fields and gemstones, projected in 2010 to be worth billions, have culminated in a shift in the political and social climate in neglected Cabo Delgado. Extremist insurgents, which some have claimed are linked to Islamic State, are operating with a sophistication and weaponry that have not previously been seen in the country. Their exact demands and political and economic ideology are currently unknown. Some have argued that there is no evidence of a direct link to Islamic State and that this narrative is being driven by the Mozambican state and the multinationals, because it is likely to bolster powerful external forces to mobilise against the insurgency.<\/p> <p>According to the United Nations, more than 300 000 people have been displaced, while more than 2 000 civilians have been killed. Experts say the violence, which has left villages abandoned as many flee to safety, cannot solely be linked to the Islamic State.<\/p> <p>Zenaida Machado, Angola and Mozambique researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, says the needs of the people living in the affected areas must be prioritised over profit. \u201cThe richest resource that Mozambique has is not the gas, oil or rubies, it\u2019s the people. There is no point in defending multinationals and all the wealth that they are bringing when those villages will be completely abandoned either because the residents have died, or because they ran away,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Cabo Delgado, like the rest of the country, has a high unemployment rate. There were a number of young artisanal miners working in the area before multinational corporations swooped in. Youths who needed jobs were kicked out and became vulnerable to the insurgency, and the external drive to make them join it has grown since.<\/p> <p>Bitter fruits of discontent<\/p> <p>Machado says the insurgents are able to operate in the province because they are able to exploit local political discontent. \u201cWhen people find themselves hopeless, with no one to help them and nowhere to hide, there is the idea of if you can\u2019t beat them, rather join them. And there is also the kidnapping element, where young men and young boys are kidnapped to join the insurgents. We had a situation of young men being massacred a few months back for refusing to join,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>If anything has been done to protect the people living in the affected areas, it has not yet been felt or seen. People are afraid of sleeping in their homes, opting to spend nights in the bush so that they can spot imminent danger, flee and escape. \u201cFamilies are having to walk long distances to get to accommodation\u2026 People are running away from the violence and seeking refuge in Covid-19 hotspots because those are the only safe areas for them to be,\u201d said Machado.<\/p> <p>\u00c9nio Viegas Filipe Chingotuane, head of the department of peace and security at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Maputo, says no single theory can meaningfully explain the origin of Cabo Delgado\u2019s violent extremism. \u201cOnly a mixed explanation can bring us close to the real motives, causes and reason for the uprising,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Chingotuane says Mozambique is a fragile state from every point of view and there are many factors that lure extremists, particularly in the marginalised Cabo Delgado, which he says can be called \u201can ungoverned territory\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is the poorest province with high unemployment, and no fair share of the wealth because of greed and corruption. The revenue is directed to things that aren\u2019t a priority, crippled further by a weak judicial system and a partisan security force\u2026 There is a need to save lives. They [the government] are doing certain things right, but there is a lot which is kept secret and this makes it difficult to assess what they are doing\u201d says Machado.<\/p> <p>Machado adds that if the government had the ability to handle the insurgency, it would not have struck deals with multinational corporations. \u201cThe level of destruction that this group [of insurgents] has created without us knowing who they are? I don\u2019t want to see what they will do once we know who they are\u2026 Right now it\u2019s about proving their strength.\u201d<\/p> <p>The role of multinationals<\/p> <p>Many have contested the view that multinational corporations should be approached for solutions as they are largely seen as part of the problem. The Mozambican government and French energy giant, Total recently signed the biggest energy deal in Africa, worth billions of dollars. Total has clinched the largest share in the deal\u2019s liquefaction projects, but there is interest from other partners too.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy concern with Total is that all that discussion about security never discusses people, it always discusses the infrastructure, the staff of the multinationals, the expatriates,\u201d said Machado. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t discuss the locals and I find it very unfair, disgusting and inhumane that people who have lived in those areas for decades now are forced to run away because gas has been \u2018discovered\u2019. Or [they] see themselves ignored because the priority is not to defend them, it\u2019s to defend the multinationals and the infrastructure of the big investments that are there.\u201d<\/p> <p>The American multinational ExxonMobil and the Italian oil and gas company Eni SpA, which are also investing in the country, are in talks with the Mozambican government to protect their workers while monitoring the situation.<\/p> <p>Chingotuane says eight main districts in the northern region have been affected, namely Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, Palma, Nangade, Muidumbe, Macomia, Meluco, Quissanga and Ibo. Traumatised locals flee to safety and refuge in districts with semi-guaranteed security such as Pemba, Metuge, Mueda, Montepuez and others. On 13 October, Minister of Health Armindo Tiago announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19, and although infection numbers stand at just more than 10 000 in the country, Pemba is known to be a virus hotspot.<\/p> <p>The port in Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, a strategic logistical location, was taken over for the third time in mid-August by a group of insurgents. This led to a disruption in the heavily foreign-backed project as the port is used to transport building materials, oil and gas equipment.<\/p> <p>Although a security force contingency has been sent to deal with the insurgency and regain the port, it remains to be seen if the state can contain it as it is understaffed, underequipped and underfinanced. Chingotuane argues that the state has no ability to handle the insurgency on its own.<\/p> <p>\u201cMozambican security forces are in a bad shape due to many years of low funding and neglect. None of its arms is up to the task in Cabo Delgado. The air force is almost nonexistent, the navy is far from its military capacity and the army is [struggling] to maintain its functionality and execute its mission. The cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineering and communications are all badly affected by poor financing. Problems also involve strategy, doctrine, logistics, training and military exercises,\u201d said Chingotuane.<\/p> <p>Government response<\/p> <p>On Sunday 4 October, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said he would continue strengthening the military intervention capacity of the defence and security forces so that they can respond \u201cmore effectively to terrorist attacks\u201d.<\/p> <p>He was speaking at Pra\u00e7a dos Her\u00f3is (Heroes\u2019 Square) in Maputo, incidentally on the same day that the country celebrated its Peace and National Reconciliation Day. The holiday marks the end of the 15-year civil war between ruling party Frelimo and rebel group turned political movement, Renamo, with an agreement signed in Rome in 1992.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe strongly condemn these acts and reiterate that, as a state, we will continue to use all the resources at our disposal to guarantee public order and security, because the Mozambican people deserve to have a country at peace,\u201d said Nyusi.<\/p> <p>On 29 September, Nyusi was named the 2020 \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d by Africa Oil & Power, an investment platform for the energy sector. The accolade goes to people who supposedly display \u201ctrue leadership and innovative thinking in steering their countries \u2026 to the forefront of the global energy sector\u201d.<\/p> <p>Also in September, Reuters reported that Mozambique approached the European Union for help and support in training local security forces to counter the recurring wave of attacks. This is a different strategy from the initial denial, dismissal and downplaying of the attacks as criminal activity.<\/p> <p>Security forces\u2019 role<\/p> <p>Machado says the security forces behaving in hostile ways towards suspects, who could be innocent, breeds anger and resentment among the population. \u201cWe have documented in the past cases where security forces arrived in a village following an attack and rounded up people. Any person that was seen running away, carrying machetes or [who was] still physically okay in a place of chaos was seen as a suspect.\u201d<\/p> <p>In 2019, Human Rights Watch raised concerns over the number of people being detained unlawfully in overcrowded cells for lengthy periods, including women with young babies who were accused of aiding the insurgents. They were later released owing to a lack of evidence linking them to the conflict, and the judiciary pleaded with the security forces to exercise caution during arrests.<\/p> <p>Machado says there is a need for everyone to go through the lawful justice process because many have been arrested and have not seen a court, which allows for radicalisation to take place. \u201cMany are arrested and placed in jail for months in the same cells with insurgents. Once released, they are either further radicalised, recruited or join voluntarily, or they are unable to be located as they do not return to their villages because of the fear of reprisals and stereotypes,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>In disturbing footage circulated in September, a naked woman is seen running as she is hounded by a group of men \u2013 one of whom is video recording the incident \u2013 clad in security force uniforms and carrying heavy arms. As the woman slows down, they catch up to her and one starts beating her with what looks like a stick before telling her to go. Another man then shoots her at close range before she is hit by a hail of more than 30 bullets. Even when her lifeless body is on the floor and a man says in Portuguese \u201cthat\u2019s enough\u201d, different men continue to shoot at her before one says proudly to the camera, \u201cWe have killed Al-Shabaab.\u201d<\/p> <p>On 10 September, Colonel Omar Nala Saranga, a spokesperson for the defence ministry, said \u201cone of the tactics used by terrorists in their macabre incursions against the population is to pretend to be elements of the FDS [Defence and Security Forces]\u201d. He denied Amnesty International\u2019s allegations of abuses by claiming that the videos and pictures were fake. He distanced the FDS from the murder and essentially claimed that it was the work of militants. In mid-September, the ministry condemned the act but did not confirm or deny that these were members of its rapid intervention unit.<\/p> <p>Machado says the actions of the security forces and the government are boosting rather than reducing the capacity of the insurgents, and the government is losing the trust of the people as more heinous allegations of human rights violations, including beheadings and torture, surface.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey need to stop people from being recruited. In an environment of mistrust and resentment, it\u2019s very easy to divide and rule. And if the government really wants to recover that trust from the Mozambicans, one thing they should do is to communicate better on what they are doing and protect people\u2026 People also need to see people in uniforms as their protectors, not their offenders or abusers,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Humanitarian crisis<\/p> <p>In areas such as Macomia and Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, where villages have been attacked and the conflict has been problematic, the healthcare offered was already deficient before the violence flared up. \u201cHumanitarian groups that were operating in some of those areas \u2026 have left because of the [lack of] security. The kind of shelter they had was poor, but some of it was also destroyed by Cyclone Kenneth which hit the country, so the government was already struggling to take care of people in those regions,\u201d said Machado.<\/p> <p>At the end of September, Minister of Economy and Finance Adriano Maleiane stated that a finance margin was needed to redirect resources to support \u201cthe war effort\u201d, describing the situation in Cabo Delgado as bad for families and the economy. \u201cThe few resources we are allocating to the social areas are not sufficient and we must invent \u2026 more resources for the war,\u201d he said in Maputo.<\/p> <p>However, Machado says the government needs to ensure that there are strategies in place to deal with the humanitarian crisis coming out of this conflict. \u201cIn a moment of conflict, all the resources available go to ensure that the insurgents are defeated and the locals are left on their own\u2026 Those who manage to get to camps find other challenges such as a lack of tents, low supplies of food, sanitation issues, cholera and malaria.<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople need shelter, they need food, missing persons will need to be found, children have been away from school for the past three years, hospitals and schools are getting destroyed. The level of trauma that these people are affected by is high,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>This article was first published on New Frame<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3TX9T2ZCBBGM5ZUIFHTYYL153YLZWY"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":698,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"September","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cabo Delgado","country":"Mozambique","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civilians, women, children, rape, murder, FDS","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"September","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cabo Delgado","country":"Mozambique","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civilians, women, children, rape, murder, FDS","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":972955560,"Input.title":"Guantanamo Bay is America's enduring shame","Input.publish_date":"2021-03-05 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>On 12 February, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked by a reporter whether the new Joe Biden administration intends to shut down the notorious Guantanamo Bay Prison by the end of the US president's first term in office. Her non-committal answer was, \"That's certainly our goal and our intention.\"<\/p> <p>Psaki may have sounded reassuring that the untold suffering experienced by hundreds of men in this American gulag \u2014 many of whom were surely innocent \u2014 would finally be coming to an end. However, considering the history of Guantanamo and the trail of broken promises by the Barack Obama administration, the latest \"goal and intention\" is hardly encouraging.<\/p> <p>Compare the new language with that of Obama's impassioned diatribes about humanity, justice and American values, which he utilised whenever he spoke of Guantanamo. \"Gitmo has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law,\" Obama said in a speech at the National Defence University in May 2013.<\/p> <p>Enamoured with his every word, Obama's audience applauded enthusiastically, but when he delivered that particular speech, he was serving his second term in office. He had already had ample time and opportunity to shut down the prison which operates with no international monitoring and entirely outside the realms of international and US laws.<\/p> <p>Obama is likely to be remembered for his words, not his actions. Not only did he fail to shut down the prison which was erected by his predecessor, George W. Bush, in 2002, but the Guantanamo industry also continued to thrive during his time in the White House. For example, in his speech, Obama made reference to the high cost of \"a hundred and fifty million dollars each year to imprison 166 people.\" According to the New Yorker in 2016, Guantanamo's budget had grown to \"$445 million\" while Obama was in office.<\/p> <p>READ: Barack Obama and the shattered hopes of a new Middle East<\/p> <p>Yet, as the budget grew by leaps and bounds, the number of Guantanamo prisoners dwindled. There are now just 40 prisoners in the massive edifice of metal, concrete and barbed wire built within a US naval base at the eastern tip of Cuba on land 'leased' by the US in 1903.<\/p> <p>It is easy to conclude that the US government keeps the prison open only to avoid international accountability and, arguably, to extract information by torture, an act that is inconsistent with American law. But this cannot be right. The wars against Afghanistan and Iraq were illegal under international law, but that didn't stop the US and its allies from savagely invading, humiliating and torturing entire populations with no regard whatsoever to legal or moral arguments.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Guantanamo is merely one of many American-run prisons and detention centres operating around the world according to the most ruthless tactics and no rule book. The tragedy of Abu Ghraib, a US military detention centre in Baghdad, only became famous when direct evidence of the degrading and incredibly violent conduct that was taking place within its walls was produced and publicised. Furthermore, many US officials and members of Congress at the time used the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2004 as an opportunity to whitewash and rebrand American crimes elsewhere and to present the misconduct within the prison as if it was an isolated incident involving \"a few bad apples\".<\/p> <p>This argument was made by George W Bush. It was more or less the same logic utilised by Obama when he championed the closure of Guantanamo. Indeed, both presidents insisted that neither Abu Ghraib nor Guantanamo should be made out to represent what America is really all about.<\/p> <p>\"Is this who we are?\" asked Obama passionately as he made the case for the closure of Guantanamo, speaking as if he was a human rights advocate rather than the Commander-in-Chief with the authority to shut down the entire facility immediately. The truth is that the Abu Ghraib tortures were not \"a few bad apples\" and Guantanamo is, indeed, a microcosm of exactly what the US is, or has become.<\/p> <p>From Bagram in Afghanistan, to Abu Ghraib in Iraq, to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, to the many \"floating prisons\" \u2014 news of which was leaked by US media in 2014 \u2014 the US government continues to make a mockery of international and humanitarian laws. Many American officials who genuinely advocate the closure of Guantanamo refuse to acknowledge that the prison is a symbol of their country's intransigence, and refuse to accept that, like any other country in the world, it is accountable to international law.<\/p> <p>This lack of accountability has exceeded the US government's insistence on \"acting alone\" and launching wars without international mandates. One US administration after another has also made it clear that, under no circumstances, would they allow American citizens accused of war crimes to be investigated, let alone stand trial, before the International Criminal Court (ICC). The message here is that even America's \"few bad apples\" can potentially walk free, regardless of the heinousness of their crimes.<\/p> <p>Just months after the Trump administration imposed punitive sanctions on ICC judges for having the audacity to look into possible investigations of US crimes in Afghanistan, it freed the convicted criminals who carried out horrific crimes in Iraq. On 22 December, Trump pardoned four American mercenaries from the private military company Blackwater. These convicted murderers were involved in the killing of 14 civilians, including two children, in Baghdad in 2007.<\/p> <p>READ: The protests may reveal America's social and political decay, but don't expect another revolution<\/p> <p>What became known as the \"Nisour Square massacre\" was another example of whitewashing, as government officials and mainstream media insisted that the massacre was an isolated episode, even while expressing outrage at the unlawful killing. The fact that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, mostly civilians, were killed as a result of the US invasion seems irrelevant in America's skewed logic as it pursues its never-ending \"war on terror\".<\/p> <p>Whether Biden fulfils his promise to shut down Guantanamo or not, little will change if the US remains committed in its contempt for international law and to its undeserved view of itself as a country that exists above the universal rights of everyone else.<\/p> <p>That said, Guantanamo on its own is a crime against humanity and there can never be any rational explanation or justification for holding hundreds of people indefinitely, without trial, without due process, without international observers and without ever seeing their families and loved ones. The explanation often offered by the pro-Guantanamo pundits is that the prison inmates are dangerous men. If that was indeed the case, why were these supposed criminals not allowed to have their day in court?<\/p> <p>According to a report by Amnesty International published in May last year, of the 779 men who were taken to the prison, \"only seven have been convicted\". Worse, five of them were convicted \"as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty, in return for the possibility of release from the base.\" According to the rights group, such a trial by military commission \"did not meet fair trial standards\".<\/p> <p>In other words, Guantanamo is \u2014 and has always been \u2014 a fraudulent operation with no real inclination to hold criminals and terrorists to account and prevent further crimes. Guantanamo is an industry, and a lucrative one. In many ways, it is similar to the American prison military complex, ironically dubbed the \"criminal justice system\". Referring to the unjust \"justice system\", Human Rights Watch derided the US for having \"the largest reported prison population in the world\".<\/p> <p>\"The (US) criminal justice system \u2014 from policing and prosecution, through to punishment \u2014 is plagued with injustices like racial disparities, excessively harsh sentencing and drug and immigration policies that improperly emphasise criminalisation,\" stated HRW on its website.<\/p> <p>The above can also be considered an answer to Obama's rhetorical question, \"Is this who we are?\" Yes sir, Mr President, this is precisely who you are.<\/p> <p>While offering the world's most miserable detention conditions to hundreds of potentially innocent men, Guantanamo also offers career opportunities, military perks and honours, and a seemingly endless budget for a small army to guard only a few shackled, gaunt-looking men in a foreign land.<\/p> <p>Even if Biden is able to overcome pressure from the military, the CIA and Congress and succeeds in shutting Guantanamo down, justice will still be absent, not only because of the numerous lives that are forever shattered, but also because America still refuses to learn from its mistakes. Guantanamo Bay Prison is indeed America's enduring shame.<\/p> <p>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3ZFRE2BDQBT1UZZ8PMPK04FCC1PZXR"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":308,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Nisour Square massacre, 2007, Iraq, Blackwater, children, civilians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Guantanamo Bay, prisoners, extrajudicial imprisonment, war on terror","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","killing","other"],"year":"2007.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Iraq","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Nisour Square massacre, 2007, Iraq, Blackwater, children, civilians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Guantanamo Bay, prisoners, extrajudicial imprisonment, war on terror","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":907333542,"Input.title":"More Evidence of China\u2019s Horrific Abuses in Xinjiang","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-20 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Click to expand Image Government social media post in April 2017 shows detainees in a political education camp in Lop County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang.

(AP Photo\/Rebecca Blackwell)<\/p> <p>The same week that the AFL-CIO called on the US to intervene in Matamoros, the Biden administration decided to file a separate labor complaint, also under the USMCA. It requested that the Mexican government of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (known as AMLO) review a fraudulent union recognition vote involving threats and ballot-stuffing by CTM gangsters, known as charros, aimed at maintaining the CTM\u2019s control over the contract at the General Motors factory in Silao, in the central state of Guanajuato.<\/p> <p>Workers in Mexico should be highly suspicious of these efforts. The same government in Washington is currently backing the massacre of Palestinian workers and children by Israeli bombs and the killing and \u201cdisappearing\u201d of hundreds of Colombian workers and youth by that country\u2019s police, who are trained and armed by the United States.<\/p> <p>The request by the Biden administration follows an earlier letter signed by US Representatives Dan Kildee, Bill Pascrell and Earl Blumenauer asking GM itself to \u201cspeak out against violations of labor and human rights abuses at the Silao GM plant.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Canadian trade union Unifor and the so-called IndustriAll Global Union also released letters to GM and Mexican government authorities denouncing the fraudulent vote at Silao.<\/p> <p>On May 11, the Mexican Labor Ministry acknowledged that it had found \u201cserious irregularities\u201d in the vote at Silao and would order the CTM affiliate to hold a new vote within 30 days to legitimize its contract with GM. The ministry also filed a complaint with state prosecutors, setting the stage for a possible criminal investigation.<\/p> <p>GM said it would hire a firm to conduct an \u201cindependent review\u201d of the allegations, but insisted that Labor Ministry inspectors had supervised the vote and conditions at the plant. However, according to workers at the plant who spoke to the WSWS, the Labor Ministry inspectors would meet only CTM union officials and workers that had been threatened and\/or bribed.<\/p> <p>Having ignored numerous previous complaints by GM workers at Silao, L\u00f3pez Obrador himself said last Wednesday that \u201cthe US government is right,\u201d adding that \u201cWe had confirmed it and it had been condemned.\u201d He then promised to respond to the US request \u201cimmediately.\u201d<\/p> <p>In a statement pledging to cooperate with the inquiry, the CTM directly addressed the real concerns of the ruling class. \u201cThe CTM does not generate conflicts,\u201d it declared, \u201cnor is it an obstacle for the development of industry and trade.\u201d<\/p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the AMLO government will assist the CTM and GM in carrying out another fraudulent vote fraud to renew their contract. That would require demonstrating majority support for the contract, with \u201cyes\u201d votes representing at least 30 percent of the total workforce. Alternately, AMLO might allow another registered trade union to negotiate and compete against the CTM for a separate contract.<\/p> <p>This validation process is a new requirement for all contracts under AMLO\u2019s \u201clabor reform,\u201d which incorporates the labor provisions of the USMCA. However, in the two years since the \u201creform\u201d took effect, AMLO has not only given a free hand to the CTM, but has continued, like past governments, to rely on its violent harassment and policing of workers to suppress their struggles.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Mexican Labor Minister Luisa Alcalde has insisted that it is acting in \u201cdaily coordination with US labor authorities,\u201d and that the 500,000 contracts in the country will most likely not be revalidated before the May 2023 deadline. Nor has the ministry given any sign that it intends to invest in the enforcement resources required to oversee all these procedures. When asked about the lack of enforcement of the labor reform, AMLO has simply said that he will not interfere in \u201cinternal\u201d union affairs.<\/p> <p>Far from the dawn of \u201cunion democracy\u201d in Mexico, or the crusade against CTM corruption that AMLO promised, the USMCA and his government\u2019s labor \u201creform\u201d program are aimed at extinguishing the fires of socialist internationalism wherever they erupt among Mexican workers influenced by the World Socialist Web Site. In addition to belonging to the one-million-strong auto workforce in Mexico, what the workers at Tridonex and Matamoros have in common is precisely their connection to the WSWS.<\/p> <p>The labor reform was rushed into law in May 2019 after tens of thousands of maquiladora workers organized wildcat strikes in opposition to the CTM. As analyzed by the WSWS in articles widely shared by Matamoros workers, Susana Prieto worked with US-aligned \u201cindependent unions\u201d to sideline the democratic strike committees and mass assemblies set up by the workers themselves. During a mass march to the nearby US border at Brownsville, Texas, the Matamoros strikers called on American workers to join their struggle and made numerous appeals to workers internationally, through the WSWS.<\/p> <p>After initially insisting that workers had to rely on the hated CTM union locals at Tridonex and other plants, Prieto and the Electricians Union (SME)\u2014both long-time collaborators of the AFL-CIO\u2014formed the SNITIS \u201cindependent\u201d union to channel and suppress the ongoing unrest.<\/p> <p>With billions of dollars in auto parts, electronics and defense products on the line in Matamoros, Prieto subsequently worked to contain new waves of wildcat strikes in 2020 by workers demanding shutdowns with full compensation when workers began falling ill with COVID-19. Prieto and SNITIS subordinated this struggle to AMLO\u2019s May 2020 decrees declaring all manufacturing to be \u201cessential.\u201d<\/p> <p>Then, in January 2021, SNITIS called on Matamoros plants to strike for a 15 percent wage increase. No plant won the full increase and dozens of workers were fired.<\/p> <p>Thousands more workers have been fired in reprisals for the strikes in 2019 and 2020. SNITIS, however, has refused to organize any struggle against the layoffs and firings. Instead, Prieto used the 2021 strikes as a stunt to announce her entry as a candidate of AMLO\u2019s Morena party in congressional elections to be held next month.<\/p> <p>A worker at the sugar processing factory Batory, who remained anonymous for fear of reprisal, told the WSWS that a group of workers fired in January sought help from Prieto, \u201cand she told them that they knew what they were getting into and refused to help them.\u201d The worker continued: \u201cNow they are sad and regret having listened to her. The activist Susana Prieto ended up being more charra than the [CTM] charros.\u201d<\/p> <p>At the GM plant in Silao, a group of rank-and-file workers called the Generating Movement, who had been fighting for years to rid themselves of the CTM, joined online calls organized by the WSWS with American autoworkers ahead of and during the September 2019 strike at GM in the United States. The Generating Movement workers acted courageously and in a principled manner to support the GM strikers in the US by refusing to go along with demands by GM at Silao for speedup and mandatory overtime. The company retaliated by carrying out numerous firings.<\/p> <p>Since this brave intervention, the AFL-CIO, the SME and other unions have sought to pressure the Generating Movement into organizing within one of the \u201cindependent\u201d unions vetted by the Mexican government and sponsored by US imperialism.<\/p> <p>In sum, the Mexican and US authorities, with the help of pseudo-left outfits, are employing the prospect of replacing the CTM goons by \u201cindependent\u201d charros sponsored by Washington to head off the struggle of workers to unite with their class brothers and sisters to the north and oppose capitalist exploitation.<\/p> <p>Within the United States, the complaints over union votes in Mexico coincide with an ongoing campaign by the Biden administration to prop up the existing trade unions, most recently by officially backing the unionization drive of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) at Amazon\u2019s Bessemer, Alabama, plant. Less than 13 percent voted for the union.<\/p> <p>This expression of opposition to the pro-corporate unions in the US coincides with the sentiments of workers at the Silao plant, who have voted by similar percentages to reject the CTM.<\/p> <p>For his part, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement: \u201cThe USMCA requires Mexico to end the reign of protection unions and their corrupt deals with employers.\u201d As Trumka himself well knows, if such a policy were enforced in the US, the AFL-CIO would be dissolved. As he was issuing this statement, a federal judge was sentencing Dennis Williams, former president of the United Auto Workers, to 21 months in jail for having stolen millions in union dues.<\/p> <p>Just as workers in Mexico face corruption, sellout contracts and harassment and violence by CTM charro officials, American workers confront similar conditions at the hands of the unions in the US. Nor is it any different for workers around the world.<\/p> <p>Promoting the myth being advanced around the USMCA labor provisions and Mexico\u2019s \u201clabor reform,\u201d the New York Times wrote: \u201cThe trade deal seeks to improve labor conditions and pay for workers in Mexico, which proponents say would benefit American workers by deterring factory owners from moving their operations to Mexico from the United States in search of cheaper labor.\u201d<\/p> <p>This narrative, while professing concern for workers, is based on the same reactionary and nationalist claims used by the AFL-CIO to divide American workers from their class brothers and sisters across the border, blaming Mexican workers for taking \u201cAmerican jobs.\u201d American workers, according to this narrative, must accept endless concessions in wages, pensions, health care and working conditions to prevent jobs from going abroad.<\/p> <p>By pitting workers against each other, the capitalist rulers have been able to slash real wages for workers on both sides of the border over the past four decades, as the maquiladoras in Mexico grew dramatically.<\/p> <p>Within the US, the Democratic Party is seeking to breathe new life into the rotten corpse of the AFL-CIO, which is entirely integrated into the state. Its foreign policy arm, the Solidarity Center, receives 96 percent of its funding from the State Department.

No one has been found guilty \u2013 yet.<\/p> <p>The documentary, Murder in Paris by Enver Samuel, which showcases the clues, is one of the most moving you could watch.<\/p> <p>In a surprise move, it was aired on SABC this year, on Human Rights Day. A surprise, given the doccie\u2019s unstarry-eyed critique of the ANC. After all, historically the public broadcaster is known to, more often than not, bend to the will of the board, which in turn succumbs to that of political power, or a political faction in power.<\/p> <p>It was a privilege to be on a panel recently to discuss the documentary showing the layers of deceit, cover-ups, sexism and the political inaction to date at the South African Communications Association\u2019s (Sacomm\u2019s) annual conference in 2021.<\/p> <p>Dulcie September was the ANC\u2019s representative in Paris. She popularised the liberation movement by telling the story in Europe of apartheid\u2019s brutality, the death squads, killings, imprisonments, tortures, solitary confinements. Quite by chance, she intercepted a telephone call, stumbling across shenanigans between the apartheid regime and France on arms deals. Then, she started looking for facts, which took her to Pelindaba nuclear plant, and international collusions.<\/p> <p>September reported to the ANC in exile that she was being followed, and her life could be in danger. Her superiors told her she was being \u201cparanoid\u201d and \u201chysterical\u201d. After work, as she was about to enter her flat in Paris, she was gunned down, shot in the face five times. It is now a 33-year-old case. No one has been prosecuted for her murder. Why? The film is littered with clues, pointing to a witch-hunt, while showing the power of excellent investigative journalism.<\/p> <p>Evelyn Groenink, investigative journalist and author of Incorruptible: The Story of the Murders of Dulcie September, Anton Lubowski and Chris Hani, who features strongly in the film, states that it was always assumed the apartheid regime murdered September. However, when she opened her mind to other possibilities she found new clues, then other facts.<\/p> <p>This has echoes with the era of the information disorder today; something just has to have a little bit of truth in it for it to spread. The apartheid regime was wicked with its death squads and assassinations, so it was easy to go down the path Groenink first took. Two years after dogged determination she discovered the arms deal connections.<\/p> <p>September was gunned down because she was on to something; Aziz Pahad (one of her ANC bosses) says this himself, in the movie. Both Samuel and Groenink articulate in different ways that if September had been a man she would not have been labelled a drama queen.<\/p> <p>Now that France legally recognises that apartheid was a crime against humanity, the case can be reopened. And it has. When Emmanuel Macron visited SA this year, he said the matter \u201cwould be looked into\u201d. Whatever that means, it\u2019s some little acknowledgment.<\/p> <p>It is also now up to civil society to hold the powerful to account, and lobby for this investigation not to die. Samuel wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask what the ANC government is doing about the unsolved murder. But there has been no response from his office via spokesperson Tyrone Seale.<\/p> <p>This film is a media act of activism. Its method is to unmask footage from the past, trace people using the internet, connect with the anti-apartheid movement in Europe and interview family members in Cape Town. The archival material is fascinating: French TV, September\u2019s speeches, her voice and nuances show us who she was \u2013 far from a hysterical drama queen. After all, the murder indicates she was spot-on to be worried about her safety. The emotionally evocative film peels back layer after layer from lack of political action, witch-hunts and blatant sexism to international collusion in infamous arms deals.<\/p> <p>A long time ago, the then ANC\u2019s president Oliver Tambo said \u201cno stone will be left unturned\u201d to find September\u2019s murderer. This has not happened. Today there are small stones turning in a progressive direction: the public broadcaster \u2013 the SABC \u2013 shows the documentary, attesting to media freedom at the largest media in SA.<\/p> <p>But politics is fluid today. Just as quickly as these stones turn, they turn back again. The ANC, after suffering serious blows in the local government elections, showed some humility. This was acknowledged in the media. Then, in a sad about-turn, the organisation reverted to type when its Fikile Mbalula and Jessie Duarte berated the SABC for contributing to its losses.<\/p> <p>The SABC, of course, was doing its job by highlighting failures of service delivery. The ANC does not own the SABC. Within days, SABC head of news and editor-in-chief, the fair and balanced Phathiswa Magopeni, who was also at the helm when the Murder in Paris documentary was aired, suddenly and \u201ccoincidentally\u201d has spurious disciplinary charges brought against her. Her hearing is due in the first week of December. This is obfuscation, deflection, Scapegoatism 101.<\/p> <p>From one witch-hunt to another. Civil society and journalism must fight this latest intervention, or suppression, at the SABC, leaving no stone unturned.

The European Union, other trading partners, and donors, should press for time-bound action to repeal the abusive law and reject the government\u2019s proposed amendments, which would not end widespread abuses.<\/p> <p>The 59-page report, \u201cIn a Legal Black Hole\u2019: Sri Lanka\u2019s Failure to Reform the Prevention of Terrorism Act,\u201d documents the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration\u2019s misuse of the PTA against the minority Tamil and Muslim communities, and to suppress civil society groups. The administration rejected pledges by the previous government to repeal the law after it was readmitted to the EU\u2019s Generalized Scheme of Preferences plus (GSP+), which grants Sri Lanka special tariff-free access to EU markets.<\/p> <p>\u201cSri Lankan authorities continue to use the Prevention of Terrorism Act to sweep away targeted people\u2019s basic rights, reneging on past government promises to repeal the law,\u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cProposed government changes to the PTA appear aimed to assuage the concerns of the EU and other governments, without ending abuses.\u201d<\/p> <p>This report is based on Human Rights Watch research on the Prevention of Terrorism Act carried out since 2018, interviews conducted between January and December 2021, and a review of newly available court documents. Human Rights Watch wrote to the attorney general of Sri Lanka and to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, and received a response from the commission which is included in the report.<\/p> <p>The PTA allows the authorities to arrest people without warrants for unspecified \u201cunlawful activities,\u201d and to detain suspects for up to 18 months without producing them before a court. This denies suspects\u2019 basic due process rights and removes safeguards that would help protect them from abuse, effectively creating a legal black hole, Human Rights Watch said. Under the government\u2019s proposed amendments, published on January 27, 2022, this period of detention without judicial oversight would be reduced to 12 months.<\/p> <p>Between 1983 and 2009, during the civil war between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the authorities used the law primarily against suspected members or supporters of the LTTE or other armed groups. Since the deadly 2019 Easter Sunday bombings by a little-known Islamist militant group that targeted churches and hotels, the authorities have used the law to arbitrarily detain hundreds of Muslims. In the past three years the authorities have arrested over 600 people under the PTA, according to Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka data.<\/p> <p>Many suspects have been held for years awaiting trial. Statistics indicate that most are tortured in custody, and convictions frequently rely on confessions obtained under torture. The government\u2019s proposed amendments would leave provisions that have led to widespread torture intact, including on the admissibility of confessions to the police, and the authorities\u2019 power to detain and interrogate suspects at any place of their choosing.<\/p> <p>The proposed amendments would not, for instance, have prevented abuses against Ahnaf Jazeem, a 26-year-old Muslim poet, who was arrested under the act in May 2020 and accused of promoting \u201creligious extremism\u201d in a 2017 book of Tamil verse. Jazeem testified in a July 2021 Supreme Court affidavit that police interrogators threatened \u201cto hang him from the roof and beat him.\u201d<\/p> <p>After 18 months in PTA custody, when he was released on bail, Jazeem told journalists that the police denied him proper food and the use of a toilet, kept him in handcuffs, and initially refused him legal counsel. \u201cThey forced me during this time to deliver a confession,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threatened me saying that they would keep me in prison for 15 or 20 years.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hejaaz Hizbullah, a prominent Muslim lawyer, was arrested under the act in April 2020, accused of aiding the Easter Sunday suicide bombers. While the initial allegations were dropped, the police made new allegations under the act of causing \u201ccommunal disharmony\u201d to extend his custody. Students alleged that police coerced them to testify that Hizbullah incited violence at a school. He remained in custody at the time of writing.<\/p> <p>The Rajapaksa administration has used the PTA to detain or intimidate the families of victims of past abuses, human rights activists and lawyers, and journalists. \u201cWhen we talk to the families of the disappeared, they say they can be arrested at any time,\u201d said an activist working with the Tamil community. \u201cPolice are arresting people for posting pictures on Facebook. They can arrest you for anything.\u201d<\/p> <p>The EU had removed Sri Lanka from GSP+ in 2010 amid rights violations at the end of the civil war, but readmitted the country in 2017 after the then-government renewed commitments to adopt and implement 27 human rights and other international conventions, and in particular to repeal the PTA. This followed a consensus resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2015, in which Sri Lanka agreed to ensure accountability and reparations for war crimes, to investigate enforced disappearances, and to repeal this law. Most of these pledges have yet to be fulfilled.<\/p> <p>In June 2021, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the European Commission to \u201cpush for advancement on Sri Lanka\u2019s human rights obligations and demand the repeal or replacement of the PTA\u201d when assessing Sri Lanka\u2019s eligibility for GSP+ status. A review is currently underway, and is expected to be completed later this year.<\/p> <p>The government\u2019s proposed amendments to the PTA were published two weeks ahead of a meeting with the EU to examine Sri Lanka\u2019s compliance with obligations under GSP+. The Rajapaksa government has since early 2021 pledged to review provisions of the act. Yet, the government introduced an ordinance in 2021 that would make the law even more abusive. Proposed changes to the Code of Criminal Procedure would also further undermine human rights protections.<\/p> <p>Before enacting any counterterrorism law, the Sri Lankan government should conduct meaningful and inclusive consultations with civil society groups and adopt the \u201cnecessary prerequisites\u201d set out in December 2021 by seven United Nations human rights experts for meeting Sri Lanka\u2019s international human rights obligations, Human Rights Watch said.<\/p> <p>The UN experts noted that the PTA contradicts Sri Lanka\u2019s obligations under several international human rights conventions. Sri Lanka\u2019s participation in GSP+ includes a commitment to implement these conventions. The proposed amendments do not bring the PTA into compliance with international law under any of the benchmarks set out by the UN experts.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Rajapaksa administration\u2019s abusive actions will not be addressed by its misleading proposal to amend the PTA,\u201d Ganguly said. \u201cThe EU, United States, and United Kingdom should hold the Sri Lankan government to its international obligations and push for meaningful action to protect human rights.\u201d<\/p> <p>Download the full report.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3L4YG5VW9P7KTSPV64ZBF5TH8Y2DDX"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":982,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"04","date":null,"city":"Sri Lanka","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, tortured","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahnaf Jazeem","victim_keywords":"muslim, poet, arreseted","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hejaaz Hizbullah","victim_keywords":"arrested, lawyer","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","torture"],"year":"2020.0","month":"04","date":null,"city":"Sri Lanka","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalist, arrested, tortured","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Ahnaf Jazeem","victim_keywords":"muslim, poet, arreseted","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Hejaaz Hizbullah","victim_keywords":"arrested, lawyer","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":901979704,"Input.title":"Ayoola Babalola: Journalist arrested by DSS over articles on Buhari, Tinubu regains freedom","Input.publish_date":"2020-01-28 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Ayoola Babalola, the journalist arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) and charged with offences, including incitement and conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace, has been granted bail.<\/p> <p>Babalola has been in prison since last Thursday.<\/p> <p>His lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, announced, Monday night, that his client regained freedom after meeting bail conditions.<\/p> <p>\u201cJournalist, Mr Emmanuel Ayoola Babalola was released from the Ibara prison, Abeokuta after we perfecting his bail conditions\u201d, the fiery rights activist tweeted.<\/p> <p>On Saturday, DAILY POST reported how the DSS hurriedly charged Babalola to court.<\/p> <p>He was picked up over articles about President Muhammadu Buhari, national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinunu, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and #RevolutionNow convener, Omoyele Sowore.<\/p> <p>Narrating Babalola\u2019s ordeal, Effiong said the student activist was arrested and charged to court for allegedly publishing certain articles in a Campus Newspaper called GAPOSA Trumpet in which he served as the Editor.<\/p> <p>\u201cBabalola recently graduated from the Gateway Polytechnic located in Sapaade, Ogun State, where he read Mass Communication\u201d, he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe said articles which were deemed critical of President Buhari, APC Leader, Sen.

Swedish prosecutors have dropped the investigation into the ten-year old rape allegation. Furthermore, a U.S. federal judge has dismissed a Democratic National Committee lawsuit accusing Russia, the Trump campaign, Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange, and others of conspiring to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.

Schneir writes that Assange \u201cis now accused of publishing the Manning documents on his WikiLeaks website. This is a far more serious matter\u2014the first time in the history of the United States that the publication of truthful information has been defined as a crime.\u201d In other words, we are talking about a journalist who may be prosecuted for journalism.<\/p> <p>Caitlin Johnstone warns that \u201conce the Assange precedent has been set by the US government, the US government isn\u2019t going to be relying on your personal definition of what journalism is; they\u2019re going to be using their own, based on their own interests.\u201d When Mike Pompeo was Trump\u2019s CIA director, he pulled out of his pocket a nonsense definition of Assange with no basis in law: a \u201chostile non-state intelligence service.\u201d Yes, informing people about U.S. war crimes is hostile from the perspective of the U.S. government, but how can Assange be an intelligence service if he is serving everyone in the world who has Internet access?<\/p> <p>WikiLeaks Showed Us How Washington Deceives Japan<\/p> <p>Let us look at how WikiLeaks has improved our understanding of the ways in which Washington (mis)treats its most important ally, Japan. Assange\u2019s non-hostile service, including a \u201cpublic library of US diplomacy,\u201d has greatly expanded our understanding of how Washington exploits Japanese people.<\/p> <p>Edward Snowden, a truth-teller who helped Washington for many years, alerted us to the fact that Washington was backstabbing Japan. For example, we heard in Oliver Stone\u2019s film \u201cSnowden\u201d that if Japan went \u201crogue\u201d and stopped obeying Washington, they could shut down Japan\u2019s power grid. Snowden also informed us that Washington was spying on everyone around the world, including the people of allied states such as Japan.<\/p> <p>By sharing the cables that exposed wrongdoing, WikiLeaks has again confirmed for those of us in Northeast Asia that Washington is not to be trusted, even by precious allies like Japan, despite the fact that Tokyo and Washington are in constant, close consultation. The Japan-based journalist David McNeill quotes a Japanese newspaper: \u201cThe U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and the State Department exchanged 5,697 diplomatic cables between 2006 and 2010 (226 of them secret), the third largest number from any diplomatic mission after Ankara and Baghdad: The cables include classified documents on Okinawa, diplomatic relations with North Korea and China, and joint ballistic missile defense.\u201d That is an average of four messages per day.<\/p> <p>An expert on US bases in Okinawa, Japan, Maedomari Hironori emphasizes how strange the Washington-Tokyo relationship is: \u201cRight in the middle of the metropolis of Tokyo there exists a giant base for another country\u2019s military, and although Japan is put in a subservient position with respect to Washington, none of the citizens of Japan are concerned about this. They approve of this US privilege. Nobody knows how often occupying troops are forgiven for the violation of our laws. US military aircraft are guaranteed free passage through the air space of our territory. And they get a free pass when they fly at low altitudes in residential areas.\u201d (September 2018 issue of the progressive political magazine Sekai)<\/p> <p>Through WikiLeaks, however, we received solid confirmation that what Washington really cares about is the \u201crelocation of Futenma Marine Corps Air Station on Okinawa and providing funds for USMC-related facilities on Guam.\u201d (Quoted by Shorrock in The WikiLeaks Files). Those are the words of the US embassy in Tokyo in a secret cable to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when it was reported that the purpose of her trip was supposed to be offering \u201creassurance\u201d to the Japanese government that We were on their side.<\/p> <p>\u201cCough up the cash,\u201d America says to its sidekick Japan. Shorrock notes that Japanese taxpayers were supposed to provide $900 million for the \u201cUSMC-related facilities on Guam.\u201d From that same cable we learn that \u201cour,\u201d i.e., Tokyo and Washington\u2019s, \u201cmissile defense cooperation is moving forward quickly and we are increasing bilateral planning coordination and intelligence sharing.\u201d Many astute observers had already gathered as much, but it is one thing for a newspaper journalist to say it, and quite another to see the Bully Government saying it.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the \u201cmissile defense cooperation\u201d and \u201cintelligence sharing\u201d here encompassed Japan\u2019s interest in purchasing the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense system or Aegis Ashore. (In the end, Japan went with Aegis Ashore). Assange has suggested that the US provoked North Korea, such as through its war games, so that North Korea would continue to develop nukes and missiles and the US would have an excuse to install THAAD in South Korea. And he criticized the deployment of THAAD in South Korea in the context of US relations with China. (There is a concern that \u201csince China sees THAAD as actually directed at it, Beijing may well respond by expanding its arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles\u201d. In short, the leaked cables show Washington manipulating both South Korea and Japan in order to sell them THAAD and Aegis, complements of Lockheed Martin.<\/p> <p>In the case of Japan, Okinawa is Japan\u2019s \u201csacrifice zone,\u201d gifted to the US military, and now used as a U.S. training center for Middle East wars. But many Japanese and a few good Americans would like to know more specifics, about in what manner Tokyo is pressured to manipulate Okinawa, to violate the constitution of Japan, block democracy, and continue their assault on the living things of the ocean in Henoko, Okinawa. As Maedomari sees it, we do not know about who is responsible for what, and there is no accountability in Okinawa, because discussions between Washington and Tokyo are hidden in a kind of \u201cblack box.\u201d<\/p> <p>The face that Washington presents to the world is very different from the face that we get a glimpse of through WikiLeaks cables. WikiLeaks confirmed that the NSA has spied on Japanese companies, too. As early as 1999, it was rumored in Japan that Washington\u2019s Ladylove satellite communications interception facilities at Misawa Air Base were part of the ECHELON civilian telecommunications monitoring program. We heard that surveillance at the Base allowed the US to gather intelligence from conversations held at the prime minister\u2019s residence in Tokyo. At the time it sounded crazy, but WikiLeaks has confirmed that it is true: Our Government spies on elite Japanese politicians as well as major Japanese firms. But Tokyo\u2019s special \u201cclient state\u201d relationship with Washington is so precious to Japan\u2019s elites that the Japanese government could only muster up the courage to call this violation of trust \u201cdeeply regrettable.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cClothed in the rhetoric of civility, they continue to enact Manifest Destiny,\u201d Nozomi Hayase writes in \u201cImprisoned Light of Our Civilization that Kindled the Heart of Democracy,\u201d in In Defense of Julian Assange. Yes. Our Government with its War Machine continues to implement the Open Door Policy. But this must be hidden from the eyes of Washington\u2019s closest allies, both the governments and their citizens, if it is to succeed. Hayase exposes the lack of free exchange of information and ideas in Japan when she writes that WikiLeaks \u201callows marginalized perspectives to come forward and challenge the claims of professional journalists.\u201d Hardly any such journalists in Japan have written about Assange or quoted WikiLeaks cables. (See also Hayase\u2019s CounterPunch essay.) The anonymous Japanese journalist quoted by David McNeill may be right that journalists in Japan \u201cdo not approve of what Assange did.\u201d<\/p> <p>It is through the work of WikiLeaks that Japanese can see how Our Government is complicit in supporting Their Government\u2019s illegal whale killing; They can see how Their Government communicated to Our Government their preference for a \u201cdivided Korean peninsula to one reunified under Seoul\u201d (McNeill); They can see that Their Government is bending to pressure from Our Government to start selling weapons overseas, that Washington wants Japan to sell the \u201csophisticated system known as the SM-3 (a ship-based missile system) to other nations, possibly including South Korea,\u201d even if Japan is forced to \u201crewrite its tight restrictions on weapons exports, which have been a pillar of the nation\u2019s post-World War II pacifism\u201d (McNeill); and They can see that Tokyo is backstabbing the hibakusha (A-bomb survivors) with the help of Washington elites who feel no remorse for Truman\u2019s war crime. In 2001 we in Japan learned from WikiLeaks that the US Ambassador to Japan cabled then Secretary of State Clinton about the idea of Obama apologizing to Japanese: \u201cBoth governments must temper the public\u2019s expectations on such issues, as the idea of President Obama visiting Hiroshima to apologize for the atomic bombing during World War II is a \u2018non-starter.\u2019\u201d This showed everyone in Japan that Tokyo\u2019s efforts on behalf of the hibakusha were a \u201csham,\u201d as one representative of the Hiroshima Alliance for Nuclear Weapons Abolition called them.<\/p> <p>The Bully never misses an opportunity to raise the stakes and run toward the precipice of the disaster of war in Northeast Asia. Japan and South Korea already pay for most of Our expenses incurred at the bases that they host, but when asked, \u201cHow much should we give?\u201d Washington only replies, \u201cMore more more.\u201d It is poetic justice that the greedy billionaire Trump is the spokesperson for Our Greedy Government and Greedy Corporations, demanding of Japan and of South Korea that they pay five times more. At least the South Koreans are outraged.<\/p> <p>Conclusion<\/p> <p>A number of people, including John Pilger, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture Nils Melzer, and Editor-In-Chief of WikiLeaks Kristinn Hrafnsson have informed us that Julian Assange\u2019s health is being ruined, i.e., knocked down by years of being stuck in unhealthy physical environments and undergoing psychological abuse. Melzer said, \u201cMy most urgent concern is that, in the United States, Mr. Assange would be exposed to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights, including his freedom of expression, his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d In his view, these governments (including the US, the UK, and Sweden) are \u201cganging up to deliberately isolate, demonise and abuse\u201d Assange.<\/p> <p>The problem for Washington is that if Assange successfully pulls off this bee sting without getting his head cut off, other journalists will follow in his footsteps. Even Japanese, who mostly trust Washington, might start to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d when Washington twists their arm demanding they pay more for Washington\u2019s empire. They might start to wonder if the US-Japan Security Treaty (anpo) is all that it is cracked up to be. Worst of all, more Japanese may start dropping their prejudices against Okinawans, line up alongside them, and collectively say no to Japan\u2019s participation in Washington\u2019s endless wars.<\/p> <p>In Japan, there is less free flow of information than in the US, and therefore, the information that Assange and WikiLeaks provide us is an especially precious resource. Japanese and Americans, rise to the occasion, for the sake of the freedom of the press, if not for the sake of a great journalist who is being unjustly abused.<\/p> <p>Many thanks to Stephen Brivati for comments, suggestions, and editing.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"35U0MRQMULMXR6G6NYDLWLBNCMUVOY"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":718,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2016","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, extradition, Ecuadorean embassy, failing health","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"insufficient info","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2016","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, extradition, Ecuadorean embassy, failing health","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":876209412,"Input.title":"Saudis hit again!

Sanctions against alleged perpetrators where there is strong evidence of serious abuses are among the measures recommended to strengthen accountability.<\/p> <p>There has been a flurry of activity by the regime and its critics in the run up to the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). This is due to run from February 28 to April 1 2022, including a discussion on March 3 on Sri Lanka. In March 2021, a resolution highly critical of the regime\u2019s treatment of ordinary Sri Lankans was passed the UNHRC. The Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, was asked to monitor the situation and report back.<\/p> <p>While the government has made much of its proposed reforms to the harsh Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the recent update on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka suggests that these are inadequate. Meanwhile, in the light of the Rajapaksa government\u2019s failure to bring perpetrators of serious crimes to book, others abroad are beginning to step in, a trend which will intensify. On February 24, the day before the advance unedited version of the report was published, British war crimes police arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of a Tamil journalist, Mylvaganam Nimalrajan who was murdered in his home in Jaffna in October 2000.<\/p> <p>The crisis caused by the Russian state\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will overshadow the UNHRC\u2019s gathering. It has also added to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic instability, caused in part by mismanagement, and further undermined confidence in the political leadership, on top of the impact of other scandals. As Foreign Minister G.L. Peiris and his colleagues seek to win support from overseas governments and international institutions, the pressure to make more substantial changes will increase.<\/p> <p>A grave situation<\/p> <p>Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka mentions the impact of the economic crisis, including food poverty, and overall paints a sobering picture a year after the previous report, indicating that the hoped-for progress has not materialised. Issues include erosion of the independence of public bodies such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and Right to Information Commission. Civilian government functions are increasingly being militarised; in some cases, current or former military officers \u2013 including some accused of serious human rights violations \u2013 have been placed in senior positions in ministries.<\/p> <p>While some of the land that the army took in the North and East during the civil war has been returned, further disputes have arisen. Some are a linked to a Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management in the Eastern Province headed by the Defence Secretary, supposedly seeking to preserve Buddhist sites but in practice resulting in takeover of local people\u2019s land. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa spoke at the UN General Assembly of the Government\u2019s \u201cfirm intention to build a prosperous, stable and secure future for all Sri Lankans, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender.\u201d Yet in reality, Ms. Bachelet suggests, \u201cactions by the Government during the past year have reinforced the nexus between Sinhalese nationalism, Buddhism and the state, increasing the sense of marginalisation and anxiety among Tamil, Muslim and Christian minority communities, and undermining the prospects for reconciliation.\u201d<\/p> <p>A Task Force on legal change headed by the leader of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), which is a \u201cBuddhist\u201d extremist organisation notorious for hate speech and worse, a statue of the Buddha put up (despite a court order) on what is believed to be the site of an ancient Hindu temple, measures targeting Muslims and failure to protect churches from attack are examples.<\/p> <p>The report describes how civil society organisations, victim groups and human rights advocates are being targeted. The High Commissioner welcomed moves to reduce prison overcrowding during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the release of pre-trial detainees on bail. But suspicious deaths in custody have continued, along with torture and other mistreatment of those imprisoned or detained. A PTA Amendment Bill was brought before Parliament in February 2022, with some positive aspects but still falling far short of meeting international human rights obligations; arbitrary detention and torture are still far too easy.<\/p> <p>While some longstanding detainees have been released, other people were still being locked up under the PTA and Ms. Bachelet again called for a stop to its use until replaced by a more just law. In March 2021 new de-radicalisation regulations had been added so that people could be detained for up to two years without a case going before a court.<\/p> <p>Inadequate progress in reconciliation and accountability<\/p> <p>With regard to allegations of past abuses, \u201cThe High Commissioner is gravely concerned about the continuing precarious situation of the families of the disappeared \u2013 the majority of whom are represented by women. In addition to their suffering and anguish in not knowing the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones, they continue to struggle with the desperate economic and social consequences this has had on their lives,\u201d made worse by harassment and surveillance.<\/p> <p>Some payments have been made to those whose lives have been damaged by past violence but detailed information is lacking and there have been workshops aimed at reconciliation yet, the report suggests, justice is crucial.<\/p> <p>The dropping of charges against a former Navy commander for his involvement in the abduction and disappearance of 11 boys and men in 2008 and 2009, who was then appointed as the Governor of the North Western Province, again signals an unwillingness to address grave abuses. Failure to investigate more fully the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, including the role of security forces, is another concern.<\/p> <p>The report explains that the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights has been recruiting specialist staff and compiling information on alleged abuses by both the state and other groups (the UN has consistently condemned the Tigers too for violating human rights).<\/p> <p>Facing the challenge<\/p> <p>One paragraph that has been the focus of wide attention raises the issue of what can be done by the international community to acknowledge and respond to the suffering of those harmed by the regime\u2019s failures. It states, \u201cThe High Commissioner\u2019s previous report recommended that, among a range of measures, Member States explore possible targeted sanctions against credibly alleged perpetrators of grave human rights violations and abuses. On 10 December 2021, the United States Government announced that two Sri Lankan military officers implicated in grave violations would be designated under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation Act, 2021 and ineligible for entry to that country.\u201d Not surprisingly, talk of sanctions has been met with strong reactions.<\/p> <p>The report points out that this is a major piece of work and the extent of what can be achieved will largely depend on the support of members states and level of funding.<\/p> <p>The conclusions underline the fact that human rights abuses and threats to democracy are not only historical: \u201cIn the last two years, the independence of the judiciary, the Human Rights Commission and other key institutions have been eroded, and democratic space, including for human rights advocacy constricted. There has been a further drift towards militarisation and an emphasis of Sinhala nationalism and Buddhism in State institutions has become more visible, increasing the marginalisation and uncertainty of minority communities, and undermining reconciliation. The forthcoming Constitution drafting process will be of critical importance for the independence of key institutions and issues of devolution and human rights should be monitored closely.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ms. Bachelet recognises signs of renewed openness of the government in engaging with her office and initial steps towards reform, including changes to the PTA but urges the government to go further and deeper. Although the government emphasises reparation and development, a broader approach is vital, according to the report.<\/p> <p>There are a range of recommendations for the Sri Lankan authorities to strengthen human rights, as well as some aimed at the international community. These include working with victims to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed by all parties, continuing to explore possible targeted sanctions against those facing credible allegations of grave violations and protecting asylum seekers at risk if sent back.<\/p> <p>The government disputes the accuracy of the report; however the claims made tie in with other findings from organisations gathering and analysing evidence on human rights in Sri Lanka. Foreign Minister G.L. Peiris is due to lead Sri Lanka\u2019s delegation to UNHRC and speak during the interactive dialogue on March 3.<\/p> <p>As yet more information comes to light about the scale and gravity of the wrongs done to ordinary Sri Lankans by people misusing power, it will become increasingly hard to ignore the calls for truth and justice as a foundation for healing and rebuilding.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3VLL1PIENS3E0QLGOV2OHROJ0WMZOM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":674,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["killing"],"year":"2000","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jafna","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mylvaganam Nimalrajan","victim_keywords":"Tamil, journalist, murder","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil society organisations, human rights, journalists, activists, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["killing"],"year":"2000","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Jafna","region":"None","country":"Sri Lanka","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mylvaganam Nimalrajan","victim_keywords":"Tamil, journalist, murder","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"civil society organisations, human rights, journalists, activists, Sri Lanka","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":943414175,"Input.title":"False rumour of kidnap accused\u2019s death penalty sentence originated from click-bait article","Input.publish_date":"2020-08-25 16:07:56+02:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>False rumour of kidnap accused\u2019s death penalty sentence originated from click-bait article<\/p> <p>Copyright AFP 2017-2022.

In essence, the theme prioritises humanitarian assistance as one of the pathways to recovery.<\/p> <p>As we commemorate International Human Rights Day, it has to be noted that civil, political as well as socio-economic rights have largely come under threat within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) due to the advent of Covid-19 with the political elite abusing the lockdown regulations to tighten their grip on power by weakening checks and balances and this press release has a special focus on the failures\/violations that were exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>These include gross human rights violations in the form of rape, torture, discrimination, corruption, inadequate provision of health services, food insecurity among other rights violations. Consequently, the democratic deficiencies in most SADC countries have been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>Many SADC countries issued decrees that gave the police and the army expanded powers to enforce lockdown regulations but this, later on turned to be a consolidation of authoritarian rule with the police and the army emerging as the biggest violators of human rights while Covid-19 responses were largely militarised and centralised.<\/p> <p>The \u201cRecover Better- Stand Up for Human Rights\u201d theme dovetails well with the situation in most SADC countries as the advent of the Covid 19 pandemic triggered an upsurge in cases of human rights violations and a dire humanitarian situation.<\/p> <p>The recent World Food Program (WFP) projects that by the end of 2020, 8 million Zimbabweans will need humanitarian assistance, a situation caused by Covid-19, drought and climate change.<\/p> <p>The situation is not that different in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and South Africa where there has been a severe reduction in food production caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>While the South African government has been making attempts to provide safety nets to the vulnerable groups, the situation continues to be dire due to lack of stable economic activity and an upsurge in Covid-19 cases. Corruption has also affected the fight against Covid-19 in South Africa while leaving many citizens vulnerable. A case in point is the issue of the US$26 Billion meant for Covid-19 relief which was largely unaccounted for.<\/p> <p>Cases of rights violations, including displacements and torture were also recorded in South Africa with the major perpetrators being the police and the army.<\/p> <p>In Malawi, senior government officials, including former First Lady, Gertrude Mutharika were implicated in the looting of Covid-19 funds. This came at a time the Malawian government was under fire for failing to cater for vulnerable children during the Covid-19 pandemic as prescribed by the country\u2019s Child Care, Protection and Justice Act.<\/p> <p>Lack of water, soap and personal protective equipment also led to a surge in Covid-19 cases in Malawi\u2019s prisons and by September 2020, 408 prisoners and 26 staff members had been infected.<\/p> <p>Former Malawian President, Peter Mutharika\u2019s proclamation of a national lockdown which was supposed to start on April 18, 2020, was largely viewed as an attempt to suspend Presidential elections and prolong his stay in power. The former President also faced resistance after he proclaimed the national lockdown without putting in place safety nets to cushion vulnerable citizens.<\/p> <p>In Zambia, the situation was slightly similar to Malawi as the Covid-19 pandemic worsened the effects of under-investment in water, sanitation and hygiene services while the government generally failed to provide social safeguards for citizens.<\/p> <p>The police in Zambia fuelled human rights violations after the national police spokesperson announced that Zambian police had adopted a hit and detain strategy while Minister Bowman Lusambo was on record that citizens would be subjected to thorough beatings if they defied the Presidential order to stay at home.<\/p> <p>In Mozambique, the situation needs urgent humanitarian response particularly in the Cabo Delgado region where more than 300 000 people have been displaced as a result of terrorist insurgency. The humanitarian situation is likely to worsen given the displacements and also the fact that this Northern part of Mozambique has some of the highest cases of Covid-19 cases.<\/p> <p>Mozambique has also recorded cases of attacks on journalists who were working to expose corruption related to the procurement of Covid 19 materials.<\/p> <p>In Zimbabwe, human rights violations in the form of abductions, torture, arbitrary arrests, as well as intimidation of journalists for exposing corruption, have been prevalent. The most notable cases of persecution of journalists are those of Tawanda Muchehiwa and Hopewell Chin\u2019ono.<\/p> <p>Chin\u2019ono was arrested in July 2020 for exposing a US$60 Million fraud relating to the procurement of Covid-19 kits. The fraud involved former Minister of Health, Obadiah Moyo who was relieved of his duties after the scandal was unearthed.<\/p> <p>However, the State proceeded to charge Hopewell Chin\u2019ono with inciting public violence and the journalist spent over two months in detention while Moyo was given bail a day after his arrest.<\/p> <p>Access to health also remained a major challenge with the Covid-19 pandemic further exposing the dire situation in Zimbabwe\u2019s hospitals. Cases of patients dying as a result of failure to access health care at public hospitals were recorded and the situation worsened after health workers at the public hospitals embarked on industrial action due to poor remuneration as well as poor working conditions.<\/p> <p>The right to education was also under serious threat as the government failed to provide online learning to learners while teachers continued to protest against poor salaries and poor working conditions.<\/p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to autocratic governments to shrink political and civic space in the above-mentioned countries mainly due to rights violations under the guise of enforcing Covid-19 regulations.<\/p> <p>As the world commemorates International Human Rights Day, the Crisis Coalition would like to call for total commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<\/p> <p>More importantly, we reiterate that \u201cbasic human rights and fundamental freedoms are inherent to all human beings, inalienable and equally applicable to everyone and that every one of us is born free and equal in dignity and rights\u201d.<\/p> <p>We further call for adherence to the core principles of human rights as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and these include universality, interdependence and indivisibility, equality and non-discrimination.<\/p> <p>Post the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an imperative need for new social contracts between governments and citizens while political, economic, social and cultural rights need to be put at the centre of recovery efforts.<\/p> <p>We therefore call upon the SADC bloc to collectively mobilise resources to cushion vulnerable groups through provision of food, healthcare, education including other basic needs.<\/p> <p>We implore SADC to work with other partners and draw up a clear roadmap to recovery post Covid-19 and this roadmap should put human rights at the centre of recovery efforts.<\/p> <p>Source: Crisis

Since that time, thousands of people have been persecuted, violently attacked and arrested for calling for an end to the almost 27-year regime of President Alexander Lukashenko.<\/p> <p>During its annual International Labour Conference (ILC) held in June, the International Labour Organization (ILO) strongly criticised the blatant violation of international labour standards in Belarus. In its report, the ILO Committee of Experts, like the Committee on Freedom of Association earlier, referred to the serious violations of fundamental workers\u2019 rights in Belarus.<\/p> <p>Many workers have been persecuted, beaten up, arrested and dismissed for participating in peaceful demonstrations against the rigged presidential elections in August last year. Unprecedented police brutality was used against tens of thousands of peaceful protesters. Student union members have been expelled from universities. Members of independent trade unions have been systematically intimidated to leave their trade unions or lose their jobs.<\/p> <p>Workers have been imprisoned for minor incidents to prevent any further protest actions. In February, three young steel workers were sentenced to between two-and-a-half to three years in prison for taking part in a strike at the Byelorussian Steel Works (BMZ). Meanwhile, that same month, the offices of the Belarusian Radio and Electronic Industry Workers\u2018 Union (REP) were raided by the police and the chairperson was forced to flee the country.<\/p> <p>Based on the report, the Committee for the Application of Standards (CAS), which brings together government, trade union and employer representatives from the 187 ILO member states, discussed the situation in Belarus. The majority decision of the highest international monitoring body on compliance with international labour standards is crystal clear. Referring to the \u201cthe numerous allegations of extreme violence to repress peaceful protests and strikes, and the detention, imprisonment and torture of workers while in custody following the presidential election in August 2020\u201d, the ILO urges the government to:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Restore without delay full respect for workers\u2019 rights and freedom.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Guarantee adequate protection or even immunity against administrative detention for trade union officials in the performance of their duties or when exercising their civil liberties (freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc.).<\/p> <p>\u2022 Take measures for the release of all trade unionists who remain in detention and for the dropping of all charges related to participation in peaceful protest action.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Refrain from the arrest, detention or engagement in violence, intimidation or harassment, including judicial harassment, of trade union leaders and members conducting lawful trade union activities.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Investigate without delay alleged instances of intimidation or physical violence through an independent judicial inquiry.<\/p> <p>The ILO also strongly condemned President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s demand \u2013 announced during a meeting with Mikhail Orda, the head of the state pseudo-trade union, the Federation of Belarussian Trade Unions (FPB) \u2013 that all private enterprises must establish a trade union within their companies or face liquidation. This is not only a blatant violation of the principle of freedom of association, but it also shows that the subservient official trade unions do not exist to truly represent working people but are state-controlled bodies to be used by Lukashenko to monitor workers, as well as employers, in the private sector.<\/p> <p>Not surprisingly, the Belarusian government representative at the ILC rejected these allegations. The head of the state trade unions, as a faithful servant of the regime, justified the arrest of demonstrating and striking trade unionists by saying that political strikes are also banned in Germany and other countries. The ILO experts, however, had clarified earlier that there is a fundamental difference between trade unions operating in a democratic society and trade unions fighting for democracy itself. They emphasised that political strike action to defend and enforce fundamental democratic freedoms is a fundamental right under ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association.<\/p> <p>The Lukashenko regime was, however, absolutely intransigent. The government representative went on the attack, accusing the independent Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP) of \u201ctaking steps against the interests of the state and the government\u201d and accusing them of \u201cdestructive lobbying\u201d against Belarus.<\/p> <p>At the same time as the negotiations in Geneva were taking place, the regime decided to tighten the criminal law, which, among other things, de facto completely abolished freedom of assembly. The \u201cdiscrediting of the Republic of Belarus\u201d and the insulting of state officials have become new criminal offences. According to a letter written to the ILO by Aliaksandr Yarashuk, president of the BKDP: \u201cThe right of citizens to participate in peaceful assemblies is practically cancelled, as well as the right of workers\u2019 organizations to freely carry out their activities. Such law-making by the authorities further removes Belarus from the implementation of the recommendation of the ILO Commission of Inquiry to bring legislation on public events in line with Article 3 of Convention 87.\u201d<\/p> <p>Support from China and Russia<\/p> <p>In Geneva, Lukashenko could also rely on the cartel of freedom enemies who support each other in the UN system. The Chinese government claimed that the government of Belarus \u201cis firmly committed to the fundamental principles and rights of labour, adopts an open attitude to social dialogue and cooperates constructively with the social partners\u201d.<\/p> <p>Belarus returned the favour in the debate on trade union rights in Hong Kong by stating: \u201cBelarus has noted the systematic and positive approach by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China to strengthening social and labour relations in the SAR of Hong Kong. We believe that the Chinese Government is carefully monitoring and complying with its obligations under the Convention [87].\u201d<\/p> <p>Russia went one step further, not only defending Belarus but criticising those who denounce human rights violations: \u201cThe Russian Federation fully follows the argument of our Belarusian colleagues with regard to the implementation by Minsk of the provisions of the Convention[...]. In conclusion, the intentional fuelling of anti-Belarusian rhetoric, including in the UN, is worrying.\u201d<\/p> <p>The ILO\u2019s findings not only demand clear action by Belarus to respect international human rights, but they also establish a moral imperative for the international community not to stand idly by. The people of Belarus are showing great courage by continuing their peaceful protests. Over 30,000 people have arrested, countless protesters have been beaten and tortured, and every day, people are harassed by the KGB, their homes are searched, others lose their jobs or fear for the safety of their families.<\/p> <p>In view of the continuing repression in Belarus, international solidarity with the people and a clear policy towards the regime are needed at the same time:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Personal sanctions should be extended to a wide circle of senior state officials in the security organs, the judiciary, the media, the presidential administration and the government.<\/p> <p>\u2022 In addition, all appropriate instruments should be explored to increase political and economic pressure.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Independent media, civil society organisations and trade unions in Belarus or in exile need unbureaucratic and generous support.<\/p> <p>\u2022 EU borders must be open for people who want or need to leave Belarus for political reasons. Those who no longer want to live under Lukashenko should be given study, research or work opportunities in Europe.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3G57RS03HJK2M5CMU9XBLAELYQF528"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":567,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"steel workers, trade officials, union leaders, protesters","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"steel workers, trade officials, union leaders, protesters","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":987125429,"Input.title":"Hyundai and Renault-Nissan forced to shut Indian plants due to worker unrest over lack of COVID-19 protections","Input.publish_date":"2021-05-27 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>After rank-and-file workers staged a sit-down strike Monday to protest the lack of COVID-19 protections, management at a Hyundai Motors plant in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu announced a five-day suspension of operations, starting Tuesday. The autoworkers were protesting the dangerous working conditions at the plant, where 150 are currently being treated for COVID-19 symptoms, according to a union official. Ten Hyundai Motors India workers have already perished from the virus.<\/p> <p>Five thousand workers at Renault-Nissan\u2019s car plant, also located in the Sriperumbudur-Oragaram industrial belt, were set to follow the example of their Hyundai colleagues by walking off the job Wednesday. At least five Renault-Nissan workers have lost their lives to the virus. Well aware that social tensions are at the boiling point and that the protest movement could spread like wildfire, Renault-Nissan management subverted the job action by announcing a five-day suspension of plant operations until May 30.<\/p> <p>Renault Nissan Automotive India workers (Credit: global.nissannews.com)<\/p> <p>The Renault-Nissan workers said that their demands for COVID-19 protections had been ignored. CNBC TV18 reported that the workers\u2019 main complaints are a lack of medical insurance, management\u2019s insistence on running the plant at full capacity\u2014making social distancing impossible\u2014and cramped canteens.<\/p> <p>Prior to the shutdown, Renault-Nissan had demanded that workers maintain a backbreaking pace of 27 jobs per hour on line 1 and 40 jobs per hour on line 2. With 95 percent of the workers 40 and younger yet to be vaccinated, management\u2019s decision to keep the factory operating at full tilt has allowed the virus to run rampant through the plant.<\/p> <p>The Tamil Nadu autoworkers\u2019 job action underscores that it is the global working class that is the main source of opposition to the ruling elite\u2019s criminal \u201copen economy\u201d policy, which prioritizes capitalist profit over saving workers\u2019 lives. In spring 2020, autoworkers in Canada and the United States, and other industrial workers in Italy and Spain, carried out work stoppages in open rebellion against the corporatist trade unions, which, like the employers, were desperate to keep production running. These job actions saved countless thousands of lives, forcing the ruling elites in North America and Europe to impose temporary shutdowns that they otherwise had no intention of ever implementing.<\/p> <p>Likewise, the eruption of working-class anger over the callous indifference displayed by the Indian ruling elite towards workers\u2019 lives testifies to the deep and widespread opposition to the \u201cprofits before lives\u201d response to COVID-19 pursued by the Indian government at all levels. India is currently the world epicentre of the pandemic, with well over 4,000 official daily deaths now being recorded. The true depth of the crisis is far worse, with credible estimates suggesting that tens of thousands are dying every day.<\/p> <p>Narendra Modi\u2019s far-right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central government bears chief responsibility for this catastrophe. It has insisted on keeping the economy open at all costs and is refusing to provide social support to the hundreds of millions thrust into destitution by the limited lockdown measures imposed by some state governments. Last month, as daily infections approached 300,000 and official daily deaths climbed past 3,000, Modi declared it was necessary to \u201csave India from lockdown,\u201d not to save the Indian people from the deadly virus.<\/p> <p>However, the opposition parties defend the interests of corporate India no less ruthlessly. In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was recently elected to the state government as the lead party of an electoral alliance including the Congress Party, till recently the ruling class\u2019s preferred party of national government, and the twin Stalinist parties, the Communist Party of India\u2013Marxist (CPM) and Communist Party of India (CPI).<\/p> <p>The DMK regime, like its AIADMK predecessor, which was a close ally of Modi and his BJP, has maintained a policy of allowing factories and other industrial worksites to continue operating as if there were no pandemic. Although the DMK government officially unveiled a statewide lockdown after coming to power, it granted massive exemptions for industrial worksites and factories. Speaking much like Modi, DMK chairman and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin remarked, \u201cLockdowns cannot be the solution, as we also realize that it impacts economic growth.\u201d<\/p> <p>In the face of this brutal class-war agenda, the job actions by the Hyundai and Renault Nissan workers are only the most prominent examples of mounting working-class anger. At MRF Tyres Ltd., in Puducherry, a Union Territory adjacent to Tamil Nadu, workers mounted strikes last week to demand justice and compensation for two workers who had died from COVID-19, and for the immediate shutdown of the company\u2019s plants. More than 300 workers at Caparo India, an auto parts company, took strike action against unsafe working conditions and the death of an unknown number of workers at its plants. The strike, which began on May 15, was sabotaged by the Stalinist-led Centre of Indian Trade Unions federation on May 21.<\/p> <p>In the absence of any official records of worker deaths, and with regional and national newspapers consciously covering up the extent of the slaughter, workers have begun sharing information on workplace deaths via social media. According to these sources, more than 25 workers have died in recent weeks at various globally connected companies just in Tamil Nadu. The death toll is especially high in the Sriperumbudur-Oragaram industrial area, which is located on the outskirts of Chennai, India\u2019s fourth-largest urban agglomeration and Tamil Nadu\u2019s capital. The entire region has been dubbed the \u201cDetroit of Asia\u201d because millions of autoworkers are employed there in sweatshop conditions.<\/p> <p>In the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt in the northern state of Haryana, Rajesh, one of the current leaders of the Maruti Suzuki Employees Union, and various workers forums and blogs, such as the Hindi-language Mehnatkash and Workers Unity, report that more than 20 workers have died during the recent surge in COVID-19 infections. These include five workers at Maruti Suzuki\u2019s plant in Gurgaon, two workers at a Honda plant and one worker at the Tata Motors facility.<\/p> <p>The conditions of brutal exploitation that prevail in the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt were exemplified by the monstrous 2012 company-government frame-up of Maruti Suzuki workers. In 2017, 13 militant workers at Maruti Suzuki\u2019s Manesar car assembly plant were sent to jail for life. Their sole \u201ccrime\u201d was to have led a year-long struggle, including sit-down strikes and occupations, against a brutal work regime and precarious contract-labour jobs and to build an independent union in opposition to a company-backed, state-sponsored union.<\/p> <p>As the anger among workers has grown over the past year over speedup, poverty wages and the lack of COVID-19 protections, the trade unions have worked systematically to isolate and suppress their struggles. The Stalinist-led CITU, Maoist-led AICCTU, and the LTUC in Tamil Nadu have consistently isolated workers\u2019 struggles from one another and from the wider urban and rural workforce. Each group of workers has been left to fight their government-backed transnational employer alone.<\/p> <p>At Renault-Nissan, the Renault-Nissan India Thozhillalar Sangam (RNITS) trade union, which is currently under the control of the Maoist People\u2019s Power group, urged workers last week to focus their efforts on a lawsuit aimed at getting the courts to intervene and order improvements in their working conditions. Providing yet another cynical twist to the ruling elite\u2019s \u201copen economy\u201d policy, the two-judge bench at the Madras High Court promptly responded, \u201c[W]hile the health of workers is paramount, if industries go down there will be no place for them to work.\u201d<\/p> <p>The growing number of unnecessary worker deaths underscores the urgency of an immediate shutdown of nonessential production, including the auto industry, in Tamil Nadu and across India to combat the spread of the disease and save hundreds of thousands of lives. This must be accompanied with full compensation for all workers affected and their families until the pandemic is brought under control.<\/p> <p>The billions made by the automakers and other major companies, and the hundreds of billions India\u2019s billionaires \u201cearned\u201d this year from the monies the world\u2019s central banks poured into the financial markets, must be confiscated to pay for a massive public health program, including free and universal vaccinations and social support for workers, their families, and India\u2019s impoverished masses.<\/p> <p>To fight for this programme, we urge autoworkers to establish rank-and-file action committees in every plant and at every workplace. These committees must become the political leadership and organisational framework through which workers can unify their struggles in a joint counteroffensive to place the protection of the health and very lives of the population ahead of corporate profits.<\/p> <p>The struggle against the pandemic, which is a global phenomenon that knows no boundaries, must be waged on an international basis and as a working-class political struggle. We urge Indian autoworkers and all other workers to lend their support to the construction of the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees, which is spearheading a global mobilisation of the working class, the only social force capable of combatting the pandemic and saving lives. What this requires above all is the fight for the socialist transformation of society, which is the only way to prevent globally organized corporations like Renault-Nissan, Hyundai, and Suzuki from pitting workers against each other along national lines to cut labour costs and making massive profits while their workers get sick and die.<\/p> <p>We urge all workers across India who agree with this perspective to make plans to attend this Sunday\u2019s online meeting \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic in India and the need for a socialist strategy.\u201d It begins at 6 p.m. Indian Standard Time.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3VCK0Q0PO7TZGKFEJMPJW3LSSGWN03"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":969,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Workers, Covid, unsafe","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other non-state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Workers, Covid, unsafe","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1004122033,"Input.title":"UN, human rights groups condemn Taliban's violent crackdown on women-led protests, journalists","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-10 14:37:20-04:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>UN, human rights groups condemn Taliban's violent crackdown on women-led protests, journalists<\/p> <p>The United Nations and human rights groups have condemned the Taliban's ban on all demonstrations and the use of violence days after women took to the streets to protest Afghanistan's newly formed interim government that includes more than a dozen leaders who are designated terrorists and ex-Guantanamo detainees.<\/p> <p>In a statement released Friday, the U.N. condemned the Taliban for its \u201cincreasingly violent response\u201d to organized peaceful protests in which militants used \u201clive ammunition, batons and whips\u201d to beat women and journalists.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe call on the Taliban to immediately cease the use of force towards, and the arbitrary detention of, those exercising their right to peaceful assembly and the journalists covering the protests,\" a spokeswoman for the U.N.
