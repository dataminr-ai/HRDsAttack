But now PM hopes to tighten grip on war-torn Ethiopia","Input.publish_date":"2021-06-20 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Tens of millions of Ethiopians are expected to vote on Monday in crucial elections that could provide a launchpad for controversial prime minister Abiy Ahmed to consolidate his increasingly authoritarian rule.<\/p> <p>Abiy, who won the Nobel peace prize two years ago after concluding a peace deal with neighbouring Eritrea, will face voters at the ballot box for the first time in Africa\u2019s second most populous nation.<\/p> <p>Just over a fifth of more than 500 parliamentary constituencies are not voting due to logistical problems, violence or the war in Tigray.<\/p> <p>The conflict in the northern region broke out in November after fighters loyal to the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), the region\u2019s then-ruling party, attacked government military bases.<\/p> <p>Federal troops forced the TPLF to abandon its stronghold of Mekelle, Tigray\u2019s capital, after six weeks of fighting but have struggled to end an ongoing insurgency.<\/p> <p>The conflict has roots in a struggle for power at a national level. The TPLF dominated the government for decades until Abiy\u2019s appointment by the ruling coalition in 2018. It was unclear if the war would boost Abiy in the polls, analysts said.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning, the war was good for Abiy. The TPLF had been in power for a long time and had done a lot of crimes. They were very unpopular. But now there is a very costly stalemate, it is much more of a problem for [Abiy],\u201d said Yohannes Woldemariam, a US-based independent analyst.<\/p> <p>Supporters of the prime minister are hoping the elections will strengthen his new Prosperity party. The election was originally scheduled for August 2020 but was delayed, with officials blaming the Covid-19 pandemic. It will involve candidates from more than 40 parties.<\/p> <p>Campaigning has been short. Abiy, a 44-year-old former military intelligence specialist, told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters last week at his only rally that Ethiopia would show a sceptical world that he could unite his fractious country.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe whole world is saying we will fight [each other] but we will show them differently,\u201d Abiy told a packed stadium in the western city of Jimma. \u201cThe forces that saved Ethiopia from collapsing will turn the horn of Africa into Africa\u2019s power hub.\u201d<\/p> <p>Violence in Ethiopia, a patchwork of ethnic and linguistic groups theoretically united by a federal system, has surged since Abiy took power and implemented a series of wide-ranging reforms.<\/p> <p>In his first 18 months in power, Abiy freed more than 40,000 political prisoners, brought many more women into high office, lifted a ban on political parties, allowed more media freedom and opened up sectors of the economy. But jails are filling up again, with thousands reportedly held in military camps and more than 20 journalists imprisoned in the past year.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe situation now is as dire as it used to be before, if not more,\u201d said Fisseha Tekle of Amnesty International.<\/p> <p>Many parties in Oromiya, the nation\u2019s most populous region and site of last week\u2019s rally, are boycotting the polls, alleging government intimidation.<\/p> <p>Whatever the results of this week\u2019s poll \u2013 and Abiy is not expected to lose \u2013 he will have to deal with a looming economic crisis. The country of 110 million faces an acute lack of foreign currency and has sought unsuccessfully to defer debt repayments.<\/p> <p>Billene Seyoum, the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman, has described the election as a chance for citizens to \u201cexercise their democratic rights\u201d and accused the international media of mounting a \u201ccharacter assassination of the prime minister\u201d.<\/p> <p>Western diplomats and humanitarian agencies say that 350,000 people in Tigray are now suffering famine, with many millions more threatened by acute lack of food.<\/p> <p>Diplomats warned that if the promised changes did not follow the polls, further collective international pressure would be applied, insisting \u201cif nothing is done, this is going to be an entirely man-made famine\u201d. They said they had received private assurances from senior Ethiopian ministers that restrictions on humanitarian access to famine areas could be eased once the elections were over.<\/p> <p>The UK ambassador at the UN, Barbara Woodward, has already warned: \u201cIt\u2019s not a drought or locusts that are causing this hunger, but the decisions of those in power.\u201d<\/p> <p>So far Ethiopia has ignored traditional diplomatic levers. These include two successive G7 statements, withdrawal of EU funding from the Ethiopian government, and the imposition by the US of visa sanctions on some Ethiopian officials.<\/p> <p>The Observer, Guardian and other media have reported a series of massacres over the last six months, with the most recent just weeks ago. Both Ethiopian and Eritrean troops \u2013 who entered Tigray to support the government \u2013 appear responsible. At least one massacre has been blamed on the TPLF.<\/p> <p>Eritrea spent months denying its troops were in Tigray, but since acknowledging their presence has repeatedly denied any accusations of atrocities. Ethiopian officials have repeatedly said that Eritrean troops would withdraw, but there has been little movement on the ground.<\/p> <p>In one revealing recent incident, a UN truck carrying Eritrean refugees who had lived for many years in Tigray to a camp for displaced people was stopped at a checkpoint approximately 100 miles from the Eritrean border by Eritrean troops, who then forcibly repatriated 38 of them. Only after strong protests from the UN were the refugees returned from Eritrea.<\/p> <p>Analysts say it is unclear whether Abiy wants the Eritrean troops to remain to fight the TPLF, or has been unable to convince Isaias Afwerki, the veteran dictator who has led Eritrea since its independence in 1993, to pull his forces out. \u201cIt has become a survival game for all of them and they all see their survival as being at the expense of the others. It is very sad,\u201d said Woldemariam.<\/p> <p>Abiy\u2019s rhetoric has been uncompromising. While inaugurating a sugar factory in the northern Amhara region on 6 June, he told supporters that Ethiopians face two challenges - \u201ctraitors and outsiders\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cEveryone is expected to first purge traitors and next to stop outsiders,\u201d he said.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"374UMBUHN74H5PFESY4F03TLP0HCTD"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":1236,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with unknown permissions","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2020","month":"November","date":null,"city":"Mekelle","region":"Tigray","country":"Ethiopia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, imprisoned, Observer, Guardian and other media, massacres","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":791,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2020","month":"11","date":null,"city":"Jimma","region":"None","country":"Ethiopia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"government military bases, journalist","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":412,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other"],"year":"2021","month":"06","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Ethiopia","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, people in Tigray, Ethiopians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2020","city":"Mekelle","region":"Tigray","date":null,"country":"Ethiopia","month":"06","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","enforced disappearance","killing","other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, people in Tigray, Ethiopians","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":978678539,"Input.title":"Chad Elections - President D\u00e9by Seeks a Sixth Term in a Region for Old Men","Input.publish_date":"2021-04-08 04:37:07","Input.article_interface":"<p>analysis<\/p> <p>Central Africa boasts many of the world's longest-standing authoritarian rulers. But protests are growing.<\/p> <p>In a familiar pattern than continues to be repeated, President Idriss D\u00e9by looks set to be elected for yet another term in Chad following this Sunday's presidential elections. In power since 1990, this will be the 68-year-old incumbent's sixth term.<\/p> <p>President D\u00e9by's victory at the ballot box may be all but assured, but that's not to say he doesn't face significant opposition. When he was nominated to be the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement's flagbearer this February, the announcement sparked widespread demonstrations. In the capital N'Djamena and other major cities, protesters took to the streets chanting \"no to a sixth term!\" and \"Leave, D\u00e9by!\".<\/p> <p>The government has responded with force. Authorities arrested hundreds of protesters. They charged several with assault and disturbing the public order. In anticipation of more street action, authorities also imposed a blanket ban on protests. Internet restrictions are expected to follow.<\/p> <p>This is all characteristic of D\u00e9by's repressive rule and management of the upcoming elections. For years, his government has overseen sustained attacks against human rights defenders, opposition politicians and journalists. One of Chad's most prominent human rights defender, Baradine Berde\u00ef Targuio, has been detained since January 2020 charged with \"subversive activities on social media\". In November 2020, security forces surrounded the premises of several opposition parties and civil society groups, and raided private radio stations including Radio FM Libert\u00e9.<\/p> <p>Amid this increasingly unequal playing filed, Chad's main opposition leader, Saleh Kebzabo, quit the presidential race in early-March. His decision came shortly after two people were killed as security forces tried to arrest his fellow opposition leader Yaya Dillo.<\/p> <p>A regional problem<\/p> <p>Since he came to power via a coup in 1990, President D\u00e9by has won every election and amended the constitution twice to facilitate his stay in power. His 2005 constitutional revision removed the two-term limit. The 2018 amendments re-imposed it, but ensured it would not apply retroactively while also extending presidential mandates from five years to six. This means D\u00e9by could now stay in power until 2033.<\/p> <p>This determination to cling onto power, along with the brutal treatment of opponents, is consistent with the broader picture in Central Africa. Throughout this region, politics has been militarised and electoral periods are characterised by violence and instability. Authorities target anyone who speaks out - from human rights organisations and the political opposition to trade unions - and presidents maintain a tight grip on power.<\/p> <p>Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang and Cameroon's Paul Biya are two of the world's longest serving presidents, having been in office for 42 and 39 years respectively. The Republic of Congo's Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of Congo is referred to by some as an \"Emperor\", having ruled for 36 years over two periods. Gabon's Ali Bongo has been president for a comparatively brief 12 years but was preceded by his father who ruled for the 42 years before that.<\/p> <p>Along with undemocratic and repressive domestic policies, several Central African leaders' stays in power have been made possible by international complicity. Chad is a strategic US ally in the campaign against Islamist insurgencies in the Chad Basin. Cameroon, Congo and Gabon are among the last bastions of French influence in Francophone Africa. The Central African Republic has presented a useful opportunity for Russia to expand its international standing.<\/p> <p>These alliances of convenience have often provided authoritarian governments with crucial support and funding - some of which has financed security forces that then commit the same kinds of abuses as the groups they are meant to be targeting - while also shielding undemocratic leaders from international censure.<\/p> <p>Pushing back<\/p> <p>As seen in Chad, people across Central Africa are not staying silent. Civil society groups in the Congo and Cameroon, for example, are increasingly speaking out against state excesses and calling for political reforms, starting with free and fair elections and adherence to term limits. Despite the risks, protests against rising costs of living, increasing inequality and the monopolisation of power by ruling elites are growing. Repeats of Sudan's 2019 uprising, which ended Omar al-Bashir's three-decade reign, cannot be ruled out.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Chad Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

They should bolster groups that work on the ground to encourage people and governments to move towards democracy. At the same time, they should demand that foreign governments look beyond their own narrow strategic interests and recognise the impact of the militarisation of politics and the use of violence against civil society, the media and opposition.<\/p> <p>Without this support, local civil society will struggle to push back against authoritarian leaders. They need broader support as they attempt to prevent leaders like President D\u00e9by extending his undemocratic rule and, in the longer-term, resist the plans of ageing presidents to follow in Gabon's footsteps by converting their individual reign into dynastic rule, further extending the cycle of human rights violations and repression.<\/p> <p>David Kode is the Advocacy and Campaigns Lead at global civil society alliance CIVICUS.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"37OPIVELUWI371RL8QRZGP09E31AHZ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":614,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2020","month":"January","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Chad","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Baradine Berde\u00ef Targuio","victim_keywords":"detained, human rights, Chad","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":891,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2020","month":"January","date":null,"city":"N'Djamena","region":"None","country":"Chad","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Baradine Berde\u00ef Targuio","victim_keywords":"human rights defender, detained","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"human rights defenders, opposition politicians, journalists, attacks, violence","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"worker_id":"24528428-dbe4-46d7-bd43-27324cef42f6","work_time_in_seconds":530,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2020","month":"January","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Chad","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Baradine Berde\u00ef Targuio","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2020","city":"N'Djamena","region":null,"date":null,"country":"Chad","month":"January","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Baradine Berde\u00ef Targuio","victim_keywords":"human rights defender, detained","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"human rights defenders, opposition politicians, journalists, attacks, violence","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":994809984,"Input.title":"Former DEA informant arrested in assassination of Haiti president: report","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-13 19:00:53","Input.article_interface":"<p>A former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) informant accused of being involved in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Mo\u00efse has been identified.<\/p> <p>Two U.S. government sources told Reuters that the former DEA informant who was arrested is Joseph Vincent of Florida.

On April 19, 2019 the provisional government had issued a similar recognition.<\/p> <p>While this recognition may surprise many people because there is hardly a single Armenian living in Libya, there are, however, geopolitical reasons for taking such an action. Ever since the toppling and killing in 2012 of Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, the country has been in constant turmoil with various military factions fighting each other to rule Libya.<\/p> <p>The officially recognized government of Libya is limited around coastal Tripoli and Misrata, while most of the Libyan territory is occupied by the Interim Government led by military leader Khalifa Haftar. The internal civil war has been considerably expanded by the interference of external powers in Libya\u2019s domestic affairs. Turkey and Qatar have supported the Central Government with Islamic fighters and military hardware, while the Interim Government has been endorsed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).<\/p> <p>The countries on the opposing sides in Libya are also involved in diplomatic clashes and mass media wars. Last month Saudi Arabia announced that it was blocking access to Turkish news agencies and websites. In return, Turkey blocked Saudi and Emirati news outlets. Furthermore, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan supports the Muslim Brotherhood, while Saudi Arabia, Egypt and UAE are opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt and Turkey have been feuding ever since the pro-Muslim Brotherhood President of Egypt Mohammed Morsi, supported by Turkey, was toppled in 2013. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and UAE have asked their citizens to boycott Turkish products and travel to Turkey.<\/p> <p>These various regional and internal feuds have prompted the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the Libyan Interim Government\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on April 24, 2020. Here is the text of the announcement translated into English:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe recall today the genocide of the Armenian population by Turkey which falls on April 24 of each year. The State of Libya commemorates this anniversary in implementation of Government Decision No. 238 of 2019, which approved this day as a national day to revive it.<\/p> <p>\u201cTurkey\u2019s criminal actions against the Armenian people by burning, deliberate killing, forced deportation, and other ugly acts contrary to all divine laws is a crime against humanity and it must be recognized and granted an official apology to the Armenian people and compensate them for the pains that these massacres have caused which cannot be forgotten from the memory of Armenians and the whole world. As we condemn this crime devoid of any element of humanity, we again call upon the countries of the world to recognize this heinous crime.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is today\u2019s Turkish government, in its new situation, which commits crimes against the peoples of the world by its blatant interference in their internal affairs. Perhaps what it carried out yesterday by bombarding the city of Tarhuna [Libya] with missiles and drones, killing children, the elderly and women, destroying humanitarian convoys, food and medical aid, fuel tanks, bringing in mercenaries and supporting terrorists are other crimes added to a chain of Turkish crimes against people and confirms to the whole world the extent of Erdogan's arrogance and his disregard for all international laws and norms.\u201d<\/p> <p>On April 19, 2019, the Libyan Interim Government had issued a similar statement through its Foreign Ministry which reads as follows:<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Interim Government officially adopted a resolution in March recognizing the Armenian Genocide.<\/p> <p>\u201cOn 24 April 1915, the Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported from Constantinople (now Istanbul) to the region of Ankara, 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders, the majority of whom were eventually murdered.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis was followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian Desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe final death toll of the genocide is reported to be 1.5 million.\u201d<\/p> <p>It should not be surprising that the Libyan Interim Government has issued a statement on the Armenian Genocide because it serves its anti-Turkish political agenda. It would have been more surprising if such an announcement would be made contrary to its own interests.<\/p> <p>All countries cater to their national interests. The Armenian government must also act in a similar manner. Libya is a good example. This is the second year in a row that its Interim Government has recognized the Armenian Genocide. What has been the reaction of the Armenian Government? We are not aware of any public comment to this effect. Wouldn\u2019t it be proper for the Armenian Foreign Ministry to issue a statement welcoming the Libyan announcement? Someday the Interim Government may become the legally recognized government of Libya. Now is the time for Armenia to establish friendly relations with Libya. As Turkey has been isolating Armenia from its neighbors by its blockade and its anti-Armenian economic and diplomatic efforts, Armenia in response should join hands with supportive countries and isolate Turkey to whatever degree it can.<\/p> <p>By establishing good relations with the Libyan Interim Government, Armenia would also be in a good position to affirm its relations with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and mend its non-existent relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

This is because stories of human body part sales and ritual killings in Nigeria dates back to generations amongst all tribes. This is rooted in the African supernatural beliefs. Some herbalists and some people in all the religions believe in the fairy tale efficacy of the said items.<\/p> <p>This warped belief that human body parts of either dead and buried people or murdered humans, especially women, children, the mentally challenged, the disabled and the elderly is the reason there are stories of invasion of cemeteries and various accounts of ritual murders across the country.<\/p> <p>The erroneous belief that fetish use of human parts can enhance riches, elongate life, assist those involved to access political power is reason there are increased cases of missing persons who are often kidnapped by head-hunters who operate as syndicates in various communities in the country. Most of those often arrested by the police, in confessional statements disclose their modus operandi and the names and status of their syndicates and clients.<\/p> <p>The worrisome part of human body parts sales is that the narrative about its efficacy in letting those involved achieve their dubious objectives has no scientific validation. The economic crisis has increased the economic pressure on cititizens with more irresponsible and sadistic individuals and groups indulging in the business of killing other humans to improve their own lot.<\/p> <p>The more frightening dimension of the belief in the assumed efficacy of the rituals is that the perpetrators are so narcissistic they even use their biological relatives like mothers, children, and other close relatives as the witch doctors often make them believe that the closer they are to victims, the more efficacious the rituals.<\/p> <p>The mystery surrounding people\u2019s involvement in rituals with human parts is that it defies tribe, social status and religion. The irony of a country that is seemingly the most religious in the world with more churches, mosques and shrines than industries, but with the most cases of ritual killings and cemetery invasions given the population and statistics, is the hypocrisy of the situation. All the religions practiced in the country all tend to admonish adherents about love and sanctity of the human life but sadly, actions speak louder.<\/p> <p>We find it contradictory that most of those involved in ritual killings and sale of human parts appear religious without the piety that makes them positively functional beings. We feel that while humans have the freedom to choose, there are certain ways that religion can help if well-channelled, to control the erroneous belief in the assumed magical powers of human parts for ritual purposes.<\/p> <p>We equally believe that given the recent upsurge in reports of kidnappings and missing persons, the various tiers of government must begin to address the cases of insecurity with more serious attention on the hideouts of these criminals because they do not operate from a vacuum. The travelling routes and forests can be better secured to keep kidnappers out of business because no one commits such crimes in the open.<\/p> <p>The invasion of cemeteries for body parts may not be a new phenomenon. But again, it is against the African culture to interfere with corpses as it is seen as having grave spiritual implications for those involved. Cemeteries are in well-designated places around the country and should be better secured by the authorities. Beyond the indignities of violating the dead, most dead people died of various contagious diseases like COVID-19 that can be dire for the living.<\/p> <p>Beyond cemeteries, it is the same ritual intents that are fuelling the kidnappings around the country that is almost at epidemic level. Something urgent must be done by governments to protect the people and re-orientate them in ways to cub this social menace that comes with huge socio-economic implications. The world has moved beyond vague superstitious beliefs that enhance poverty rather than development. The human beings being killed are productive citizens that can make changes in the life of a nation. The dead in the cemeteries are supposed to be allowed to rest in peace as is the belief in all human creeds.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"3YO4AH2FPFZKJHS6ZEH00XGXW4L0QU"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":790,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2021","month":"July","date":"12","city":"None","region":"Ondo","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"human body parts, women, children, mentally challenged, disabled, elderly, ritual killings, cemetary invasions","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"worker_id":"24528428-dbe4-46d7-bd43-27324cef42f6","work_time_in_seconds":357,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"Ondo","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":3058,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"07","date":null,"city":"Ondo State","region":"Nigeria","country":"Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"general population","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2021","city":"Ondo State","region":"Ondo","date":"12","country":"Nigeria","month":"07","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"general population","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":938315287,"Input.title":"Normal People stars Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones enjoy socially distanced reunion at the BAFTAs","Input.publish_date":"2020-07-31 19:43:43","Input.article_interface":"<p>Something went wrong, please try again later.<\/p> <p>Get daily celeb exclusives and behind the scenes house tours direct to your inbox<\/p> <p>Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones of Normal People fame reunited on Friday afternoon to attend the socially-distanced BAFTA awards, which were being held at Television Centre, London.<\/p> <p>The pair laughed and joked while adhering to social distancing rules and posing together humorously with a ruler to prove they were staying apart.<\/p> <p>Paul, 24, who recently reportedly joined dating app Raya, looked dapper in a grey jacket and trousers, which he partnered with a plain white T-shirt.<\/p> <p>(Image: 2020 David M.

Last Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that his plans for \u201crestoring democracy\u201d in Venezuela were \u201cgaining momentum\u201d and that he had already made plans to reopen the American embassy in Caracas. The next day, Washington\u2019s regime change specialist John Bolton cryptically announced that \u201cmorning is coming to Venezuela again\u201d soon.<\/p> <p>By Sunday, the coup plotters were lying face down on the concrete, zip-tied, some appearing to have wet themselves in terror when coming into contact with the employees of the \u201chouse of socialist fisherman\u201d in the sleepy coastal village of Chuao. The Trump administration immediately denied all involvement, \u201cit has nothing to do with our government,\u201d the president said yesterday. But as the dust settled, the mercenaries immediately began implicating each other \u2013 and the U.S.<\/p> <p>Asked why there were two \u201cgringos\u201d with him, one detainee responded that they were the \u201csecurity chiefs of the president of the United States; of Donald Trump.\u201d The \u201cgringos\u201d were later confirmed as former Special Forces operators Luke Denman and Aaron Berry, who helpfully brought their passports and even their VA discount cards to the insurrection. The mastermind behind the plan, John Goudreau, also confirmed their identities. Goudreau is a former Green Beret who founded private Florida-based mercenary force Silvercorp in 2018. Silvercorp\u2019s Instagram page even featured now-deleted posts showing Goudreau and his men posing with MAGA hats and running private security for Trump at campaign events. C-SPAN footage of a Trump rally in October 2018 does indeed show them close to the president, patrolling the event. The company\u2019s (since deleted) twitter account was even live-tweeting their secret mission, tagging Trump in a post.<\/p> <p>The mastermind of the foiled coup invasion of #Venezuela just so happens to work security for Trump. https:\/\/t.co\/Ep8TGbDKwY \u2014 Jeb Sprague (@JebSprague) May 5, 2020<\/p> <p>Apparently unaware he was confessing to a capital offense, Goudreau appeared on a Venezuelan show from his home in Florida, insisting that the mission was \u201cstill ongoing, absolutely,\u201d even as his employees were being overpowered by disgruntled lobstermen. \u201cThese guys want to fight!\u201d he added. Goudreau also shared an eight-page document signed by Juan Guaid\u00f3, where the self-declared \u201cinterim president\u201d promised to pay him $212 million to overthrow Maduro, seemingly oblivious to how bad it made them both look. He claims that Guaid\u00f3, notorious for fraud, had refused to pay even the $1.5 million retainer fee. \u201cI\u2019m out a lot of money. A LOT. But the bottom line is a lot of us came together to do this. I\u2019ve been a freedom fighter my whole life,\u201d he said, as an explanation as to why he continued with the plan.<\/p> <p>Silvercorp describes itself as \u201cproviding governments and corporations with realistic and timely solutions to irregular problems.\u201d Apart from coup services, they also offer school shooting seminars ($2,499 for six hours), \u201cmotivation and mindset\u201d talks ($3,999 for six hours) and a $4,999 course on what they call \u201cadvanced urban sniper tactics,\u201d Goudrau claiming that he has \u201chunted the most dangerous game my entire adult life. I\u2019m going to teach you the tools of the trade.\u201d Thus, Silvercorp promises to teach anyone with enough money how to survive \u2013 or commit \u2013 mass shootings.<\/p> <p>A February poll found that American actions are highly unpopular inside Venezuela, with 83 percent of respondents opposed to an invasion and over 80 percent against the current sanctions. Why, then, did Silvercorp and others believe it could overthrow the entire country with 300 poorly trained volunteers? One reason could be the decades of pop culture propaganda aimed at the country. Parks and Recreation presented the country as a joke dictatorship where virtually anything results in an arrest, the plot of The Expendables revolves around a crack team of mercenaries easily taking out a corrupt South American dictator, while a whole series of Jack Ryan follows the CIA agent helping to bring democracy to Venezuela. Unfortunately for Washington, reality bit and Goudreau was less Jack Ryan and more Jim from The Office.<\/p> <p>Social media has also played its part, deleting hundreds of accounts belonging to or supporting the Venezuelan left. Indeed, Twitter deleted the accounts of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned electricity company just before an attack on the power grid on Monday.<\/p> <p>In the midst of a global pandemic, Washington is prioritizing punishing its enemies and pursuing regime change around the world, at the expense of saving its own citizens\u2019 lives. However, due to the enormous power imbalance and the long history of demonizing Venezuela, it is unlikely that there will be serious consequences for the administration for overseeing a second Bay of Pigs fiasco.<\/p> <p>Feature photo | Employees of Silvercorp are arrested by Venezuelan authorities after a failed coup attempt.

But, of course, this is hardly an ordinary situation.<\/p> <p>In the month since the violent attack, we\u2019ve heard stories from senators, representatives, Capitol police, and staffers about the fear, panic, and chaos that engulfed the Capitol during the riot that claimed 6 lives and injured nearly 140 Capitol Police officers. As Republicans rush to ignore the failed insurrection and demand to move on with disingenuous calls for \u201cunity,\u201d hundreds of people are still struggling to recover, both physically and emotionally, from the attack.<\/p> <p>In their passionate letter, the staffers wrote of the attack, \u201cThat mob was incited by former President Donald J. Trump and his political allies, some of whom we pass every day in the hallways at work.\u201d<\/p> <p>They continued,<\/p> <p>\u201cMany of us attended school in the post-Columbine era and were trained to respond to active shooter situations in our classrooms. As the mob smashed through Capitol Police barricades, broke doors and windows, and charged into the Capitol with body armor and weapons, many of us hid behind chairs and and under desks or barricaded ourselves in offices. Others watched on TV and frantically tried to reach bosses and colleagues as they fled for their lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>The letter goes on to say, \u201cOur Constitution only works when we believe in it and defend it \u2026 Any person who doesn\u2019t share these beliefs has no place representing the American people, now or in the future. The use of violence and lies to overturn an election is not worthy of debate. Either you stand with the republic or against it.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cAs congressional employees, we don\u2019t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.\u201d<\/p> <p>The letter organizers reached out to Republican aides to sign, but none did. An anonymous staffer told CNN, \u201cNo one should have to experience something like this in their place of work \u2026 And I think it\u2019s important to tell this part of the story, because it\u2019s not just members of Congress who come to work at the Capitol every day. And it\u2019s not just staffers who work at the Capitol who were traumatized by what happened. And I think that is a piece of it. The trauma is there; the trauma is very real. And anytime that new pieces of information come out, you know, you\u2019re kind of re-traumatized.\u201d<\/p> <p>I honestly hope that everyone who was inside the Capitol that day has access to counseling and post-traumatic care. And I hope that all the republican trolls dismissing their pain and trauma never get to hold office again.<\/p> <p>As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in her Instagram Live, \u201cThe reason I say this and the reason I\u2019m getting emotional in this moment is because these folks who tell us to move on, that it\u2019s not a big deal, that we should forget what\u2019s happened, or even telling us to apologize. These are the same tactics of abusers.\u201d<\/p> <p>(via New York Times, featured image: ALEX EDELMAN\/AFP via Getty Images)<\/p> <p>Want more stories like this?

Photo by Gallo Images\/Fani Mahuntsi)<\/p> <p>On 20 July 2020 a group of armed law enforcement officials broke into the home of award-winning Zimbabwean journalist and filmmaker Hopewell Chin\u2019ono, and abducted him.<\/p> <p>Chin\u2019ono managed to capture the first few seconds of his abduction on video.<\/p> <p>In the video, there\u2019s a knock on the door to the room in which Chin\u2019ono seems to be waiting, ready for his assailants, armed with his phone camera. When the door opens, a man aggressively shouts an order at Chin\u2019ono to put down his phone. Another man visibly quickly steps back, clearly trying to get out of view of the camera, but not quickly enough. Chin\u2019ono delays putting down the phone and they again yell at him: \u201cPut it down!\u201d He finally complies and for a while that was the last we saw of him as a free man.<\/p> <p>When his lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, got to his house, she was confronted by the evidence of the break-in and posted a video showing a broken glass door through which the abductors allegedly gained entrance.<\/p> <p>After his abduction, Chin\u2019ono was taken to a local police station and charged with trumped-up accusations of inciting violence for planned 31 July protests against corruption. Jacob Ngarivhume, the opposition leader who called for the protests, was also arrested.<\/p> <p>Zimbabweans have no doubt whatsoever that Chin\u2019ono is being persecuted for having been among the journalists who exposed looting of Covid-19 funds, scuppering a $60-million deal that would allegedly have benefited, among others, President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his sons. Because of the expos\u00e9, the procurement deal was cancelled and the minister of health fired, a move many wrote off as apparent scapegoating.<\/p> <p>At some point during Chin\u2019ono\u2019s incarceration, George Charamba, the president\u2019s spokesman, posted this on his Twitter page:<\/p> <p>\u201cAl Jazeera\u2019s Hussein detained in Egyptian prison for 1,000 days \u2026 One Egyptian journalist working for Al Jazeera has been languishing in jail for over 1,000 days. Meanwhile even Al Jazeera\u2019s perfunctory campaign for him has grown fatigued. The West is dead silent, and won\u2019t care a hoot. But the message has been driven home: you do not tamper with Egyptian institutions of State in the name of MEDIA FREEDOM or that of GLOBAL NEWS NETWORKS hoping IT CAN\u2019T!!\u2026\u201d<\/p> <p>We took it as a threat that Chin\u2019ono and Ngarivhume were, like the Egyptian journalist, also going to be kept in prison for a long time, and indeed they were.<\/p> <p>Chin\u2019ono and Ngarivhume were remanded in custody for a crime they did not commit. They were incarcerated at Chikurubi Prison where they experienced abuse at the hands of prison officials, who at some point denied them access to basic prisoners\u2019 rights such as food from visitors, warm clothing and private consultations with lawyers.<\/p> <p>Prison officials told Chin\u2019ono and his lawyers that they had been instructed to never leave his side and to sit in on all his consultations with his lawyers. When they fought against this, Ngoni Nduna, the magistrate tasked with Chin\u2019ono\u2019s hearing, accused Mtetwa of posting details about the case on Facebook and demanded she be removed from the case.<\/p> <p>This despite the fact that the Facebook page he cited was a Beatrice Mtetwa fan page, run by a fan who confessed to registering and running it. The courts went on to ban Mtetwa from representing Chin\u2019ono \u2013 a move clearly meant to frustrate him, delay his bail hearing and deny him the right to a lawyer of his choice.<\/p> <p>After a month and a half of incarceration, Ngarivhume and Chin\u2019ono were finally granted bail with stringent conditions. They are not to leave Harare and were banned from Twitter.<\/p> <p>A lot about Chin\u2019ono\u2019s and Ngarivhume\u2019s cases feels like d\u00e9ja vu. It is eerily similar to Jestina Mukoko\u2019s ordeal at the hands of the same perpetrators more than 12 years ago.<\/p> <p>The way they broke into Chin\u2019ono\u2019s home and abducted him without an arrest warrant speaks to the probability that he was a candidate for enforced disappearance, the regime\u2019s favourite way of dealing with dissenters. I believe that had Chin\u2019ono not managed to make a live recording of his abduction, the state would have denied taking him.<\/p> <p>On 3 December 2008, 15 armed men broke into the Norton home of Mukoko, the director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), a journalist and human rights defender. After news of her arrest got out, the government denied taking her. She was detained incommunicado until 24 December 2008, when she was produced at Harare Magistrate\u2019s Court.<\/p> <p>During her enforced disappearance Mukoko had been subjected to inhumane treatment including but not limited to being locked in a freezer, simulated drowning and beatings.<\/p> <p>Instead of freeing Mukoko after producing her, for she had broken not even a single Zimbabwean law, the government remanded her in custody on trumped-up charges of \u201crecruiting persons for training as insurgents or saboteurs\u201d.<\/p> <p>They eventually released her on bail in March 2009, after she had spent three months in custody. Her bail conditions were that she had to report at the local police station in Norton every Friday. She also had to surrender her passport. This went on until September 2009 when the Supreme Court ordered a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings against Mukoko.<\/p> <p>Nobody was ever held personally responsible and punished for her abduction, enforced disappearance, torture, wrongful arrest and many other crimes committed against her and the 23 activists she says she was tortured with. However, in 2018 the High Court of Zimbabwe ordered the state to pay $150,000 in compensation for the abduction, enforced disappearance and torture she was subjected to by state security agents.<\/p> <p>Just like Chin\u2019ono, while in custody, Mukoko was denied adequate health care, reportedly going for at least 10 days without her allergy medication, and was at some point prescribed anxiety and insomnia medication by an army doctor who had, ironically, also taken part in her torture.<\/p> <p>The government of Zimbabwe has been committing violent crimes against citizens from as long ago as 1980, when it waged war on the opposition, Zapu, and went on to kill more than 20,000 civilians in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces, the Zapu stronghold. The operation was called Gukurahundi and many people were abducted, disappeared and tortured.<\/p> <p>We all thought things would change now that former president Robert Mugabe has gone, but evidence shows that instead, government is escalating its violence.<\/p> <p>For four decades, the Zanu-PF government has denied abducting civilians. It has always been a case of the victims\u2019 word against the government.<\/p> <p>In May this year, three women from the main opposition party, the MDC Alliance, were arrested at a police roadblock and taken to Harare Central Police Station, from where they were abducted and disappeared for days. Cecilia Chimbiri, Joana Mamombe and Netsai Marova were dumped outside Harare a few days later, having been physically and psychologically tortured. Police denied ever arresting them, despite the fact that on the day of their arrest, police spokesperson Paul Nyathi admitted to two newspapers that indeed they had arrested the three women.<\/p> <p>They instead rearrested them at the hospital where they were being treated for torture, and charged them with faking abduction. Like Mukoko, they were eventually granted bail, but with punitively strict conditions. Among their bail conditions were orders to report three times a week at Harare Central Police Station, surrender their passports to court authorities and not to interfere with witnesses. They were ordered to continue staying at the addresses given to law enforcement agents upon their arrest and barred from communicating with the media on anything to do with the alleged offence. They were also banned from social media.<\/p> <p>The government, on the other hand, continues to abuse the three on social media and state-controlled media, accusing them of having faked their abduction. The women have no way of defending themselves as they were banned from commenting on the case. Last week, the government aired clearly doctored footage of what they claimed was evidence that the three women were out and about during the time of their abduction.<\/p> <p>In what many Zimbabweans have dismissed as a shoddy propaganda job, the government\u2019s footage shows a car they claim is the Mercedes Benz the victims had been in. However, close inspection of the car in the video shows that it is a BMW. The footage also shows a Mercedes-Benz with its fuel tank on the left side, but later shows \u201cthe same car\u201d with the tank on the right side. This has Zimbabweans convinced that the fact that the government had to go to such great lengths to doctor footage and air it on national TV instead of producing it in court as the trial is ongoing, is clear evidence that they have no case against the three women.<\/p> <p>For four decades, the Zanu-PF government has denied abducting civilians. It has always been a case of the victims\u2019 word against the government.<\/p> <p>But for the first time in 40 years, the government was caught on camera, abducting my book research assistant, 22-year-old journalism student and activist Tawanda Muchehiwa. I will write more about this in an upcoming article.<\/p> <p>In all these cases, the collusion to obstruct justice between government institutions in the persecution of the opposition, human rights defenders and dissenters is glaring. In all the cases, armed forces abduct victims on behalf of government and either disappear and torture them first before dumping them at police stations, or victims are arrested by police and abducted from police custody by agents who go on to disappear and torture them. Those that survive being disappeared are tortured while in the custody of prison officials. All of them are then denied bail for a while and eventually granted bail, but with unreasonable conditions. After some months, the cases are thrown out of court.<\/p> <p>This shows beyond reasonable doubt the extent to which the state is captured. The Central Intelligence Organisation, the judiciary, the department of prisons, the army and the police have been completely captured by Zanu-PF. Instead of serving and protecting the people of Zimbabwe, they are being used to oppress us. DM\/MC<\/p> <p>Thandekile Moyo is a writer and human rights defender from Zimbabwe.

San Diego true-crime author\u2019s latest case: the mysterious death of Rebecca Zahau","Input.publish_date":"2021-04-24 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Caitlin Rother did not set out to become a true-crime writer. But if you look back at the San Diego author\u2019s life, the clues were there all along.<\/p> <p>When she was a general-assignment reporter for the Berkshire Eagle and the Springfield Union-News in western Massachusetts in the late 1980s, Rother spent her spare time reading about sensational murder cases and devious criminals in New York magazine.<\/p> <p>From 1993 until 2006, Rother was a reporter at The San Diego Union-Tribune, where she ended up writing some memorable stories involving bizarre deaths. Like the case of Steven Jean Hoover, a 50-year-old computer programmer who starved himself to death in his Clairemont condominium in 1995.<\/p> <p>And before all that, Rother was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where the La Jolla High School graduate majored in psychology and laid the groundwork for the career she did not see coming.<\/p> <p>\u201cI am interested in why people act the way they do. I am always wondering, \u2018Why do people do this?\u2019\u201d Rother, 58, said during a phone interview from her home in Kensington.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>\u201cI was thinking of being a therapist. At Berkeley, Psychology of the Brain was one of my favorite classes. And then I took Abnormal Psychology, and I thought, \u2018This is too much. I can\u2019t do this every day.\u2019 And this is what I do now. I am basically doing abnormal psychology every day.\u201d<\/p> <p>Since 2004, Rother has written or co-written 14 books, most of them nonfiction accounts of real-life crimes. That lineup includes 2005\u2019s \u201cPoisoned Love,\u201d Rother\u2019s look at the made-for-tabloid TV case of San Diego toxicologist Kristin Rossum, who was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of her husband. In 2012\u2019s \u201cLost Girls,\u201d Rother wrote about the heartbreaking deaths of Amber Dubois and Chelsea King, two San Diego teenagers who were killed by convicted sex offender John Albert Gardner III.<\/p> <p>Rother\u2019s new book comes out on April 27. On the surface, it looks like another true-crime saga. Except for the fact that the death Rother writes about may not have been the result of a criminal act.<\/p> <p>The book is \u201cDeath on Ocean Boulevard: Inside the Coronado Mansion Case.\u201d The case concerns the mysterious death of Rebecca Zahau, whose body was found hanging from a balcony at the historic Spreckels Mansion in Coronado in July of 2011. Her body was naked, and her hands and feet were bound.<\/p> <p>Zahau\u2019s death happened just two days after 6-year-old Max Shacknai, the son of her boyfriend, Jonah Shaknai, took what turned out to be a fatal fall while Max was in the house with her. Investigators from the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department ruled that Zahau\u2019s death was a suicide. Her family believes she was killed.<\/p> <p>In 2018, a San Diego Superior Court jury found Jonah Shacknai\u2019s brother, Adam Shacknai, responsible for Zahau\u2019s death. Later that year, the Sheriff\u2019s Department reviewed the investigation and concluded once again that Zahau\u2019s death was a suicide. Just last month, a San Diego Superior Court judge agreed to hear arguments from Zahau\u2019s family that they should be allowed to see investigative materials that the Sheriff\u2019s Department did not make public.<\/p> <p>A death that doesn\u2019t seem to make sense as a suicide or a murder makes for a puzzle that people can\u2019t stop trying to solve. The Coronado mansion story has been covered by CNN Headline News and the Oxygen and Investigation Discovery cable networks. It has also become a breeding ground for a wealth of conspiracy theories.<\/p> <p>And even after her years of research and many hours of interviews \u2014 including nearly 16 hours of Skype interviews with Jonah Shacknai that didn\u2019t come through until the book was being edited \u2014 Rother herself can\u2019t say for sure what happened.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy agent pressed me to take a position, and I just wasn\u2019t comfortable with doing that,\u201d said Rother, who is working on a sequel to her first (and only) novel, \u201cNaked Addiction,\u201d a mystery set in La Jolla and Pacific Beach. \u201cI went back and forth and I did a lot of investigating, and I don\u2019t know what happened. I can see both sides of it, and I have never been convinced either way. There are big holes in the investigation that will never be filled.\u201d<\/p> <p>For Rother, there was another way in which \u201cDeath on Ocean Boulevard\u201d was more than another true-crime story.<\/p> <p>In 1999, after years struggling with alcoholism and mental illness, Rother\u2019s husband, Rich Rose, hanged himself in a motel room in Mexico. Rose\u2019s death, which Rother wrote about in her frank 2018 memoir, \u201cSecrets, Lies, and Shoelaces,\u201d gave her firsthand insights into the mysteries of being human. Including the mystery of why people go to such great lengths to hide their pain from the ones they love most.<\/p> <p>Rother talks about Rose\u2019s death in the new book, and her insights helped her write a full, empathetic profile of Zahau as well as a detailed accounting of her death, baffling complexities and all. In return, the process of researching and writing about the death on Ocean Boulevard helped her come to terms with the death in the motel room in San Quint\u00edn, Mexico.<\/p> <p>You can\u2019t always know why people do what they do, but in \u201cDeath on Ocean Boulevard,\u201d Rother reminds us of how much you can learn by doing your best to find out.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is not a parlor game. It isn\u2019t about judging,\u201d said Rother, who dedicated the book to Max and Rebecca. \u201cRebecca\u2019s family still cannot let go of this case, and they are not going to until they get the death certificate changed. And the Shaknais lost a little boy. This is a tragedy, no matter how you look at it.\u201d<\/p> <p>Caitlin Rother will discuss \u201cDeath on Ocean Boulevard\u201d with journalist J.W. August at 7 p.m. Tuesday, April 27, in a virtual event presented by the San Diego Public Library.

The shooting resulted in the tragic deaths of six people and the wounding of 12 others. Police are still investigating at press time, but the facts suggest multiple shooters were involved in the incident and that the shooting shared characteristics more in common with general street violence than the type of indiscriminate crimes typically used to promote gun control efforts.<\/p> <p>The incident was dubbed a \u201cmass shooting\u201d by many in the media. This, as Northeastern University Criminologist James Alan Fox has noted in a March 6, 2021 USA Today item titled \u201cYou\u2019re right to be confused about the number of mass shootings,\u201d can be misleading. The professor explained,<\/p> <p>A corollary concern, besides whether the threshold [for a mass shooting] is based on deaths or injuries as well, is the varying nature and location of mass shootings. [One measure of \u201cmass shootings\u201d] include[s] a large share of family shootings in private residences as well as gun battles related to gang conflict or illicit drug trade\u2026 What truly frightens folks are the seemingly indiscriminate and deadly shootings in public locations \u2014 a restaurant, shopping malls, theaters, churches, schools, and now supermarkets. Such dreadful events can happen to anyone, at any time, and without warning.<\/p> <p>Immediately after the incident, President Joe Biden put out a statement demanding more gun control. The April 3 press release demanded, \u201cBan ghost guns. Require background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers\u2019 immunity from liability.\u201d The statement stood in contrast to that put out by the usually flamboyant Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose office noted that the incident was still being investigated, before offering a much milder call to \u201cbring an end\u201d to such violence.<\/p> <p>California already has four-fifths of the gun control measures that Biden proposed. Obviously, none of these measures prevented the Sacramento shooting.<\/p> <p>Ban on So-Called \u201cGhost Guns\u201d (Privately Made Firearms)<\/p> <p>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 29180 requires that a person, \u201cprior to manufacturing or assembling a firearm,\u201d apply to the California Department of Justice for a unique serial number. The law then demands \u201c[w]ithin 10 days of manufacturing or assembling a firearm\u2026 the unique serial number or other mark of identification provided by the department shall be engraved or permanently affixed to the firearm.\u201d The person is then required to notify the state that they have complied with the marking requirements of \u00a7 29180. Further, \u00a7 29180 required owners of all privately made firearms manufactured prior to enactment of the statute to comply with the statute\u2019s marking provisions.<\/p> <p>Those found in violation of \u00a7 29180 face up to a year in prison for an offense involving a handgun and six months in prison for an offense involving a long-gun.<\/p> <p>California has also severely curtailed the sale of common parts used by firearm hobbyists to make their own firearms. Defined as \u201cprecursor parts\u201d by Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 16531, these items are subject to the same background check requirements as firearms under state law.<\/p> <p>Criminalization of private transfers<\/p> <p>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 28050 requires that \u201c[a] person shall complete any sale, loan, or transfer of a firearm through\u201d a licensed firearm dealer pursuant to a background check. Further, Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 26500 provides \u201c[n]o person shall sell, lease, or transfer firearms unless the person has been issued a\u201d dealer license.<\/p> <p>Illegal transfer of a firearm is punishable by up to six months of imprisonment.<\/p> <p>Ban on Commonly-Owned Semi-Automatic Firearms<\/p> <p>California banned commonly-owned semi-automatic firearms (often mislabeled \u201cassault weapons\u201d) in 1989.<\/p> <p>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 30600 provides,<\/p> <p>Any person who, within this state, manufactures or causes to be manufactured, distributes, transports, or imports into the state, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale, or who gives or lends any assault weapon\u2026 except as provided by this chapter, is guilty of a felony, and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 for four, six, or eight years.<\/p> <p>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 30605 provides, Any person who, within this state, possesses any assault weapon, except as provided in this chapter, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for a period not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.<\/p> <p>Ban on Standard-Capacity Magazines<\/p> <p>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 16740 defines \u201clarge-capacity magazines\u201d as \u201cany ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds.\u201d This definition includes the standard capacity magazines sold with America\u2019s most popular firearms.<\/p> <p>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 32310 provides,<\/p> <p>any person in this state who manufactures or causes to be manufactured, imports into the state, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale, or who gives, lends, buys, or receives any large-capacity magazine is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.<\/p> <p>and,<\/p> <p>any person in this state who possesses any large-capacity magazine, regardless of the date the magazine was acquired, is guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per large-capacity magazine, or is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per large-capacity magazine, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.<\/p> <p>The truth is that California\u2019s gun control regime places it below the Constitutional floor when it comes to respect for the Second Amendment right. This may be made clear in the coming months in the U.S. Supreme Court case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen.<\/p> <p>The Suspects<\/p> <p>As of press time, police have made three arrests in connection with the Sacramento shooting. As these individuals have not been convicted of any crime in relation to the shooting they will be referred to as Suspect 1, Suspect 2, and Suspect 3 in order of arrest.<\/p> <p>According to Sacramento NBC affiliate KCRA, Suspect 1 is a 26-year-old male and was booked on charges of \u201cassault with a firearm and being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm.\u201d Summarizing Suspect 1\u2019s criminal history, the news outlet reported,<\/p> <p>[Suspect 1] has been wanted in Riverside County since 2015. Jail records show he has an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor domestic violence charge. According to court documents, [Suspect 1] \u201cinflicted bodily injury resulting in a traumatic condition\u201d to his spouse. [Suspect 1] pled guilty to the charge in 2014 and was sentenced to 30 days of custody and 36 months of probation. The Riverside County District Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed to NBC News that [Suspect 1] later violated two terms of probation: the community service requirement, and the 52-week class requirement. A $5,000 bench warrant was issued by the court in 2015. KCRA 3 Investigates also learned [Suspect 1] spent time in an Arizona prison. He was released in 2020 after serving just over a year-and-a-half for violating probation in separate felony convictions for attempt to commit aggravated assault in 2016, and a conviction on a marijuana charge in 2018.<\/p> <p>Suspect 2 is the 27-year-old brother of Suspect 1. According to the Sacramento Bee, Suspect 2 was booked \u201con charges of assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person.\u201d The Los Angeles Times reported that Suspect 2 was also charged for being in \u201cpossession of a stolen handgun that was converted to be a fully automatic weapon.\u201d<\/p> <p>In an article titled, \u201cA D.A. issued dire warnings about the Sacramento gun battle suspect. He was released early from prison anyway,\u201d the Los Angeles Times noted,<\/p> <p>The man arrested for possessing a machine gun at the scene of Sunday\u2019s deadly shooting in Sacramento was allowed to leave prison in February despite opposition from the county\u2019s district attorney to his early release\u2026 Almost exactly a year ago, Dist. Atty. Anne Marie Schubert\u2019s office opposed [Suspect 2\u2019s] release from state prison to the Board of Parole Hearings in a two-page letter\u2026 The district attorney\u2019s office asked that he not be freed because he is a career criminal and a danger to the community.<\/p> <p>The district attorney\u2019s letter explained,<\/p> <p>\u201c[Suspect 2] has committed several felony violations and clearly has little regard for human life and the law, which can be shown by his conduct in his prior felony convictions of robbery, possession of a firearm and prior misdemeanor conviction of providing false information to a peace officer.\u201d<\/p> <p>The paper reported that Suspect 2 was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on two felony assault charges for beating his girlfriend with a belt and entered the California state prison system in January 2018. Despite, the district attorney\u2019s pleas, Suspect 2 was released in February 2022.<\/p> <p>Summarizing Suspect 2\u2019s criminal history with firearms, the prosecutor explained,<\/p> <p>In January of 2013, just six months after his eighteenth birthday, [Suspect 2] was contacted by law enforcement officers. [Suspect 2] attempted to discard an assault rifle which he had concealed in his waistband under his clothing. The rifle had a pistol grip and the capacity to accept a detachable magazine in front of the pistol grip. [Suspect 2] was also found to be in possession of two fully loaded twenty-five round magazines for the assault weapon.<\/p> <p>Suspect 3 is a 31-year-old male and was arrested on charges of being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. According to an account from USA Today, Suspect 3 \u201cwas caught on camera wielding a firearm after the shooting, though police do not believe the weapon was used in the shootout.\u201d<\/p> <p>Presented with the facts about California\u2019s gun control regime and the criminal histories of those arrested in connection with the Sacramento shooting, it is clear that no amount of gun control could have made a difference in the Sacramento tragedy. Moreover, other criminal justice interventions, perhaps measures tailored to those who actually commit violent crime, clearly had the best chance of preventing this tragedy.<\/p> <p>About NRA-ILA:<\/p> <p>Established in 1975, the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the \u201clobbying\u201d arm of the National Rifle Association of America.

The report from receiver BDO describes a series high-interest loans and a string of missed payments connected to a land-assembly deal in 2017 by Mr. Khavari and his brother Ardavan for a site at the corner of Mortimer and Broadview Avenues in Toronto\u2019s East York neighbourhood.<\/p> <p>Centurion is the first-ranking lender on the file and is owed $8,067,628 after agreeing to lend $44-million for construction of a seven-storey condominium building. Despite receiving planning permission for the condo, almost no work has been done aside from the demolition of a popular local eatery and banquet hall known as Whistler\u2019s Grille and Caf\u00e9 Bar that formerly anchored the site.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat this community has ended up with is an empty lot full of grass, weeds and garbage, while these millionaires are fighting,\u201d said Councillor Paula Fletcher, who voted with Toronto council to approve the project\u2019s rezoning. \u201cIt should never have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the hell are these big money investors doing at this little corner in East York?\u201d The company also owes $146,291 in unpaid property taxes to the City of Toronto.<\/p> <p>Some explanation about what went wrong can be found in a set of affidavits connected to a second unsecured mortgage on the property held by a company called 1001 Broadview Investment Inc. The investors in that company include a high-net-worth family from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia led by Amr Abdulwahab Attar, who brought an unsuccessful insolvency application for the property in 2019.<\/p> <p>Mr. Attar\u2019s affidavit provides an intimate look at how wealthy foreign investors came to participate in an investment in Canada\u2019s real estate market. He describes meeting Michael Decauni, an executive at the small Canadian investment company Callian Capital Partners Inc. (of which the Khavari brothers were equity partners), in Geneva, Switzerland in 2015 that led to an investing relationship. \u201cFor the past few years, my family and I have been interested in investing in the North American real estate market, and possibly immigrating to Canada. In June of 2017, Decauni told me that he and his partners, Khash, Ardavan Khavari and Khalid Khashoggi (\u201dKhalid\u201d), had placed a deposit on [1001 Broadview] using $2.1-million of their own money, and a further US$10-million was required to purchase the land.\u201d<\/p> <p>Mr. Attar said he had turned down an offer to get an 18-per-cent return on a $3-million investment when the condo project was complete, but he agreed to invest if his money would get a 15-per-cent return, paid semi-annually, after being promised his investment would be safe in the event of an insolvency. \u201cDecauni informed me that, more likely than not, the land would be sold at a premium of no less than 25 per cent within the first year, and the Project would not be developed,\u201d Mr. Attar said. In August, 2017, Mr. Attar, his father and sister each pledged $1-million to the project, and in November his mother and a cousin named Walid added another $5-million (the Walid investment would be structured to be compliant with Sharia law). Mr. Attar himself subsequently joined Callian Capital as an executive.<\/p> <p>In 2018, the Attar family members received their scheduled returns: US$75,000 twice that year as the project continued (except for Walid who\u2019s $4-million contribution earned him US$300,000 payments). But in November, 2018, the payments were delayed until January, 2019, after which no further payments were made.<\/p> <p>In a responding affidavit Mr. Khavari agrees with most of those events, but he and Mr. Attar disagree as to why the payments stopped. Mr. Khavari alleges demands from Mr. Attar for extra payments for financing fees and legal fees drained the project\u2019s budget, while Mr. Attar points the finger back at Mr. Khavari and his brother alleging instances of improper invoices. The affidavits also show that the $2.1-million the Khavari\u2019s pledged to the project as equity was actually a high-interest loan from a third party, and funds were also taken out of the project budget to repay that loan.<\/p> <p>None of the allegations have been tested in court.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, the application to appoint a receiver by Mr. Attar was postponed and his family syndicate must now wait for Centurion\u2019s loan to be paid back through the sale of the land before applying to receive any remaining funds.<\/p> <p>Missing from the Attar and Centurion filings is some context for the Khavari family. Khashayar Khavari is the son of Mahmoud Reza Khavari, who in 2011 resigned his job as managing director of Iran\u2019s state-owned Melli Bank and fled to Canada amid allegations of embezzlement and financial fraud. Iran accuses the elder Mr. Khavari \u2013 a dual citizen of Iran and Canada \u2013 of helping embezzle US$2.6-billion out of the country. In 2014, billionaire businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi was executed in Iran for his role in the scheme. In 2017, according to Iranian state media, Mr. Khavari was convicted in absentia by an Iranian court and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Bank Melli and another bank Mr. Khavari led have been accused by the EU and U.S. of laundering funds intended to finance international terrorism and support Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. The allegations have not been tested in a Canadian court, and while Iran has demanded Mr. Khavari\u2019s return Canada has no bi-lateral extradition treaty with the Islamic republic. There is no indication that Mahmoud Reza Khavari is himself involved in the Broadview project.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s not the first time the family has been involved in court actions in this country. In 2016, details about the Khavari family\u2019s business dealings in Canada came to light in lawsuits between them and Sam Mizrahi, a Toronto real estate developer constructing Canada\u2019s tallest residential building at 1 Bloor St. Mr. Mizrahi\u2019s testimony in those cases described feeling pressured to conceal the Khavari connection to two luxury condo projects on claims that the family\u2019s bank accounts in Canada had been frozen following the embezzlement allegations, Mr. Mizrahi also alleged that he was later threatened with financial and reputational ruin by the Khavari brothers.<\/p> <p>The court ruled in Mr. Mizrahi\u2019s favour, denying the Khavaris the $35-million they were seeking. Despite the public and acrimonious dispute, Khashayar Khavari continues to tout the connection, describing Mr. Mizrahi as a former \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d on the website for his H&CO Developments website.<\/p> <p>Mr. Khavari and Mr. Attar did not respond to requests for comment from The Globe and Mail; Dominique Michaud, a partner with Robins Appleby LLP who is representing Centurion said his clients declined to comment on the decision to lend money to Mr. Khavari.<\/p> <p>Your house is your most valuable asset.

It was a conversation on the shrinking media and civic space in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>The colloquium like many of its such and other social engagements that have trailed the Senate\u2019s passing of social media bill, is actually one of the attempts aimed at analyzing the \u2018pros\u2019 and cons of regulating social media by the Nigerian government. They all have been parts of the ways to tackle the Senate\u2019s Social media bill. I may therefore want to take a paradigm shift from analyzing the bill, because this has been done over and over again by different persons.<\/p> <p>Let us point to a few statistics. In September 2019, Joseph Israel a student of Taraba State University was expelled with reasons reportedly connected to his persistent criticism of Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State through his Facebook account. In 2018, Kunle Adebajo of the University of Ibadan was rusticated in 2016 for an article on poor welfare in the institution. In what appears like sporadic attacks on the media in 2019 anyway, journalist Agba Jalingo is in prison as we speak for a press publication which met the Crossriver Governor in discomfort. Part of Sowore\u2019s alleged offenses by the DSS\/Federal government is hinged on using his media platform to insult the president and to cause revolution. To add, as most recent, is the expulsion of Ifemosu Michael by the FUNAAB management over his Facebook post which hammered on the welfare of students on the campus as being neglected by the management in question. Samuel Ogundipe was arrested and tortured after making a publication in 2018. We can go on and on, but Amnesty International had already assisted with another summarized data, which showed that since 2015, more than fifty journalists and bloggers have been arrested, detained and tortured in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>The above paragraph reveals the formally identified attacks on social media, but have we observed recent arbitrary ban and restrictions of Social media handles, Twitter and Facebook accounts? In this kind of restriction, the social media corporations are equally complicit. It is mostly done to notable critiques or activists in the social media. Political icons or major influencers may be spared, and if you are the type that only tweets about BB naija, Naira Marley, Aso Ebi Bella and the kinds, your freedom of expression is also in actual fact unlimited like Glo, until data and browsing experience unlimitedly disappoint you.<\/p> <p>Social media bill like any other restrictions on civic space has been on since the periods the government and corporations discovered that the system had actually created what could hastily aid its own collapse.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>The social media bill is beyond restricting hate speech, it is also about restricting the possible fast and mass social mobilization against the status quo that may come through the internet. From the students angle, those in the 17th and 18th centuries had to go through rigorous efforts in connecting and mobilizing themselves across campuses in the country. Now, fast mobilization and information spread is done with the social media. Suspend a student in FUNAAB today, and counterparts are already aware in Zaria, Minna and across boards. Victimization on campuses is now rather more on a selected few, an action which school authorities even want to do silently as much as possible. Unlike the old days of suspending students in their scores at a time on a single campus. I delved into tertiary institutions because the culture of tyranny has been extended to these places, to the extent of stalking students social media accounts and activities. These ruling ideologies in our tertiary institutions are equally the ideologies of the ruling class. As instructed, the culture of tyrant rulers and submissive followers is built from these universities to the larger world. That is cycle Nigeria unfortunately revolves within.<\/p> <p>The world is advancing but Nigeria appears regressing into barbarism. Senates in other climes are discussing policies on health, education, security and climate change as they affect people\u2019s lives, but our senators are bent on how to punish social media users. Well, I may want to pitch tent with those who think that we do not need the social media law in so far the country already has laws against libel and slander, and individuals who feel offended by media posts or press publication should explore those legal means. Quite alright, we should be having more policies that advances our human liberty than those that restrict them.<\/p> <p>On another hand anyway, it is not enough to debate this social media law or how it should work, but there is a major problem arising, it is that the Nigerians who elected the lawmakers have totally handed over governance to them. This absolute power is what corrupts absolutely.<\/p> <p>Apparently, there is no single serious bill to discuss before the Nigerian Senate that has to do with development of Nigerians, and as we know it, an idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop. Thus, one of the ways that might be needed to engage them on this Social media bill is for the people to begin a counter campaign which can include sponsoring bill to the house, such as #freeWiFi project for Nigerians. After all we have evolved beyond the generation of apes. Cost of internet subscriptions that is sometimes more than feeding costs is already another way for social media restriction. Without doubts, social media access has since been restricted through various means, discussing the bill in the Senate is merely about formalising the restrictions. Nigerians should not be carried away, let\u2019s put work on their tables!<\/p> <p>The people should get involved in the affairs of the Senate, and in governance in general by sponsoring bills and campaigning for major demands that will lift standards of the people. Nigeria has a reasonable quota of educated population, and even more civilized minds than those that rule them. Leaving the governance to these rulers is what lasts this tyranny.<\/p> <p>Advertisement<\/p> <p>#FreeWiFINigeria<\/p> <p>Gbenga Oloniniran.<\/p> <p>[email protected]<\/p> <p>He also tweets at,

The Rappler\u2019s story on May 29, 2012, cited an intelligence report linking him to a murder, drug dealing, human trafficking and smuggling. The site\u2019s lawyers disputed any malice and said the time limit for filing the libel complaint had passed.<\/p> <p>\u201cRappler and both accused did not offer a scintilla of proof that they verified the imputations of various crimes in the disputed article upon the person of Keng,\u201d Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa said in the 36-page ruling. \u201cThey just simply published them as news in their online publication in reckless disregard of whether they are false or not.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThe decision for me is devastating because it essentially says that Rappler, that we are wrong,\u201d Ressa said in a news conference after the ruling.

She posted bail for the case last year and will study possible appeals in the next 15 days, Te said.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe verdict against Maria Ressa highlights the ability of the Philippines\u2019 abusive leader to manipulate the laws to go after critical, well-respected media voices whatever the ultimate cost to the country,\u201d said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch, adding the verdict was \u201ca frontal assault on freedom of the press that is critical to protect and preserve Philippines democracy.\u201d<\/p> <p>President Rodrigo Duterte and other Philippine officials have said the criminal complaints against Ressa and Rappler were not a press freedom issue but a part of normal judicial procedures arising from their alleged violations of the law.<\/p> <p>Keng dismissed the allegations in the 2012 story as baseless and false and said Rappler refused to take down the story online and publish his side of the story. He provided government certifications in court to show that he has no criminal record and sought 50 million pesos ($1 million) in damages, but the court awarded a much smaller fine.<\/p> <p>Rappler\u2019s lawyers said the story was based on an unspecified intelligence report and that Philippine penal law requires a libel complaint to be filed within one year. Keng filed his lawsuit in 2017, five years after the story was published.<\/p> <p>A cybercrime law, which the Rappler journalists allegedly violated, was also enacted in September 2012 or four months after the story written by Santos was published. Rappler\u2019s lawyers said Philippine penal laws cannot be retroactively applied.<\/p> <p>Rappler, however, acknowledged that it updated the story in February 2014 to correct a misspelled word but said it did not make any other changes. The Department of Justice, which brought the libel charges to court, contended that by updating the story, Rappler effectively republished the story online in 2014, an argument dismissed by the news site\u2019s lawyers.<\/p> <p>The Department of Justice argued a complaint can be filed under the 2012 cybercrime law for up to 12 years, countering Rappler\u2019s argument that Keng\u2019s complaint was invalid due to being outside the one-year deadline for libel.<\/p> <p>The Manila court upheld the 12-year period.<\/p> <p>As Rappler\u2019s chief executive officer, Ressa faces seven other criminal complaints in relation to legal issues hounding her news agency, including an allegation that it violated a constitutional ban on media agencies receiving foreign investment funds.<\/p> <p>Ressa, who has worked for CNN and was one of Time magazine\u2019s Persons of the Year in 2018, has accused the government of abusing its power and of using the law to muzzle dissent.<\/p> <p>Many news outlets in the Philippines and beyond have criticized Duterte\u2019s policies, including his anti-drug campaign that has left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.<\/p> <p>Duterte has openly lambasted journalists and news sites who report critically about him, including the Philippine Daily Inquirer, a leading daily, and ABS-CBN, the country\u2019s largest TV network which was shut down by the government\u2019s telecommunications regulator last month after its 25-year franchise expired.

For decades, the comedian and actor struggled with drugs and alcohol, and those close to him have gone on to share stories about Pryor\u2019s substance abuse problems since his passing in 2005.<\/p> <p>Read on to learn more about Pryor\u2019s struggle with drugs and alcohol, and what his friends and family have had to say about it.<\/p> <p>1. Wife Jennifer Lee Moved out After Discovering Pryor Was Freebasing Cocaine<\/p> <p>In a 2013 interview with BBC, Pryor\u2019s wife at the time of his death, Jennifer Lee, shared that she moved out of his home once she discovered he was freebasing cocaine.<\/p> <p>\u201cAfter two weeks of watching him getting addicted to this stuff I moved out. It was clear the drug had moved in and it had become his lover and everything. I did not exist.\u201d<\/p> <p>Despite Pryor\u2019s drug addiction, the pair later married, although the relationship was tumultuous.<\/p> <p>In an interview with ABC after Pryor\u2019s death, Lee said, \u201cHe was a real piece of work. He was a handful, and a wonderful handful, and a heartbreaker and the love of my life.\u201d She continued, \u201cHe had a very dark side that could strike out and be very volatile at any moment. He was incredibly loving and vulnerable. When I met him, the thing that struck me most about him was his vulnerability. And I can tell you many women say this about him, that there was something so open and raw and refreshing about him.\u201d<\/p> <p>2. Prior Opened up About Being Sexually Abused as a Child<\/p> <p>Pryor was born in 1940 in Peoria, Illinois, and grew up in a brothel that was run by his grandmother. There, his mother was a prostitute, according to the New York Post.<\/p> <p>When he was seven, according to USA Today, Pryor was sexually abused in an alleyway.<\/p> <p>At age 14, he was kicked out of school. He was 16 when he had his first child with a girl who was also sleeping with his father.<\/p> <p>Unbound reports that Pryor \u201cseems to have seen more as a child than most do in their lifetime.\u201d The outlet goes on to write, \u201cAfter being raped by a teenage neighbour, sexually abused by a priest and losing his cherry to a hooker called Penny, Pryor found he had a flair for comedy.\u201d<\/p> <p>3. He Was Arrested for Drunk Driving in 1978<\/p> <p>In 1978, Pryor was arrested for drunk driving and sentenced to five months in jail.<\/p> <p>That wasn\u2019t his only stint in jail.<\/p> <p>Pryor was also arrested after a physical confrontation with a woman who he was friends with, who would sing in local clubs. Pittsburgh Magazine writes, \u201cPittsburgh police quietly arrested him on Jan. 1, 1963, at the Wylie Avenue boarding house where he was staying. He was sentenced to 90 days for attacking the woman and undoubtedly had to walk across the famed \u2018Bridge of Sighs\u2019 from the Allegheny County Courthouse to the jail. He was supposed to be there for three months but played numbers games while incarcerated and won $70 \u2014 enough to pay his fine. He was released after 35 days.\u201d<\/p> <p>After being released, Pryor moved to New York. Within two years, his career had taken off. Still, Pryor struggled with substance abuse.<\/p> <p>A 1978 People article by Sue Reilly reads, \u201cHe was snorting $100 of cocaine a day, had been arrested for assault and battery, sued for wife-beating, and accused of stabbing a landlord with a fork and of beating a hotel clerk.\u201d<\/p> <p>4.

Enjoy!! 2019-02-04T03:51:35.000Z<\/p> <p>Not long after being arrested for drunk driving, Pryor\u2019s famous \u2018fire incident\u2019 occurred.<\/p> <p>It was June 9, 1980, and Pryor poured rum over himself and proceeded to light himself on fire. At the time, according to The Washington Examiner, he was freebasing cocaine.<\/p> <p>The outlet writes, \u201cHis daughter said her father was in a drug-induced psychosis and poured rum over his body and set himself on fire.\u201d<\/p> <p>The comedian was given a 1-in-3 chance of living and was lucky to survive. He suffered severe burns that covered more than 50% of his body, according to People.<\/p> <p>Last year, while being interviewed by the documentary I Am Richard Pryor, Lee stated that the incident was a suicide attempt. She told People, \u201cHe warned me\u2026He said to me, \u2018I\u2019ve decided what to do. I have to do this otherwise I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get out.

Somebody answered and then the next thing I know they drop the phone and I heard someone screaming, and Richard at that time running through the house on fire.\u201d<\/p> <p>5.

The insurgent group must now govern a war-ravaged country that is heavily reliant on international aid.<\/p> <p>The women\u2019s march \u2014 the second in as many days in Kabul \u2014 began peacefully.

The Taliban official promised women would be given their rights but the women, all in their early 20s, were skeptical.<\/p> <p>As the demonstrators reached the presidential palace, a dozen Taliban special forces ran into the crowd, firing in the air and sending demonstrators fleeing.

But many Afghans, especially women, are deeply skeptical and fear a roll back of rights gained over the last two decades.<\/p> <p>For much of the past two weeks, Taliban officials have been holding meetings among themselves, amid reports of differences among them emerging. Early on Saturday, neighboring Pakistan\u2019s powerful intelligence chief Gen. Faiez Hameed made a surprise visit to Kabul. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what he had to say to the Taliban leadership but the Pakistani intelligence service has a strong influence on the Taliban.<\/p> <p>The Taliban leadership had its headquarters in Pakistan and were often said to be in direct contact with the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency. Although Pakistan routinely denied providing the Taliban military aid, the accusation was often made by the Afghan government and Washington.<\/p> <p>Faiez\u2019 visit comes as the world waits to see what kind of government the Taliban will eventually announce, seeking one that is inclusive and ensures protection of women\u2019s rights and the country\u2019s minorities.<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>The Taliban have promised a broad-based government and have held talks with former president Hamid Karzai and the former government\u2019s negotiation chief Abdullah Abdullah. But the makeup of the new government is uncertain and it was unclear whether hard-line ideologues among the Taliban will win the day \u2014 and whether the rollbacks feared by the demonstrating women will occur.<\/p> <p>Taliban members whitewashed murals Saturday that promoted health care, warned of the dangers of HIV and even paid homage to some of Afghanistan\u2019s iconic foreign contributors, like anthropologist Nancy Dupree, who singlehandedly chronicled Afghanistan\u2019s rich cultural legacy. It was a worrying sign of attempts to erase reminders of the past 20 years.<\/p> <p>The murals were replaced with slogans congratulating Afghans on their victory.<\/p> <p>A Taliban cultural commission spokesman, Ahmadullah Muttaqi, tweeted that the murals were painted over \u201cbecause they are against our values.

The say their fear is based on the stories they have heard of women not being allowed to go to school and work.<\/p> <p>Naiby, the 20-year-old, has already operated a women\u2019s organization and is a spokesperson for Afghanistan\u2019s Paralympics. She reflected on the tens of thousands of Afghans who rushed to Kabul\u2019s Hamid Karzai International Airport to escape Afghanistan after the Taliban overran the capital on Aug. 15.<\/p>

00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>They\u2019re selling Small Engine Repair as the new movie about toxic masculinity. It is that, but I think that\u2019s the wrong way to approach it, should you find yourself taking it in at either the AMC theater at Parks Mall or Movie Tavern Hulen this weekend. The better way to see it is as a stage play that has been effectively translated to film. I wish I saw more movies like this.<\/p> <p>Playwright John Pollono is the writer-director here, and he portrays Frank Romanowski, who runs a repair shop for lawnmowers and other small motor-powered devices in Manchester, N.H. He\u2019s an ex-convict with a daughter named Crystal (Ciara Bravo), who has been accepted early to UCLA. He\u2019s managed to stay out of prison for her, even though every time he goes out drinking with his buddies Swaino and Packie (Jon Bernthal and Shea Whigham), it ends in a bar fight. One evening, he invites the guys over to his shop for a night of steaks, expensive Scotch, and MMA on pay-per-view. They don\u2019t know that this gathering is a trap for one of Crystal\u2019s high-school friends, a powerful Boston lawyer\u2019s son (Spencer House) and a drug dealer who has slut-shamed her on Instagram after she was unwise enough to sext him naked pictures. Now she\u2019s lying in a coma after a suicide attempt, and Frank wants to spill this kid\u2019s blue blood all over the floor of his garage.<\/p> <p>Pollono\u2019s script is keen, if you can stomach all the casual racism, sexism, and homophobia flying around. (I went to an all-boys school, so I\u2019m well used to it.) Packie is the butt of much of this as the physically smallest of the three, but when a bartender tries to restrain him during a brawl, he takes a chunk out of the guy\u2019s arm with his teeth. There\u2019s violence in the air every time these guys gather, especially when Swaino badmouths Frank\u2019s ex-wife (Jordana Spiro) \u2014 who is a legitimately terrible parent \u2014 and dares him to bash in his head. Pollono has a good ear, not just for this, but also for the denigration that comes with male bonding, especially when Packie recalls their shared childhood experience of all being beaten by their dads after the Red Sox\u2019s epic loss in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. It\u2019s a traumatic story, and Packie can\u2019t stop laughing as he tells it.<\/p> <p>Pollono\u2019s direction isn\u2019t schematic and is only rarely stagy. My quarrel with it is that he makes a rookie mistake with the flashback sequences \u2014 it\u2019s usually more dramatic to keep the camera on the actor when he tells about the thing that once happened to him. Just because you can show it doesn\u2019t mean you necessarily should. However, this is a minor flaw and doesn\u2019t impede the flow of the story.<\/p> <p>Whigham is good as always and the director (who has a recurring role on TV\u2019s This Is Us) fits in well with his more seasoned fellow actors as a man whose anger issues are given the ultimate stress test. Still, it\u2019s Bernthal who walks away with the acting honors here. This short, powerfully built actor has showcased his fighting skills on TV\u2019s The Walking Dead and The Punisher, but the 44-year-old D.C. native has the goods even in roles that don\u2019t require him to fight, like the sensitive English teacher in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, the holdup man in Baby Driver, and Lee Iacocca in Ford v Ferrari. Here he\u2019s reprising a role that he originated on the stage 10 years ago, and he\u2019s somehow reassuring even while playing a character who\u2019s frequently out of control, especially in a climactic scene when he lays out a possible compromise solution that allows everyone to walk away.<\/p> <p>In the end, Small Engine Repair succeeds by keeping its ambitions in check. Who needs explosions, shootouts, or plot twists galore to make a good thriller? What this movie has is three guys who have another guy tied up, guys with criminal histories that fall well short of the step they\u2019re considering taking. They can\u2019t help but wonder whether they\u2019re doing the right thing. Can they avoid the consequences of letting this rich bastard walk, or the consequences of killing him? It\u2019s enough to hang a play or a film on, when it\u2019s done with this kind of skill.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"304QEQWKZRZHY5FQK1PWBSLXH330OM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":495,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"September","date":"8","city":"None","region":"None","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"racism, sexism, homophobia","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1266,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"movie watcher, plays, racism, sexism, homophobia","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":1646,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Crystal","victim_keywords":"Ciara Bravo, accepted early, UCLA, slut-shamed, Instagram, sext, naked pictures, coma, suicide attempt","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2021","city":null,"region":null,"date":"8","country":"United States","month":"September","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Crystal","victim_keywords":"Ciara Bravo, accepted early, UCLA, slut-shamed, Instagram, sext, naked pictures, coma, suicide attempt","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1034826226,"Input.title":"Week 6 on presidential campaign trail","Input.publish_date":"2022-03-20 05:32:39","Input.article_interface":"<p>MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Here are some of the highlights of Week 6 of the campaign of six of the presidential candidates.<\/p> <p>Leody de Guzman #2<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 13 \u2013 Continued sorties in Mindanao; met with urban poor, farmers, fisherfolk, youth groups in Lanao del Norte towns; dinner with Iligan City independent candidate for councilor Dominic Carillo.<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 14 \u2013 Spoke before youth supporters in Iligan; at online press conference of Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino, pushed for P750 minimum wage hike in Metro Manila and other regions.<\/p> <p>\u2013 Attended forum on energy in Iligan<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 15 \u2013 In Davao, held dialogue with women, farmers and workers groups in Wangan; attended Bibotante online forum of Polytechnic University of the Philippines-Quezon City<\/p> <p>\u2013 In a statement, said he remained unfazed by low score in latest Pulse Asia survey since his platforms were reaching wider audience<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 16 \u2013 Attended online forum held by Central Luzon State University in Mu\u00f1oz City, Nueva Ecija; met with children\u2019s rights groups in Ulas, Davao City<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 17 \u2013 Interviewed by radio station RNG Davao<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 18 \u2013 Took part in online forum on transportation held by Move as One Coalition<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 19 \u2013 Attended Commission on Elections (Comelec) presidential debate.<\/p> <p>Key message: \u201cQuality education does not only lead to high-paying jobs \u2026 [I]t is crucial in the overall development of the country, including economic, political, cultural and social, and in leading all Filipinos [to become] responsible citizens belonging to the community of nations \u2026 If we leave education in the hands of the private sector, it will not become a basic right [for all] but a privilege only for those who can afford it.\u201d (March 18 statement)<\/p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT<\/p> <p>\u2014JEROME ANING<\/p> <p>Isko Moreno Domagoso #3<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 13 \u2013 Kicked off three-day tour of Bicol, the bailiwick of Vice President Leni Robredo, starting in Masbate province<\/p> <p>\u25a0 March 14 \u2013 Continued wooing Bicolano voters in Sorsogon, skipping Robredo\u2019s hometown Naga City in Camarines Sur; was joined by late Sen.

The US Press Freedom Tracker, run by a coalition of press freedom advocacy groups, has currently documented at least 29 journalists who have been arrested or detained in the course of their reporting this year alone. (Some 15 journalists were detained by police while covering protests in Brooklyn Center, Minn., following the shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright by a police officer during a traffic stop in April.) Last year more than 400 journalists were assaulted here \u2014 just for doing their jobs \u2014 more than 100 reported having their equipment intentionally damaged while on the job, and 137 were arrested or detained.<\/p> <p>Compared to some dark corners of the world where journalists are thrown into a cell and never heard from again, this nation remains a bastion of freedom \u2014 where triumphs like the first-time gavel-to-gavel coverage of the Chauvin trial are still possible.

At the time, the announcement indicated hope that China could create a clean government\u2014free of bribery, crime, and other corruption endemic to the state\u2014like those of Hong Kong or Singapore. Over five years later, however, China\u2019s anticorruption campaign has fallen short, with no meaningful political reform in place and no long-term legal framework introduced to prevent corruption.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, Xi has continued to concentrate his power, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Chinese history. China\u2019s emerging civil society of NGOs, community groups, and social-advocacy organizations, which prospered under economic reform and modernization over the past three decades, now faces increasing government scrutiny. Dissent has been suppressed, making it harder for Chinese people to protest.<\/p> <p>I travelled throughout China as a reporter in 2012, the same year Xi launched his worldwide anti-graft campaign, presumably to cut down on political and private influence over public projects. Very often, I would hear ordinary Chinese citizens express their discontent with the one-party government and corrupt officials. \u201cThe country is dying from corruption and the widening wealth gap,\u201d a taxi driver who gave me a ride in Chongqing said, something echoed by Xi himself, who said, \u201cWe must . . . rid ourselves of any virus that erodes the party\u2019s health.\u201d<\/p> <p>For some in China, 2012 was a year of prosperity; for others, the wealth gap only widened. After over three decades of economic and social reforms, China\u2019s gross domestic product reached about $8.5 trillion (US), according to the World Bank, making it the second largest GDP in the world. However, its income inequality was also among the world\u2019s worst. A 2015 report found the wealthiest 1 percent of Chinese households owned a third of the country\u2019s wealth, while the poorest quarter owned just 1 percent. China\u2019s Gini coefficient, a widely used measure of income inequality, was 0.422 in 2012, according to the World Bank. A coefficient above 0.4 is generally considered a warning sign of income inequality.<\/p> <p>Many people were unhappy about the disparity. The media reported 382 worker strikes in China in 2012, according to data from Hong Kong\u2013based NGO China Labour Bulletin. Many of them were protesting arrears of wages and long working hours. But these issues were only the tip of the iceberg. In time, Chinese citizens held hundreds of protests objecting to issues such as the polluted environment, rising house prices, lack of food safety, and political suffocation\u2014most of which have their roots in corruption. Then, Xi replaced Hu Jintao as president.<\/p> <p>In contrast to his predecessor, Xi came from a prominent political family. He was a \u201cprinceling\u201d\u2014the descendant of a powerful Communist Party figure, Xi Zhongxun, who later became a vice-premier. Xi followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, and his steady rise to power was possibly helped by his connection to other princelings and their families, who hold key roles in government departments, state enterprises, and financial institutions. Being a princeling may have also enabled Xi to take extreme reform measures within the party and launch his so-called war on corruption.<\/p> <p>To understand how corruption works in China, one needs to understand its politics and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). China became a one-party country ruled by the CCP in 1949. A seven-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), whose members also hold senior posts in other top leadership bodies, is the most powerful decision-making body in the party. One member of the PSC is the secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party\u2019s top anti-graft body and one of the most feared institutions in the country. But the nature of the CCDI has made it, too, potentially susceptible to corruption.<\/p> <p>For example, the CCDI is responsible for enforcing Xi\u2019s campaign to sanction officials for \u201cserious violations of party discipline,\u201d a subtle Chinese phrase referring to acts of corruption. The CCDI oversees a group of lower-level disciplinary officials. Cases brought forward by the CCDI are rarely overruled by the judicial system, which is not independent from the government administration in China.<\/p> <p>The CCDI recently announced that, in 2017, 527,000 people were given discipline violations ranging from warnings and demotions to expulsion from the CCP and removal from office. \u201cAmong them,\u201d reports The Diplomat, a current-affairs magazine for the Asia-Pacific region, \u201c58 were officials at the provincial and ministerial level or higher. The CCDI also revealed that about 48,000 officials were investigated or prosecuted for severe violations of discipline and suspected criminal activity.\u201d<\/p> <p>However, the procedure for investigating a suspected corrupt official is neither standard nor transparent. Officials from the secretive, powerful agency have the ultimate authority to decide who should be targeted and undergo investigation. They can imprison suspected officials for months without a warrant and question them with evidence seized from beatings, sleep deprivation, or anonymous tips. The primary job of the agency is inspections.<\/p> <p>Teams from the CCDI conduct surprise inspections of provincial departments and state-owned enterprises. They often work out of makeshift offices at local hotels for months, where they meet with dozens of low- and mid-level officials who have been targeted.<\/p> <p>There is an old saying: absolute power corrupts absolutely. The CCDI has grown into the country\u2019s most powerful institution by enforcing Xi\u2019s anticorruption campaign. It became so omnipotent that the CCP decided investigators needed to be reined in and face \u201chigher self-discipline.\u201d \u201cA total of 22 officials with the [CCDI] . . . have been investigated, and about 230 officials have received written or oral warnings since the 18th CCP National Congress in late 2012,\u201d China\u2019s state media Xinhua reported in 2018. \u201cDuring the same period,\u201d the Xinhua article added, \u201cmore than 10,000 officials serving at various levels in Discipline Inspection agencies were punished.\u201d<\/p> <p>One consistent paradox in modern Chinese history is that worsening corruption has not seemed to slow China\u2019s economic growth\u2014at least not yet.<\/p> <p>The People\u2019s Republic of China was founded, in 1949, on the nationalization of land and resources by dividing the farmland of local tyrants (da tuhao, fen tiandi). In the late 1970s, when the Chinese government began to liberalize its economic policies, which allowed individuals to own businesses, the scale of corruption increased dramatically\u2014the liberalization policy enabled government officials to cash in on their ability to manipulate the allocation of national resources of land and capital.<\/p> <p>At its core, corruption in China revolves around the concept of guanxi, which roughly translates to \u201crelationships\u201d or \u201cconnections.\u201d Guanxi is a Chinese practice of cultivating personal relations with influential people\u2014the term itself doesn\u2019t always indicate corrupt behaviour. Today, individuals seek favours from bureaucrats and officials to allow them to slip through the back door (zou houmen) to obtain state resources, government projects, green lights to pollute, admissions to elite schools, or jobs in government departments. The effects of guanxi on corrupt dealings is perpetuated by a lack of law, regulations, and transparency.<\/p> <p>Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping famously described economic reform as \u201ccrossing the river by feeling stones\u201d (mo zhe shi tou guo he), to show that reform policies were adaptable and flexible. Those flexible policies also left room for corruption to flourish and evolve. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chinese corruption was very different from what it has become. Corrupt officials mostly worked alone. But, by 1995, corruption became organized. Officials in one department or even one region began to form close networks and work cooperatively. (The Guangdong Maoming case, in 2012, is a classic example: according to reports from the South China Morning Post, a single corruption case in the city of Maoming involved more than 300 officials taking bribes for favours.)<\/p> <p>Corruption in China has now evolved from organized corruption to institutionalized corruption. Throughout the late 1990s, governments began to incorporate corruption into their official policies and institutions. Today, corruption has become so rampant that an official charged with taking thousands of yuan is regarded as a reasonable official who may be considered someone who at least does not take too many bribes. In 1994, 1,915 high-level officials were charged with corruption, and the total amount of money involved in these cases totalled 3.4 billion yuan (over $629 million). In 2007, the number of high-level officials prosecuted had jumped to 2,706, and the assets involved had roughly doubled to 6.7 billion yuan (over $1.24 billion).<\/p> <p>Despite the government\u2019s ongoing anticorruption campaign, old habits die hard. Xi has a trusted circle of friends who are relatively safe from investigations. The penalty for bribery under Chinese law ranges from fines to the confiscation of property to imprisonment to, in some cases, the death penalty. Yet public officials, corporate executives, and others who offer bribes often escape punishment altogether.<\/p> <p>Soon after Xi started his anticorruption policies in 2012, he ordered a series of crackdowns on China\u2019s growing civil society. The CCP has put human rights lawyers in jail, suppressed internet freedom, closed unauthorized churches, arrested outspoken labour activists, and integrated party organizations into enterprises and universities. The government has also begun to establish an Orwellian \u201csocial credit\u201d system, where individuals relinquish their privacy through increased government surveillance in the name of national security. These crackdowns have severely damaged civil society in China.<\/p> <p>The Chinese government has also restricted the media\u2019s right to report on critical issues across the country. An unofficial rule that allowed journalists to expose corrupt officials in provinces other than where the media organization was based has been abolished under Xi\u2019s administration. It was replaced with stricter media regulations and more severe censorship, making it difficult for civil society to monitor or expose corruption. Many journalists, bloggers, and human rights activists were arrested and forced to confess without a fair trial or any due process. According to Reporters Without Borders, more than 100 journalists and bloggers are currently being detained.<\/p> <p>In 2018, China entered the sixth year of its anticorruption drive. According to the CCDI itself, authorities have registered about 1.16 million corruption cases, and 1.14 million officials at or below township level have been punished since the 18th National Congress in 2012. At least 240 senior officials have also been investigated. After a three-day closed-door meeting on of the CCDI in early January 2018, it identified the banking industry as a critical area of corruption, foreshadowing future anticorruption storms in the financial sector. It is standard practice for state leaders and their princeling children to hire princelings to secure financial deals and build relationships with powerful families.<\/p> <p>During a critical meeting last year, Xi called for more anticorruption efforts to \u201cfundamentally improve the political ecosystem of the [CCP].\u201d So far, regardless of worthwhile questions about its political motivations and sincerity, the anticorruption campaign has strengthened Xi\u2019s power. But, if it is to become a lasting political legacy, more needs to be done from the government\u2019s side.

This was despite an international United Nations warrant for his arrest which all UN members were obliged to implement. Nor had Pretoria even placed him under surveillance. As a result, he escaped from South Africa a year ago and has yet not been found.<\/p> <p>The IRMCT was created in 2010 to take over and complete outstanding cases from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \u2013 and the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \u2013 as their mandates were expiring.<\/p> <p>The prosecutor\u2019s unusually blunt report to the UN Security Council about South Africa\u2019s unhelpful attitude has been described by one diplomatic source as \u201can astonishing indictment of a country which prides itself on upholding international justice\u201d.<\/p> <p>Brammertz said in his annual report to the Security Council that Kayishema \u201cremains at large following South Africa\u2019s failure to provide effective cooperation over the last two and a half years\u201d. Pretoria\u2019s failures included refusing to arrest Kayishema on grounds that he had been given refugee status. But later the Department of Home Affairs claimed that it had lost his refugee file and his fingerprints which the tribunal needed to confirm his identity.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy Office alleges that Kayishema, the local police inspector, played an important role in the 16 April 1994 massacre at Nyange Church,\u201d Brammertz said.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn the days leading up to the massacre, 2,000 Tutsi civilians \u2013 women, men, children and elderly \u2013 sought refuge in the church.<\/p> <p>\u201cInitially, militias surrounded the church and launched an attack, including throwing hand grenades into the packed building. While many were wounded and killed, the refugees resisted, forcing the attackers to retreat.<\/p> <p>\u201cDetermined to murder these innocent civilians, local leaders, including Kayishema, brought a bulldozer to the church grounds. In an act of unimaginable brutality and sacrilege, the bulldozer was used to demolish the church with the refugees still inside. More than 1,500 were crushed to death. Survivors who escaped were hunted down and killed. Kayishema fled from justice, and remained a fugitive for years. \u201c<\/p> <p>\u201cBut almost three years ago, my Office finally located him. Relying on records and sources, my Office concluded in early 2018 that Kayishema was living in Cape Town, South Africa. This was confirmed by South African authorities via INTERPOL in August 2018. We immediately submitted an urgent request for assistance to South Africa seeking his prompt arrest.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo we were surprised to be informed that because Kayishema had been granted refugee status in South Africa, he could not be handed over to the Mechanism. This excuse was withdrawn months later, replaced with a new argument that South Africa lacked a legal basis to cooperate with the Mechanism.<\/p> <p>\u201cAfter sixteen months of intense negotiations, in December 2019, South Africa finally submitted the UN arrest warrant for execution, which a local magistrate approved. However, by then, Kayishema could no longer be found. It is important to note that my Office has reliable information that Kayishema was present in South Africa as late as October and November 2019, so merely weeks before South Africa reported in the Security Council that the arrest operation was unsuccessful.<\/p> <p>\u201dLittle has improved since. A year ago, after the failed arrest, my Office submitted an extensive request for assistance detailing information we required to continue the pursuit of Kayishema. Yet our request still has not been satisfactorily answered.<\/p> <p>\u201cTwo months ago in October, it was agreed that my Office would send a technical team to Pretoria to finally receive the requested material. The foreign affairs and justice ministries convened a number of joint meetings with responsible officials.<\/p> <p>\u201cBut the Department of Home Affairs, which has responsibility for key information, did not attend as scheduled. My Office was then again requested to send last week another mission to specifically meet with the Department of Home Affairs and receive outstanding documents. To our great surprise, on the last day of the mission, Home Affairs representatives informed us that Kayishema\u2019s refugee file and fingerprints do not exist. This is difficult to understand. \u201c<\/p> <p>Brammertz told the UN Security Council that he was reporting these facts \u201c to explain why, despite all my Office\u2019s efforts, Kayishema remains at large.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe situation raises many questions. How can it be that South Africa refused to arrest Kayishema two and a half years ago based on a refugee file that it is now claimed doesn\u2019t exist? And why didn\u2019t authorities take obvious measures after being informed that an internationally wanted fugitive indicted for genocide was present in their country?<\/p> <p>\u201cDespite a UN warrant calling for Kayishema\u2019s immediate arrest, South African authorities did not provisionally detain him or put him under any surveillance to prevent his escape.\u201d<\/p> <p>Brammertz added that it was now most important was to move forward and finally arrest Kayishema. He appealed directly to South Africa\u2019s representative in the Security Council \u2013 where South Africa has been serving as a temporary member for the last two years \u2013 to finally help his tribunal find Kayishema.<\/p> <p>\u201cEmpower your operational services \u2013 particularly police and prosecutors \u2013 to work directly with us on a day-to-day basis. And truly give them your full political and diplomatic support, as well as the resources they require to help us. I am prepared to visit Pretoria in the new year to discuss our further cooperation and agree on a clear joint strategy and operational arrangements. This would also send the right message to other capitals\u201d.<\/p> <p>Daily Maverick asked both the Department of International Relations and Cooperation and the Department of Justice and Correction Services for comment but after several hours neither had responded.<\/p> <p>Darren Bergman, the spokesperson for international relations and cooperation of the Democratic Alliance said:<\/p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately the Government of South Africa believes in loyalty before the Constitution. When it comes to international relations and cooperation the name has been misleading for years as we have been anything but cooperative to the likes of world organizations that we pay hefty membership fees to sit on.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe continue to embarrass ourselves and show that certain individuals\u2019 lives matter more than mass lives in hypocritical ways that leave the international community continuously confused and frustrated at us. This has an impact on tourism, foreign investment and long term relationships.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to the website of Brammerz\u2019s tribunal, of the 90 persons originally indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTR) on Rwanda, six remain at large. Of these, Protais Mpiranya has been earmarked for trial by the Mechanism. The ICTR Prosecutor has requested referrals to Rwanda for trial in the cases of the five other fugitives: Kayishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, Ryandikayo (first name unknown) and Ph\u00e9n\u00e9as Munyarugarama.<\/p> <p>At the start of 2020 there were two more fugitives at large. But in May 2020, DNA tests established that one of the most wanted killers, Augustin Bizimana, the defence minister at the time of the genocide and one of the kingpins of the extermination of Tutsis, had died in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo, in 2000.<\/p> <p>And F\u00e9licien Kabuga was arrested in France on 16 May 2020, \u201cfollowing an intensive analysis of telecommunications and other data\u2026 thanks to efficient cooperation from French authorities,\u201d Brammertz told the UN Security Council last week. He added that the tribunal was progressing with preparations for Kabuga\u2019s trial and he had already appeared in court at The Hague on 11 November this year.<\/p> <p>The UN has offered up to US$5 million as a reward for information leading to the arrests of any of the remaining fugitives.<\/p> <p>Brammertz was also critical of the Zimbabwean and Ugandan governments for their failures to cooperate fully with his tribunal in pursuing fugitives, though he did not identify which one or ones.<\/p> <p>Brammertz said he intended to travel soon to Harare for further discussions with the government there:<\/p> <p>\u201cTo move cooperation in the right direction, we would expect to see a more pro-active approach by the Zimbabwean Task Force.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn this regard, effective investigations would need to begin with the acknowledgment that a fugitive is known to have sheltered in Zimbabwe and has deep, long-standing connections with Zimbabwean persons.<\/p> <p>\u201cSimilarly, my team and I will need to return again to Kampala to engage in open and frank discussions about the urgent steps needed to remedy long-standing issues. Authorities have acknowledged that a fugitive obtained an official Ugandan passport, but our requests for investigation records and access to persons of interest have not been answered after more than a year.\u201d DM<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"3EAWOID6MVCCOPONLDBA6KF5DWZV0I"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":617,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["killing","other","torture"],"year":"1994","month":"April","date":"16","city":"None","region":"None","country":"South Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"church, civilians, massacre, crushed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":932,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"1994","month":"04","date":"16","city":"None","region":"None","country":"South Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Nyange Church, massacre, refugees","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":3241,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"1994","month":"04","date":"16","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"women, men, children, elderly, innocent civilians, refugees, church, More than 1,500 crushed to death, 2,000 Tutsi","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"1994","city":null,"region":null,"date":"16","country":"South Africa","month":"04","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["killing","other","torture"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"women, men, children, elderly, innocent civilians, refugees, church, More than 1,500 crushed to death, 2,000 Tutsi","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":970443629,"Input.title":"Activists demand Calif.

The graphic, which urged Frugoli to \u201cDrop the Charges,\u201d was also emblazoned with the phrase \u201cno more monuments to murderers.\u201d<\/p> <p>The petition suggests that the monument's destruction was justified because Serra was \u201ca notoriously violent mission leader known for imprisoning and enslaving Indigenous people.\u201d It also slammed the city of San Rafael for \u201crefusing to recognize the harms perpetrated against Indigenous people\u201d and maintained that \u201cthis is a critical moment to resist increasing repression and support decolonial activists in your community.\u201d<\/p> <p>As of Thursday afternoon, the petition had garnered more than 75,420 signatures out of a goal of 150,000.<\/p> <p>Statues of the 18th century priest were targeted because of his ties to Spanish expansion in North America. In 1769, Serra led the first group of missionaries into California.<\/p> <p>In addition to calling on Frugoli to drop the charges against the \u201cIndigenous People\u2019s Day 5,\u201d the petition offered additional suggestions on how to help support the aforementioned protesters. These tips included a call to \u201cencourage Mission San Rafael to consider how they might begin to reconcile with the violence of their founding\u201d and \u201clearn about the history of the land you are on, learn about the Indigenous People it was stolen from, (and) find a way to recognize your place in this lineage and contribute to its healing.\u201d<\/p> <p>A letter written by a group called The Indigenous Peoples Day 5 Coalition accuses Frugoli of \u201ctargeting \u201c \"Indigenous women and two Spirited People.\" According to the signatories, the charging of the five protesters constitutes a \u201ccontinuation of the legacy of anti-Indigenous violence that persists to this day.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cBy charging only Indigenous people, you are aligning yourself with the dangerous trend toward repression of BIPOC activists and those speaking up against violent, genocidal figures such as Junipero Serra,\u201d they wrote in part.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is the moment to take a stance in support of recognizing that the removal of this statute was in and of itself a response to the brutal and racist violence that is central to Junipero Serra\u2019s legacy. We are writing to urge you to act in accordance with your own stated values, those of standing against racism in Marin, and drop the charges now against the Indigenous Peoples Day 5,\u201d the letter continued.<\/p> <p>More than 40 groups and individuals signed the letter, including First Congressional Church in Ripon, California, University of California Davis professor Erin Gray, the Ohio Women\u2019s Alliance and CodePink Women for Peace, East Bay Chapter. The website for the Indigenous Peoples Day 5 Solidarity Coalition described Serra as a \u201cmurderous abuser of Indigenous people, notorious for imprisoning and enslaving Indigenous people in what is now known as California.\u201d<\/p> <p>Last summer, Bishop Robert Barron of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles delivered a homily defending Serra's legacy. \u201cDo you know in 1773, Junipero Serra made his way, of course, by foot, in constant pain from Carmel all the way to Mexico City to argue for a bill of rights for the Native peoples?\u201d he asked.<\/p> <p>Barron also pushed back on the depiction of \u201cevangelization as some sort of cultural aggression,\u201d explaining that \u201cSerra wanted to share what he quite rightly took to be the most precious give you could ever give.\u201d<\/p> <p>Similarly, the California Catholic Conference of Bishops and Salvatore Cordileone, the archbishop of San Francisco, said critics of the saint were making false claims that he was involved in the genocide of indigenous people.<\/p> <p>\"St. Serra made heroic sacrifices to protect the Indigenous people of California from their Spanish conquerors, especially the soldiers,\" Cordileone said in a statement released in July. \"Even with his infirmed leg which caused him such pain, he walked all the way to Mexico City to obtain special faculties of governance from the Viceroy of Spain in order to discipline the military who were abusing the Indians. And then he walked back to California.<\/p> <p>\"And lest there be any doubt, we have a physical reminder to this day: everywhere there is a presidio (soldiers\u2019 barracks) associated with a mission in the chain of 21 missions that he founded, the presidio is miles away from the mission itself and the school. St. Junipero Serra also offered them the best thing he had: the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ, which he and his fellow Franciscan friars did through education, health care, and training in the agrarian arts, he added.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"3TZ0XG8CBWZW97GNDGJT7HWQ52T893"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":755,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2020","month":"October","date":"12","city":"San Rafael","region":"California","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"five protestors, Indgenous women, arrested, repression","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":290,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"October","date":"11","city":"San Rafael","region":"California","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"activists, indigenous, California, protest, Catholic","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1043,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2020","month":null,"date":null,"city":"San Rafael","region":"California","country":"USA","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"activists, Junipero Serra statue, rioters, vandalism, indigenous women","victim_type":["human rights defender","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2020","city":"San Rafael","region":"California","date":"11","country":"United States","month":"October","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"activists, indigenous, California, protest, Catholic","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1039465128,"Input.title":"Palestinian terrorist affiliated with ISIS killed Jerusalem couple, Moldovan worker","Input.publish_date":"2022-04-14 19:27:39","Input.article_interface":"<p>A Palestinian terrorist affiliated with the ideology of the Islamic State (ISIS) stabbed three people to death in Jerusalem between January 2019 and March of this year, and also attempted to murder a teenager, Israeli security forces announced on Thursday.

musician fighting Poland's blasphemy laws","Input.publish_date":"2021-03-18 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Blasphemy rather comes with the territory in the world of extreme metal. Since Venom proclaimed themselves In League With Satan in 1981, antagonising Christianity has been more or less compulsory to any extreme band worth its brimstone, though this has historically tended not to result in anything more than fulmination from a pulpit.<\/p> <p>But not in Poland, where last month, Nergal, the leader of the successful quartet Behemoth \u2013 whose album The Satanist cracked the US Top 40 in 2014 \u2013 was convicted of blasphemy after posting a photo on social media of him treading on an image of the Virgin Mary. He\u2019s appealing, but if the conviction is upheld he faces a fine at least, possible imprisonment, and a criminal record that will make international touring difficult.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is my Instagram. This is my realm. And I\u2019m just letting myself be myself within my realm,\u201d Nergal says. \u201cIt\u2019s a supposed Virgin Mary painting, because you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Virgin Mary, do you? You see the context, but you don\u2019t know. And you see the boot. That\u2019s all you see. It\u2019s not like there are 10 people around me saying, \u2018Hey, Nergal, what should we do to bring some attention to you?\u2019 Because I don\u2019t need that attention.\u201d<\/p> <p>Indeed, Nergal is no stranger to controversy. While he is critical of Poland\u2019s rightwing administration, he has been accused of being a far-right supporter himself, which he has denied. In 2017, after the Rock am Ring festival was evacuated owing to a terrorist threat, he told an interviewer: \u201cThe civilised world is at war with radical Islamists, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d In 2018 he was pictured with the far-right Polish musician Rob Darken, later saying \u201cI don\u2019t condone Rob\u2019s personal ideals and agenda because I don\u2019t know them\u201d, and was criticised last year for posting an image of a T-shirt with the legend \u201cblack metal against Antifa\u201d, later saying: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about damage [Antifa] make to the scene. The ideals are OK, but the execution of them is utterly incompetent.\u201d Even being charged with blasphemy is not a new experience: in 2010, he was charged in relation to an incident in 2007, in which he tore up a Bible on stage (the charges were dropped). And this case, he says, is one of three he is fighting simultaneously; it\u2019s just the one he happens to have been convicted of.<\/p> <p>Nergal\u2019s case is one of a rising tide of blasphemy prosecutions in Poland, often targeted at artists. In the past couple of years, with the rightwing Law and Justice party in power, the number of blasphemy prosecutions has doubled: 29 indictments were filed in 2020, against 10 in 2016. They are brought under article 196 of the country\u2019s penal code, which demands prosecution of \u201cwhoever offends the religious feelings of other persons by publicly insulting an object of religious worship, or a place designated for public religious ceremonies\u201d.<\/p> <p>As Nergal notes, the wording is meaninglessly vague: \u201cIn court I am asking, is there a thermometer of religious beliefs? Because if there is, just give me one and I will stick it up my ass and know when I am hitting some limit. But I don\u2019t know where it is, because you are so sensitive and fragile. If they win all these cases, it will make it easy for these people to point at anything and go: \u2018You know what? That hurts my religious beliefs.\u2019\u201d Moreover, it doesn\u2019t require widespread offence: just four people complained about Nergal\u2019s Instagram post. \u201cWhy are you entering my social media to get offended? They are opportunists, who want to capitalise on my back, because they know I\u2019m an easy target and when they bring me to court they get headlines the next day \u2013 I\u2019m their favourite scapegoat.\u201d<\/p> <p>Behemoth performing live. Photograph: Grzegorz Go\u0142\u0119biowski<\/p> <p>It\u2019s easy to write this off as trivial, but blasphemy laws are important, says Jessica N\u00ed Mhain\u00edn, policy and campaigns manager at Index on Censorship: \u201cThe right to blaspheme, to speak irreverently, or against a prevalent dogma is an essential part of our freedom of expression. Laws that prohibit offending someone else\u2019s religious feelings do not protect freedom of religion, they unduly curtail free speech.\u201d<\/p> <p>While many other countries maintain blasphemy laws, only Poland among European nations displays any interest in enforcing them. \u201cBlasphemy laws are completely incompatible with international conventions on freedom of expression, and human rights experts and organisations the world over continue to call for them to be repealed,\u201d N\u00ed Mhain\u00edn says. \u201cInternational law embraces even expression that may be regarded as deeply offensive, including blasphemy.\u201d<\/p> <p>Poland\u2019s ministry of justice takes a different view, arguing the European court accepts that freedom of expression may be subject to restrictions and \u201ccarries with it obligations and responsibilities which depend on the circumstances and manner of expression,\u201d a spokesperson for the ministry tells the Guardian via email.<\/p> <p>On the specific offence of blasphemy, the ministry adds: \u201cSuch statements do not enrich the public debate, nor do they lead to the development of tolerance or respect for human dignity, which are the basis of a democratic and pluralist society. The state may therefore deem it necessary to take measures to repress certain forms of expression. This is justified especially in the case of a deliberate violation of the spirit of tolerance, when, for example, the object of religious worship has been deliberately and maliciously presented in a provocative manner.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, this must be set within a wider context. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland\u2019s prime minister, has been open about his desire for a \u201cculture war\u201d to defend Catholic values. In December 2017, he told the Catholic broadcaster Radio Maryja: \u201cWe want to transform Europe, this is my dream, to re-Christianise it. We want Poland to be strong, but also to contain ... Christian values. We will defend them against the background of laicisation and a deepening consumerism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Poland\u2019s blasphemy laws matter because they are part of a wider attack on human rights. A recent blasphemy case saw LGBTQ+ activists charged for giving an image of the Virgin Mary a rainbow halo (they won their case, which Nergal sees as a sign of hope). Law and Justice is committed to fighting LBGTQ+ ideology; and earlier this year the government enforced a near-total abortion ban. Nergal sees all these things as interrelated.<\/p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m their favourite scapegoat\u2019 ... Nergal performing live. Photograph: Grzegorz Go\u0142\u0119biowski<\/p> <p>\u201cYou can smell that it\u2019s not really about spirituality here; it\u2019s all about a very shallow tradition and political power,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what Polish Catholicism has always been about. It was just about the tradition; it\u2019s a facade. It\u2019s an elephant on porcelain legs. This case, and the women\u2019s rights, and the LGBT thing, they are all about the violation of human rights on so many levels. And one of the levels is my department.\u201d<\/p> <p>The abortion ban was opposed by a majority of Poles, and provoked mass demonstrations earlier this year. The arrest of the LGBTQ+ activist Margot last year also led to protests, which saw 48 people arrested in what has become nicknamed \u201cPoland\u2019s Stonewall\u201d. Nergal, though, has to stand alone: extreme metal singers tend to scare people off. One Polish music star who has been vocal about abortion and LGBTQ+ rights refused to comment for this piece, saying: \u201cThe main topic and the main character of the article is really controversial.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Polish Catholic church is facing deep problems. There have been repeated scandals involving child abuse by priests, and subsequent cover-ups. There have been enough people leaving the church that the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics has announced an investigation into the departures. Fascinatingly, Google searches for \u201capostasy\u201d are at an all-time high in Poland.<\/p> <p>All of which gives Nergal hope. \u201cIt is amazing to see that Catholic society being disoriented: \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 It will eventually put the church where it belongs \u2013 it should be like the Czech Republic, where if you want it you go and practise your stuff. But that\u2019s where you belong \u2013 don\u2019t enter my life with your dirty boots, because I\u2019ve never asked you to do so.\u201d<\/p> <p>It would be easy to paint this as a generational divide: just 9% of young Poles now take a positive view of the Catholic church. However, it\u2019s not quite so simple, Nergal warns. \u201cI would like to think that\u2019s the case, but then we have the dangerous growth of rightwing sympathisers. A lot of them call themselves patriots, and they mix up all these dangerous philosophies that are nationalistic and xenophobic, anti-this and anti-that, anti-LGBT, no foreigners.\u201d<\/p> <p>Nergal is now taking the fight to his opponents. He has launched a crowdfunder to raise money for his defence, and any surplus will go towards the social justice campaigns kicking back against the state\u2019s imposition of hardline Catholic values. \u201cI am part of that anti-government tide, that massive wave of people saying: \u2018Fuck no. You\u2019re not going to make us slaves to your agenda. You\u2019re not going to make it a Catholic state.\u2019 We are talking about a bigger thing than a musician facing a legal problem: if you want to evolve as a country, you must go secular.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"3O4VWC1GEYLZEMNQNBFA5U2ILLD3J1"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":461,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"February","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Poland","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Nergal","victim_keywords":"Poland, musician, Catholicism, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":732,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2010","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Poland","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Nergal","victim_keywords":"leader, quartet, blasphemy, charged, possible imprisonment","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"1f400fe4-8bb5-413a-ba43-1c46576aeb51","work_time_in_seconds":433,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"March","date":"18","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Poland","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Nergal","victim_keywords":"Poland, blasphemy, Nergal, Behemoth, Virgin Mary, Catholic, Morawiecki,","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2021","city":null,"region":null,"date":"18","country":"Poland","month":"February","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Nergal","victim_keywords":"Poland, musician, Catholicism, free speech","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":885053861,"Input.title":"Pedro X.

It was part of the event, \u201cMedia and Democracy in Times of Digital Cholera and Polarization in Latin America,\u201d hosted by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas and LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections.<\/p> <p>The position the country is in now did not start on April 2018, as Molina explains it.<\/p> <p>\u201cFor more than a decade, we have experienced a continuous erosion of all our fundamental civil and human rights in Nicaragua, including electoral fraud, a corrupt justice system, a criminal Congress and an executive power whose only function is to remain in power no matter what,\u201d Molina said. \u201cElectoral fraud, repression, corruption, abuse and killings have been rising steadily for a decade. It\u2019s not something that just exploded last year.\u201d<\/p> <p>Yet, demonstrations took hold in the country following a proposed reform to the social security law more than one year ago.<\/p> <p>One of those killed during the protests was Angel Gahona, a journalist killed with a single bullet to the head while broadcasting on Facebook Live.<\/p> <p>As things got worse for the general public, so did the situation for independent journalists.<\/p> <p>\u201cJournalists were harassed, beaten, and robbed in the streets by the forces of the regime,\u201d Molina said. \u201cRadio stations were burned and newspapers started having problems printing their daily editions because the government wouldn\u2019t let them import the paper and ink they needed. The most visible journalists received threats of jail and death through social media.\u201d<\/p> <p>In December 2018, police forces raided the newsroom of digital site Confidencial, which publishes Molina\u2019s work, and took computers, cameras, etc.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe next day, the journalists found themselves borrowing computers so that they could denounce the aggression,\u201d Molina said. \u201cSince we were still producing content for the people, Ortega and Murillo weren\u2019t happy. Somehow they were thinking that by taking away our equipment, we will stop reporting what was happening. But we didn\u2019t, of course. Things no longer work like in the 70s.\u201d<\/p> <p>The police came back the next day, occupied the building and are still there today.<\/p> <p>A week later, the police forces raided independent TV station 100% Noticias and arrested the owner of the station and news director, charging them with promotion of terrorism, as Molina explained.<\/p> <p>\u201cBy that time, it was pretty obvious that the government was hunting down independent journalists. The level of the threats many of us were getting went up. Now they were not only threatening us with jail or death, but they were also starting to mention details about our private lives and our families.\u201d<\/p> <p>About 60 independent journalists have had to leave the country, many of them continuing to work outside the country.<\/p> <p>To do the critical work he does, Molina found a home at digital site Confidencial. This happened prior to the April 2018 protests.<\/p> <p>\u201cI am able to keep doing this because I found myself a spot in a strong, determined group of people with whom I can do this kind of thing. It\u2019s very important for us to get together and try to find ourselves with other people who are thinking alike and really, really trying to make a difference.\u201d<\/p> <p>As Molina explained, he joined the site after leaving print newspaper El Nuevo Diario following its sale to people who did not want to attract the ire of the government and who therefore asked him to not draw about it.<\/p> <p>Cartoonist Pedro X. Molina and radio producer Joy D\u00edaz discuss media in Nicaragua. (Teresa Mioli\/Knight Center)<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople ask me if things are cooling down in Nicaragua right now,\u201d Molina said. \u201cMy answer is that things are even worse now.\u201d<\/p> <p>Protesters cannot go out into the street, killings are still happening and political prisoners are harassed. As far as the independent press, El Nuevo Diario had to close because of a lack of printing materials. Print newspaper La Prensa was forced to change its format and reduce page count. Additionally, independent journalists are still being physically attacked.<\/p> <p>\u201cEveryday, things get worse in Nicaragua while the world seems to forget a little more about it,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Joy D\u00edaz, producer of the radio show Texas Standard and moderator of a talk with Molina, pointed out similarities between Nicaragua and the U.S. and asked how the latter country might learn from the former.<\/p> <p>\u201cBy trying to care about what is happening down there. People over here, I have a feeling that they just care about \u2018this will cause more people to get into the States\u2019 and that\u2019s it,\u201d Molina said.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t care about anything else. They don\u2019t care about why these people are leaving their countries and trying to come here. And they are only focused on trying to stop those people.\u201d<\/p> <p>D\u00edaz also asked Molina what he would like to be remembered for.<\/p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about people remembering me. What I do want people to remember is maybe my work or the reason I do my work,\u201d Molina said. \u201cThis idea of being free, of being able to say whatever you want about the society in which you live, and don\u2019t take anything for granted. To be very skeptical and very critical of everything we see and care about each other and care about politics.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"371DNNCG46HFTMP1BMOAYHX2Z9VT8N"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":936,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2018","month":"April","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Angel Gahona","victim_keywords":"journalist, killed, bullet to the head","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, harrassed, beaten, robbed, jail, death","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"people, protests, killed","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"worker_id":"24528428-dbe4-46d7-bd43-27324cef42f6","work_time_in_seconds":299,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other"],"year":"2018","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Angel Gahona","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1161,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2018","month":"04","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nicaragua","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Pedro X.

Onslow Assistant DA Kaelyn Sweet, who is the main prosecutor for sex offense and child abuse cases in the county, represented the state.<\/p> <p>During the trial, evidence showed on June 8, 2018, the victim reported to Onslow County Sheriff Detective Lindsay Kensington that pictures and videos of her performing sexual acts had been sent to her employer at Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune through Facebook.<\/p> <p>The pictures and videos had been created between her and Stokes during their previous relationship as the victim expected them to remain private. Evidence also showed between June 2018 and Nov. 2020, Stokes created more than 11 fictitious profiles in order to post the content to social media.<\/p> <p>Each post contained the full name of the victim, and many posts also contained her home address and employer information.<\/p> <p>ADA Sweet also provided additional evidence showing Stokes slashed the victim's tires on two separate occasions and also broke into her home to take pictures of a gun in her bedroom. The pictures were then posted on social media.<\/p> <p>Stokes continued telling his ex-girlfriend he would keep posting the private content until he felt satisfied that she was just as embarrassed as he was after she ended their relationship, prior to law enforcement becoming involved in the matter. The state presented evidence of those conversations, as well as photographs and social media records in addition to the testimony offered during the trial, including that of the victim.<\/p> <p>The defendant offered evidence from an Onslow County Civil District Court Clerk and his oldest brother, Robert Stokes. The court recorded the verdict of each charge even though Stokes was not present during the reading.<\/p> <p>Once Stokes has been found, the judge has ordered he will be held under no bond pending sentencing.

The horrific violence, perpetrated by Hindu nationalist forces owing allegiance to the supremacist ideology of Hindutva, claimed the lives of over 2,000 people many of whom were raped and burnt alive. It led to the US Department of State revoking Mr. Modi\u2019s US visa under the International Religious Freedom Act. The revocation was in place until Mr. Modi became Prime Minister of India.<\/p> <p>The Supreme Court of India has scheduled a bail hearing for Mr. Bhatt on January 22. Under Indian law, courts can grant bail to those convicted of various crimes, including murder, pending their appeal at higher courts. Mr. Bhatt was convicted in June 2019 for the death of a man in 1990. His defense was not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses during the brief trial, nor was it allowed to present its own witnesses or submit evidence. India\u2019s human rights groups have called it a sham trial.<\/p> <p>Dr. Shashi Tharoor, currently a member of Parliament and formerly an Undersecretary General at the United Nations, said he was \u201coutraged by the injustice meted out\u201d to Mr. Bhatt, whose \u201cconscientious service to society\u201d and \u201cindomitable capacity for speaking truth to power\u201d had put him in jail.<\/p> <p>\u201cSanjiv\u2019s case is a reflection of the grim times that we live in, where constitutional values and fundamental privileges that have been granted by the constitution to all Indians appear in many cases to be diluted and in many cases perhaps even supplanted by illiberal forces,\u201d Dr. Tharoor said. \u201cAll Indians with a conscience like Sanjiv Bhatt\u2019s must stand up and fight back against such challenges that threaten to undermine the very foundation of our republic.\u201d<\/p> <p>Filmmaker and human rights defender Anand Patwardhan said Mr. Bhatt had been jailed \u201cfor no other reason than the fact that he opposed the massacre in 2002\u201d and spoke against it. Mr. Patwardhan said the civil society \u201cshould build a movement for Mr. Bhatt\u2019s release.\u201d<\/p> <p>Human rights activist, classical dancer and actor Mallika Sarabhai said there was a \u201cdefinite agenda\u201d not only in the retribution against Mr. Bhatt but in the case of most critics of the Modi government. \u201cIf anyone speaks against the government or asks a question, which is a fundamental right of our democracy, they are somehow punished. Raids are carried out against them, false cases are brought up, fraudulent charges are made, and they are made to silence,\u201d Ms. Sarabhai said.<\/p> <p>\u201cI hope that today we will be able to appeal to the better sense of our great courts to say what is being done to Sanjiv is wrong and needs to be corrected immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cVindictiveness should find no place in our courts or in any of the decisions taken. It is a sign of weakness and it is a sign of fear. And our courts can neither be weak nor fearful. I hope that our appeal will see that Sanjiv gets a fair trial and that this case is dismissed as the frivolous case that it is.\u201d<\/p> <p>She said she was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d as India\u2019s \u201cdependable\u201d institutions such as the Supreme Court had \u201ckeeled over to the powers that be.\u201d The Supreme Court was \u201ctoday taking cases which are liked by the government on an urgent basis; and other cases which are extremely important and involve thousands of people have been left to stew,\u201d she said. Dozens of human rights fighters, educators and writers were in jail without bail, \u201cwithout even the slightest courtesy for their age of any other infirmity.\u201d<\/p> <p>Gandhian activist and Magsaysay Award winner Sandeep Pandey said Mr. Bhatt was the \u201cmost courageous\u201d of all police officers as he filed an affidavit stating that Narendra Modi had \u201cchaired a meeting in which the police officers were told to go soft on the Hindutva brigade which was rampaging against the Muslims.\u201d Mr. Pandey said that \u201cmanipulation of cases\u201d was a \u201ccommon story\u201d in the Modi government.<\/p> <p>Mr. Pandey cited the case of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath, who had \u201c16 cases against him, including a case of murder and inciting riot,\u201d but the cases were withdrawn later. \u201cThey manipulate cases so that either the witnesses are threatened or the people who have filed the cases are threatened to withdraw the cases and the judges are influenced so that the people who have committed the crimes are not convicted.\u201d<\/p> <p>If Mr. Bhatt\u2019s affidavit was \u201ctaken seriously by the court\u201d, proceedings will begin against Mr. Modi \u201cand obviously that cannot happen because he is now Prime Minister. \u201cSanjiv is paying a price for what he did and the people who are in power are in a situation right now to be able to manipulate things, so that they can get away with their crimes. Everyone knows about it.\u201d<\/p> <p>The crimes committed by Mr. Modi, India\u2019s home minister Amit Shah and Mr. Adityanath were \u201cwell known\u201d but because they are in power they can \u201cevade action\u201d against themselves.<\/p> <p>Renowned activist S. R. Darapuri, who is a former Inspector-General of Police in Uttar Pradesh, said he could related to Mr. Bhatt\u2019s predicament as they both were \u201cupright and righteous\u201d police officers who had both been \u201cat the receiving end of State oppression.\u201d<\/p> <p>Mr. Bhatt was \u201cnot involved in any way in the case in which he has been falsely implicated. He has been prosecuted and convicted merely because he dared to expose the involvement of the then Chief Minister of Gujarat in the 2002 pogrom,\u201d Mr. Darapuri said. Mr. Bhatt\u2019s situation is \u201cnot unusual\u201d as it has become the \u201cunavoidable fate of those who dare to question the State.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cA large number of human rights activists and other prominent personalities who have dedicated their lives to the social cause are facing the same consequences,\u201d said Mr. Darapuri, who was arrested in Uttar Pradesh last year for opposing the anti-Muslim Citizenship (Amendment) Act. said. \u201cUnfortunately, our criminal justice system has been subverted to serve the interest of those in power.\u201d The world \u201cmust recognize the impending danger of the onslaught of fascism in India, he added.<\/p> <p>Women\u2019s rights activist Arundhati Dhuru said even thirty years ago in his early career Mr. Bhatt \u201cnever used the power of his baton or firearms but he always always stood by the side of the people to fight\u201d against oppression. \u201cThis is a testing time for the honorable Supreme Court of India to uphold the same constitution by the rule of law, and take out all the charges and release [Mr. Bhatt] unconditionally.\u201d<\/p> <p>Saurin Shah, Ahmedabad-based lawyer who defended Mr. Bhatt at his flawed trial, gave a detailed chronology of the case. In October 1990, Mr. Bhatt was posted at Jamnagar, Gujarat, when local police arrested 133 rioters, one of whom died 18 days after release. Importantly, none of the 133 people, including the person who died later at a private hospital, had made any allegations of police torture or brutality, even when they met a magistrate. The medical record at the jail where the rioters were imprisoned do not mention any injuries to anyone.<\/p> <p>The alleged murder victim, Prabhudas, was twice examined by the jail doctor and at the local government hospital, and none recorded any complaint of torture or injuries.<\/p> <p>Commending Mr. Bhatt as a \u201cbrave officer\u201d who \u201cspoke truth to power,\u201d Raju Rajagopal, co-founder of Hindus for Human Rights, recalled that Mr. Bhatt had witnessed the \u201cfateful decision\u201d by Mr. Modi, who was at that time Gujarat\u2019s chief minister, that the \u201claw enforcement shall stand down to give Hindu nationalist organizations free rein to attack\u201d Muslims. Mr. Bhatt had been \u201cincessantly hounded by the authorities since that time,\u201d Rajagopal said.<\/p> <p>\u201cIn 2018, he was interrogated on a decades-old case, was tried on completely bogus charges without any opportunity for the defense to call their witnesses, and was put him away for life.\u201d<\/p> <p>Rasheed Ahmed, Executive Director of Indian American Muslim Council, said the Indian government must stop \u201cpolitically managing Mr. Sanjiv Bhat\u2019s case and let the law take its course under the supervision of independent judges not the judges who are either scared of government or have themselves becomes political.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is no ambiguity that Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt\u2019s conviction and incarceration are politically motivated and that the charges against him are baseless,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \u201cThe courts clearly know it but the political masters want him silenced so that their own crimes stay in the dark rooms out of the public eye.\u201d<\/p> <p>Mr Ahmed said that Mr. Bhatt deserved a \u201cfair trial and an \u201cindependent judiciary\u201d.<\/p> <p>IAMC and HfHR have pledged to continue the struggle, not only to secure Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt\u2019s release but to end the victimization of human rights defenders, journalists and whistleblowers. Both organizations expressed confidence that ultimately the forces of hate and division would be defeated in their attempt to subvert pluralism and democracy in India.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"30P8I9JKOK0BJWAOIJHMNFBWU4AV53"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":333,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"1990","month":"October","date":null,"city":"Jamnagar","region":"Gujarat","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sanjiv Bhatt","victim_keywords":"police officer, conviction, fraudulent","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1130,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2002","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sanjiv Bhatt","victim_keywords":"police officer","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":662,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021","month":"01","date":"19","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Indian","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sanjiv Bhatt","victim_keywords":"eyewitness, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s complicity in the mass violence against Muslims, Gujarat pogrom of 2002","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2021","city":"Jamnagar","region":"Gujarat","date":"19","country":"India","month":"01","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Sanjiv Bhatt","victim_keywords":"eyewitness, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s complicity in the mass violence against Muslims, Gujarat pogrom of 2002","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":874877868,"Input.title":"At least 26 dead after violent clashes in Indonesia","Input.publish_date":"2019-09-24 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>1\/2<\/p> <p>The Indonesian government tighten security in Papua and West Papua province amid continuing unrest that was triggered by accusations that security forces insulted Papuan students in Surabaya, East Java.

Whenever we see one, all we feel is anger and fear.\u201d Every evening on television, the military announces new arrest warrants for celebrities and others who have been critical of the regime.

Credit:Ysa P\u00e9rez\/The New York Times Before leaving for the United States, she watched anxiously to see if her name had ended up on the military\u2019s wanted list. She saw reports of well-known people being detained as they tried to leave the country, so she decided to wear a hoodie and glasses to keep from being recognised at the Yangon airport. \u201cI had to pass through immigration, and I was so scared,\u201d she said in an interview from Florida. In criticising the junta from outside her country, Miss Universe Myanmar is not alone.<\/p> <p>Win Htet Oo, one of the country\u2019s best swimmers, said from Australia that he was giving up his dream of going to the Olympics and would not compete under the Myanmar flag until the regime\u2019s leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, was removed from power. And mixed martial arts fighter Aung La Nsang, an American citizen and one of Myanmar\u2019s most famous athletes, has urged President Joe Biden to help end the suffering of Myanmar\u2019s people. Loading Thuzar Wint Lwin said she believes that it will not be safe for her to return to Myanmar after speaking out against the regime; she does not know where she will go after the pageant ends. An English major at East Yangon University, her path to the pro-democracy movement can perhaps be traced back to her childhood. She grew up in a middle-class household. Like many parents, her father, a businessman, and her mother, a housewife, dared not discuss the military government that was then in power. One of her early memories was walking with her mother near Sule Pagoda in downtown Yangon in 2007, when monks led nationwide protests against military rule. She was 7. As they neared the pagoda, soldiers broke up the protest by shooting their guns in the air. People started running. She and her mother ran, too.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe were very scared,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWe went to a stranger\u2019s house, and we were hiding.\u201d Soon after, the military crushed that protest movement by shooting dozens of people. But by 2011, the military began sharing power with civilian leaders and opening the country, allowing cellphones and affordable internet access to flood in. Thuzar Wint Lwin is part of the first generation in Myanmar to grow up fully connected to the outside world and for whom a free society seemed normal. In 2015, the country seated democratically elected officials for the first time in more than a half-century. \u201cWe have been living in freedom for five years,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not take us back. We know all about the world. We have the internet.\u201d November was the first time she was old enough to vote, and she cast her ballot for the National League for Democracy, the party of Suu Kyi, which won in a landslide, only to have the military overturn the results by seizing power. Before the coup, Thuzar Wint Lwin\u2019s biggest ordeal came when she was 19 and had surgery to remove precancerous tumours from each breast, leaving permanent scars. She decided against having laser treatment to improve their appearance as a reminder of her success in preventing cancer.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a scar and I\u2019m still me,\u201d she wrote in a recent post with photographs of the scars. \u201cI met self-acceptance realising nothing changed who I am and the values I set for myself. Now, when I see those scars, I feel empowered.\u201d Loading She began modelling when she was in high school and, after her father\u2019s retirement, helped support the family. She is one of fewer than a dozen contestants from Myanmar ever to compete in the Miss Universe pageant, which was founded in 1952. During the period from 1962 to 2011, when the Tatmadaw first ruled, Myanmar sent no contestants. When Thuzar Wint Lwin arrived in Florida on May 7, she was told the suitcase with her outfits for the competition had been lost by the airline. Most contestants had already arrived and were busy rehearsing, making videos and having photo shoots. As the week wore on, the bag still had not arrived, but the pageant organisers were helping her with her gown, and other contestants were lending her outfits. Her national costume was among the missing items. People from Myanmar who live in the United States provided her with a stunning replacement of ethnic Chin origin. She wore it Thursday to the applause of many in the crowd.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"3NI0WFPPIBVR9Z9MK532USZ6W39603"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":750,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2007","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Yangon","region":"None","country":"Myanmar","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Thuzar Wint Lwin","victim_keywords":"contestants, fear, harrass","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"celebrities, critical, warrants, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1185,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2011","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Myanmar","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Thuzar Wint Lwin","victim_keywords":"miss universe myanmar","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":425,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"05","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Myanmar","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Thuzar Wint Lwin","victim_keywords":"Miss Universe Myanmar, Candy","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2021","city":"Yangon","region":null,"date":null,"country":"Myanmar","month":"05","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Thuzar Wint Lwin","victim_keywords":"contestants, fear, harrass","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"celebrities, critical, warrants, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":938611647,"Input.title":"INTERVIEW: Sowore's Trial Has Exposed Hypocrisy Of Nigerian Government, Charges Against Him Baseless And Should Be Dropped\u2014Adegboruwa","Input.publish_date":"2020-08-03 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, in this interview with SaharaReporters, speaks on human rights violations by the Nigerian government as the #RevolutionNow struggle clocks a year.<\/p> <p>What is your opinion of many human rights violations under the government of President Muhammadu Buhari?<\/p> <p>It is sickening. As a matter of fact, I am presently researching the case of Mr Gabriel Emperor Ogbonna, a human rights activist arrested for over 100 days now. He has been in custody despite several orders issued by the court for his release.<\/p> <p>Aside from my personal opinion, I think the general belief is that President Muhammadu Buhari, from his body language, encourages these abuses of the rights of citizens. This is why we have many 'awaiting trial' cases in many correctional centres in the country.<\/p> <p>It is unacceptable. When you check the records of this particular regime, you will notice that indeed, they have not done well in the area of respect for the liberty of Nigerians.<\/p> <p>I think the President should take steps to comply with provisions of the constitution on the liberty of citizens of this country.<\/p> <p>What would you say might have gone wrong since Nigeria has a constitution that spelt out these rights?<\/p> <p>Section 35, chapter 4 of the Nigerian Constitution says that every person shall be entitled to his\/her liberty and no person shall be deprived of such freedom except, and in accordance with, the procedures permitted by law.<\/p> <p>After the right to life, guaranteed under section 33 of the constitution, liberty should be next. Any government that cannot ensure respect for the freedom of citizens doesn't qualify to describe itself as democratic.<\/p> <p>In this regard, the wrong aspect is that the President has elevated national security above human rights and above the liberty of citizens such that policemen hide under guise of 'national security' to violate the rights of citizens.<\/p> <p>We are unable to account for the whereabouts of a number of our citizens. That was why I said the human rights record of this administration is abysmal, considering the disrespect to the judicial system and court orders.<\/p> <p>SR - Omoyele Sowore, the publisher of SaharaReporters, was arrested last year for planning to organise a protest to demand good governance. How would you assess the trial in the light of standard legal practice?<\/p> <p>When you consider the experience of the publisher of SaharaReporters, Mr Omoyele Sowore, a prominent Nigerian, you can imagine what other less prominent Nigerians pass through when their constitutional rights are also being abused.<\/p> <p>The constitution states clearly that every citizen of Nigeria shall be entitled to freedom of expression and freedom to hold an opinion, to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.<\/p> <p>The court case involving Mr Sowore has further exposed the hypocrisy of the government in the area of charging people to court for exercising their rights to freedom of expression. Section 39 of our constitution allows citizens of this country to express their views and opinions without interference.<\/p> <p>I am not surprised that since the charge was filed against him, it has been one dingdong affair. The government has not been able to come up with any tangible proof to sustain that charge. It is clear that they couldn't sustain that charge.<\/p> <p>It is better to save face and withdraw the case rather than keep him in custody, and limit him to a particular town where he won't be allowed to travel to see his family members. Sowore's case is indeed a clear example of how the rights of citizens have been trampled upon by this regime over the years.<\/p> <p>Since the matter is still in court, we cannot comment further. Again, I hope the President would direct relevant security agencies, especially the Ministry of Justice, to do the needful in Sowore's case because he committed no crime.<\/p> <p>How do you think Sowore's arrest has affected agitations generally in Nigeria? Do you think it has made people more scared to demand their rights?<\/p> <p>I don't think so. It depends on knowing your right and being brave about it. My appeal is that the people should not give up; they should continue to stand up, to demand their rights, irrespective of political or religious affiliations.<\/p> <p>The abuse of human rights knows no race or religion. We should not sit down and do nothing -- when a particular regime turns our nation into a banana republic where citizens disappear at will.<\/p> <p>We can't continue to have a country whereby a leader doesn't want to hear another view. We cannot also have a democracy where there is no opposition. We cannot run a system, which we claim is democratic, and rallies cannot be held peacefully.<\/p> <p>People, who support the government, are given police protection. They hold rallies all over the country without any form of arrest, brutality, intimidation or molestation in the hands of security agencies.<\/p> <p>The government should be fair and apply equal standards to citizens, irrespective of their political or religious opinion. No one should get scared to exercise their franchise and fundamental human rights.<\/p> <p>Sowore has demanded a revolution for good governance. What do you make of the government's claim that this is treason?<\/p> <p>If a citizen demands revolution or demands a change and he bears no arm, if all he does is to organise a peaceful street protest to galvanise the citizens; I don't think that should qualify for treasonable felony.<\/p> <p>Sadly, it is the government that doesn't recognise its role. Omoyele Sowore was only following the intent of the drafters of our constitution in demanding better welfare, infrastructural development and policies that would better the life of the masses of our country.<\/p> <p>If you go to chapter 2 of our constitution, which we call the fundamental objective, it stated clearly that the economic capacity of Nigeria should not be concentrated in the hands of a few.<\/p> <p>The government is supposed to subsidise services that affect the masses like electricity, education, health, among other things because they have collected the taxes from the people, and they are holding our purse.<\/p> <p>They are supposed to use those funds to build roads, electricity, good schools and hospitals such that those who are unable to have access to loot our treasury can still be able to feel the impact of the state in their lives.<\/p> <p>I would use myself as an example. I don't think I could have afforded secondary and primary education, but for the free education policy of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Through his free education policy, I was able to go to school.<\/p> <p>We can't have a state whereby private universities are more than government-owned schools, a state where private jets outnumber public flights that we should have.<\/p> <p>The current experience we have is that the rich people are getting richer while the margin between the poor and the rich is widening every day. The middle class has been wiped off; it is either you are so rich, or you are so weak. That is not the intention of the founders of our nation.<\/p> <p>In that regard, I think that Mr Sowore has found support in the generality of the people of Nigeria because he is the one doing what the founders of our nation expect our leaders to do.<\/p> <p>There is a general opinion that the judiciary is also culpable in the abuse of human rights through slow trials and corruption that mar the system. Do you agree?<\/p> <p>The case of our judiciary deserves some sympathy. We need to interrogate the judges to know their plights. I have undertaken a study and discovered that the executive is deliberately at war with the judiciary. They are frustrating the judicial institutions with lack of fund and undue interference in the discharge of their responsibilities.<\/p> <p>Take the judiciary at the state level, for instance. Virtually the judiciary in the states is under the executive. Many judges have embraced self-timidity; they are scared to declare the law the way it is for fear of intimidation and persecution.<\/p> <p>Corruption in the judiciary institution is an unfortunate development. I see many judges as upright. I have had the opportunity to appear before many of them. If given the free will to perform their duties, they are capable of dispensing justice, especially to all kinds of citizens.<\/p> <p>Upon his election in 2015, President Buhari declared clearly that the judiciary was his headache. The constitution requires a judge to dispense justice without fear or favour. The law enforcement agencies have been doing a lot in investigating and shaming judiciary officers who have compromised their positions.<\/p> <p>The majority of our judges have displayed exceptional courage, despite the odds. Look at the case of Mr Sowore. Initially, the DSS acted as if they were above the law. On the day that the judge stood her ground, and gave an ultimatum of 24 hours to the DSS to obey court order, you saw that everywhere was shaking.<\/p> <p>They have the power, the force and people behind them, but they need to exhibit that courage to declare the law, as it is, notwithstanding what the leaders think.<\/p> <p>The record of the democratic experience of Nigeria is that the judiciary has been the stabilising factor in attaining our democracy. They should not shy away from that responsibility of being the last hope of the common man. They should also speak truth to power whenever there are cases of abuse on the right of citizens.<\/p> <p>What is your assessment of our security agencies as people have alleged they are being used as machinery to abuse the rights of citizens?<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, our security personnel have become tools in the hands of authorities or those in power to infringe on the rights and also privileges of citizens. They use them against us, and when they finish the job, they are dumped.<\/p> <p>Again, just imagine the case of Mr Sowore and how he was arrested and maltreated by the DSS operatives. These are the same set of people you are fighting, on their behalf, for a better country where everyone can remain equal.<\/p> <p>It is sad that these set of guys, who are our brothers, are the ones being used by the authorities to trample on our rights. They feel it is the right thing they are doing. Many of them forget that we would still meet on the streets, go to the same mall or market to get something for our family.<\/p> <p>So, we can't continue to have a system where the security agencies would continue abusing the rights of citizens.<\/p> <p>Insecurity in the country is growing worse, mostly in the north with many senseless killings, what should we do as a nation?<\/p> <p>I don't think there is any way we can speak louder, in terms of indictment and declaration of incompetence on our security agencies, than the National Assembly has done. The lawmakers have demanded the sack of the service chiefs.<\/p> <p>The attitude of our security personnel can be summarised in the proceedings of the Senate about a week ago, whereby a resolution was unanimously passed, calling for the sack of the service chiefs.<\/p> <p>For instance, you would have noticed that over 300 officers of the Nigeria Army voluntarily applied to be discharged from the service recently. The reason given was that there was no moral, welfare and lack of equipment.<\/p> <p>That is the condition of our security agencies generally. That is why there is an upsurge in crime, including the abuses of the rights of citizens.<\/p> <p>We now have a security apparatus, whose leader is building a university in his town. In this country, people have left the core mandates of protecting the territorial integrity of our country and ventured into the business of education.<\/p> <p>We have no security presently. That is why the Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, made it clear that there is a conspiracy going on in the northeast because those who attacked his convoy were not Boko Haram insurgents. They didn't want him to see the secret of what is going on in Baga.<\/p> <p>The Boko Haram war has become a business. It may not end, given the amount of money budgeted in prosecuting the war and because it was one of the reasons President Goodluck Jonathan was voted out of office.<\/p> <p>In President Buhari's hometown in Katsina, bandits have taken over. We all thought that in the first year of his government, activities of Boko Haram would have been a thing of the past. It is unfortunate to say this government has lost it, and he (Buhari) has not performed up to the expectation of Nigerians in terms of protecting lives and property.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"306W7JMRY0DFX0VKB0XPYNRGT2W8BD"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":649,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Omoyele Sowore","victim_keywords":"publisher, SaharaReporters","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":469,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Gabriel Emperor Ogbonna","victim_keywords":"activist, arrested","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Omoyele Sowore","victim_keywords":"publisher, arrested, maltreated","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"24528428-dbe4-46d7-bd43-27324cef42f6","work_time_in_seconds":370,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2020","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Gabriel Emperor Ogbonna","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2019","city":null,"region":null,"date":null,"country":"Nigeria","month":null,"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Gabriel Emperor Ogbonna","victim_keywords":"activist, arrested","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Omoyele Sowore","victim_keywords":"publisher, arrested, maltreated","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1004557851,"Input.title":"Two men charged with murder of journalist Lyra McKee, Northern Irish police say","Input.publish_date":"2021-09-17 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Two men have been charged with the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, Northern Irish Police announced.<\/p> <p>\"The pair, aged 21 and 33, have also been charged with possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life, riot, possession of petrol bombs, throwing petrol bombs, and arson,\" police said on Twitter.<\/p> <p>The 33-year-old has also been charged with robbery, they added.<\/p> <p>A third man, 20, has been charged with riot, possession of petrol bombs, and throwing petrol bombs.<\/p> <p>A fourth man, 19, has meanwhile been released pending investigation, police added.

The provider did not report the incident to the NDIS watchdog.<\/p> <p>In another incident, the commission heard a Life Without Barriers investigation found there was not enough evidence to substantiate claims a support worker pushed a client at the NSW home to the ground, even though the employee admitted doing so.<\/p> <p>Fronting the royal commission on Tuesday, Claire Robbs, the

areas where harm has been caused to people and we acknowledge and offer our deepest regret,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Robbs also apologised to each of the victims individually, using the pseudonyms used by the royal commission.<\/p> <p>\u201cI do not condone the violence towards Sophie, and I offer Sophie and her family our sincere apology for the harm caused to her, including for the manner in which our investigations into the matter was undertaken,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>She also apologised to a woman known by the pseudonym Natalie for alleged \u201csexual misconduct by a staff member\u201d,

course in such a case would be to offer compensation.<\/p> <p>Life Without Barriers has not offered Natalie or her family compensation.<\/p> <p>It was also Natalie who was later hospitalised and, according to evidence from her mother, nearly died, after a bowel obstruction that followed the failure of staff to adhere to care protocols.<\/p> <p>Under questioning from counsel assisting Patrick Griffin, Robbs conceded the provider only paid $1 a month to lease the Victoria group home, but still charged residents a proportion of their fortnightly pension on \u201crent\u201d.<\/p> <p>Robbs suggested the \u201crent\u201d also covered maintenance and other services, though she could not say if this was pointed out to the residents or families.<\/p> <p>Griffin put to Robbs that most people would consider \u201crent\u201d to refer to money paid to a landlord for the right to live in a property.<\/p> <p>\u201cI think if someone asked me that question I would think that the rent also covered the maintenance that would be required to be done to the premises, that would be something I would expect that would be part of the rental payment,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>The inquiry has previously heard Sophie, who lives with cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability, was sexually assaulted by a date in a public park.<\/p> <p>Sophie last week told the royal commission they met in a park because Life Without Barriers banned her from having guests in the house after 6pm.<\/p> <p>Hobbs was asked why such a serious incident was not reported to the Life Without Barriers board.<\/p>

those rules in effect made [Life Without Barriers] in part responsible for what subsequently happened\u201d.<\/p> <p>That was \u201cbecause Sophie was denied the opportunity to have someone in her home, and consequently was put in a more vulnerable position\u201d.<\/p> <p>Under questioning, Robbs agreed that was the case, but maintained it was proper not to report the incident to the

Lukashenko","Input.publish_date":"2021-08-29 14:30:22","Input.article_interface":"<p>BISMARCK, North Dakota \u2014 As part of the former Soviet Union, it is not surprising that Belarus still has deep ties to Russia. The current president, Alexander Lukashenko leads the country with a brutal regime that appears to some citizens to cater mostly to the needs of Russia and not the citizens of Belarus. This has led many in the country to push for Lukashenko\u2019s removal and the implementation of a truly democratic system.<\/p> <p>The Necessity of Democracy in Belarus<\/p> <p>There are several reasons for the push for democracy. One of the main reasons is the brutal human rights abuses that those within Belarus are subjected to, especially when they dissent from the government. Recently, the government has cracked down violently on protestors and journalists who it views as a threat. These human rights abuses have led to international outcry.<\/p> <p>While the human rights issues are at center stage, there is another reason for citizens to push for democracy in Belarus. The economy is closely tied to that of Russia, which means that growth is almost stagnant. The Soviet-era economy that still operates in Belarus may have led to shockingly low poverty numbers, but this does not tell the whole story. Belarus still operates under a Soviet-era economy with state-owned industrial and agricultural sectors. This means that even though poverty rates are low, the country is far from wealthy, especially in rural areas. Democratization would allow for more growth and more earned wealth as the economy modernized.<\/p> <p>The U.S. government has not ignored the situation in Belarus. U.S. action in Belarus has come from the Biden administration, Congress and the embassy in Belarus. While the administration has issued harsh statements on the situation, it is also weighing possible sanctions. Congress has held Senate hearings to learn more about the situation and determine what U.S. action in Belarus is most needed.<\/p> <p>President Biden\u2019s Response<\/p> <p>In May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 diverted its course while over Belarussian airspace when air traffic control reported they had a bomb on board. The plane was escorted by a Belarussian MiG fighter jet. Once it landed, Belarussian authorities boarded the plane and arrested Raman Pratasevich, a dissident journalist and his girlfriend. The plane was then allowed to continue its journey. The bomb threat appeared to be fake to get the aircraft to land.<\/p> <p>This incident sparked outcry across the world. President Biden released a statement on the incident as well as the overall situation in Belarus. In this statement, President Biden condemned the actions taken by the Belarussian government. He also called for the release of Pratasevich as well as hundreds of other political prisoners. Additionally, he called for an international investigation into the situation in Belarus. President Biden offered his support of the call for economic sanctions against Belarus. He also vowed that U.S. action in Belarus would support the citizens seeking democracy.<\/p> <p>Since the president\u2019s statement, it has also been reported that the administration is planning on imposing additional sanctions against Belarus. This action is likely to come in the form of an executive order. This new order would update the current in-use order from 2006 also could include human-rights sanctions against Lukashenko\u2019s regime.<\/p> <p>The State Department has also issued a do not travel order for U.S. citizens, warning that Belarus may be unsafe. Ned Price, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department indicated during a June 3 briefing that the Belarussian government placed limitations on allowing American diplomats in the country. Price indicated that despite this, U.S. action in Belarus would continue to support the citizens seeking democracy and the U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher would still be working to support them from outside Belarus.<\/p> <p>Senate Hearing<\/p> <p>On June 9, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on U.S. action in Belarus. In this hearing, they heard from U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the Democratic Opposition in Belarus and Jamie Fly, President and CEO of Radio Free Europe.<\/p> <p>U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher gave testimony that starkly contradicted the portrait painted by President Lukashenko. She claimed that the Belarussian government has given up so much of its sovereignty to Vladimir Putin and Russia that it no longer has any control over Russia\u2019s actions within Belarus.<\/p> <p>In her testimony, Fisher also outlined some U.S. action in Belarus taken against Lukashenko\u2019s government. She stated that the government placed visa restrictions on those responsible for undermining Belarussian democracy. She also indicated that the U.S. sent more than $20 million in aid since August 2020 to help those in Belarus. There is another $500,000 allocated to the International Accountability Platform for Belarus pending congressional approval.<\/p> <p>In her testimony, Tsikhanouskaya, who has been living in exile in Lithuania since Lukashenko\u2019s election in August 2020, called Lukashenko a \u201cthreat to international peace and security.\u201d She urged the U.S. to impose strict sanctions against the oil sectors as well as on foreign funders of Belarus. According to her, these sanctions would make the biggest difference inside the country.<\/p> <p>International Solidarity<\/p> <p>As Lukashenko\u2019s government continues to brutally crackdown on dissidents seeking democracy in the country, there is hope. The international community has come out against the government\u2019s actions and vowed to help support pro-democracy activists. U.S. action in Belarus also promises to bring about a more democratic system. It will allow the citizens of Belarus to have a more democratic and more free economic system.<\/p> <p>\u2013 Taryn Steckler-Houle<\/p> <p>Photo: Flickr<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"3S8A4GJRD5I720A2N2RRFLPWQZLV6J"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"7b8989dd-46ba-4242-a051-7457344fba3d","work_time_in_seconds":340,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["enforced disappearance"],"year":"2021","month":"May","date":null,"city":"N\/a","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Raman Pratasevich","victim_keywords":"dissident, Belarus, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"girlfriend","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":1145,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021","month":"05","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"protestors, journalists","victim_type":["human rights defender","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Raman Pratasevich","victim_keywords":"dissident journalist, fake bomb threat","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":621,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2021","month":"05","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Belarus","country":"Europe","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"belarus citizens, girlfriend of Pratasevich, dissidents seeking democracy","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Raman Pratasevich","victim_keywords":"dissident","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2021","city":"N\/a","region":"Belarus","date":null,"country":"Belarus","month":"05","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Raman Pratasevich","victim_keywords":"dissident, Belarus, journalist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"girlfriend","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":996363759,"Input.title":"White House blames Facebook and YouTube for spreading vaccine misinformation","Input.publish_date":"2021-07-23 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Facebook logo is reflected in a drop on a syringe needle in this illustration photo taken March 16, 2021.

Zimbabwe is undergoing a 21-day nationwide lockdown decreed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in a bid to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.(Photo: EPA-EFE \/ Aaron Ufumeli)<\/p> <p>To people from other countries, this might sound like a perfectly acceptable message from a president during a time of crisis. However, this is Zimbabwe \u2013 a country where the president believes people are using social media to plot to remove him from power. A country where anyone who questions the government is accused of causing \u2018alarm and despondency\u2019.<\/p> <p>This was nothing short of a declaration of war on free speech during the lockdown.<\/p> <p>The government then announced the Public Health (Covid-19 Prevention, Containment and Treatment) Regulations 2020. One of the sections deals with \u201cfalse reporting during the national lockdown\u201d. It says:<\/p> <p>\u201c14. For the avoidance of doubt any person who publishes or communicates false news about any public officer, official, or enforcement officer involved with enforcing or implementing the national lockdown in his or her capacity as such, or about any private individual that has the effect of prejudicing the State\u2019s enforcement of the national lockdown, shall be liable for prosecution under section 31 of the Criminal law Code (\u201cPublishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to the state\u201d) and liable to the penalty there provided, that is to say, a fine up to or exceeding twenty years or both.\u201d<\/p> <p>In the wrong hands, this law will be used to terrorise journalists and silence dissenting voices during the lockdown. In a country where law enforcement officers conflate the state and the party, how many people will be arrested for criticising the ruling party?<\/p> <p>In a country where everything on social media that exposes the government\u2019s misdeeds or tries to hold the government to account is considered false reporting, how can Zimbabweans be sure they are safe when they expose those crimes?<\/p> <p>There have already been several reports of abuse of journalists by the police.<\/p> <p>On 4 April, the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA Zimbabwe) posted a tweet saying freelance journalist Panashe Makufa was beaten up by the police in the Harare suburb of Kuwadzana while undertaking his professional duties. Makufa told MISA that he had been taking pictures of a police operation. He was arrested, assaulted and forced to delete the pictures.<\/p> <p>On 3 March, Mutare police arrested another journalist, Tatenda Julius, who was released after spending a night in prison and fined $500 for \u2018criminal nuisance\u201d.<\/p> <p>In Chinhoyi, a journalist from the Newsday newspaper, Nunurai Jena, was arrested as he was taking pictures of police operations at a checkpoint and charged with disorderly conduct in a public place. Another journalist, Kudzanai Musengi, was arrested for using a 2019 accreditation card but was released after police were given a directive to let him go.<\/p> <p>On 29 March, Mangwana posted a picture he said was of a ventilator produced by the Harare Institute of Technology, which he said he had seen for himself. He said the institution had the potential to make 40 ventilators a day. Many Zimbabweans were excited to hear the news but became sceptical after Mangwana refused to answer more questions about the ventilators. He received a tweet from Siphosami Malunga, director of OSISA:<\/p> <p>\u201cBut seriously Nick, we expect you to be saying for example that the country needs 1,000 ventilators, 1,000 isolation beds, 10,0000 PPE so we can mobilise our networks to provide this. It\u2019s too late to look good here. We need to focus on saving lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>With characteristic arrogance, the he responded, \u201cThat information will be given. For now I gave this one.\u201d<\/p> <p>And that was the last we heard of the ventilators.<\/p> <p>On 30 March, Minister of Finance Mthuli Ncube announced that \u201ctreasury has set aside resources to cover one million vulnerable households under a Cash Transfer program and payment will commence immediately\u201d. He also said $200-million a month will be set aside for the program over the next three months.<\/p> <p>This left Zimbabweans wondering how the government had come up with the figure of one million households. Had the households been identified already? If so, who were they? What criteria was used? Above all, what were the households to do with $200 (R100) a month? Two kilograms of rice costs $95, 2l of cooking oil is $100. A typical Zimbabwean household has an average of six people. How could they survive on $200 per month?<\/p> <p>Nobody was available to answer questions and one week later \u2013 seven days into the lockdown \u2013 there is no information about the facility.<\/p> <p>On Tuesday 31 March, the second day of the lockdown, the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe decided to hand down a judgement that had been pending for some time in a matter regarding the leadership of the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T).<\/p> <p>Judiciary rushes to judgement<\/p> <p>The delivery of this judgment by the highest court in the country, one day into the lockdown, was shocking to many as the Chief Justice had announced two days earlier that the courts would be closed except for urgent matters.<\/p> <p>This decision was in no way urgent given that it was a case that had been pending for at least three years, with the appeal having been lodged almost a year before.<\/p> <p>As expected by many, the court ruled that Nelson Chamisa is not the leader of the MDC-T and should step down immediately. Before the court proceedings, the police had already barricaded roads leading to Morgan Tsvangirai House, the MDC-T headquarters. This indicated that they knew beforehand what the judgement would be, showing once again how the judiciary and police are used to fight ZANU-PF battles.<\/p> <p>The same courts which ruled that the November 2017 coup was constitutional are the ones that ruled last Tuesday that Chamisa\u2019s rise to power in his political party was unconstitutional. The double standards and hypocrisy are breathtaking.<\/p> <p>But what is truly appalling is the fact that our ZANU-PF government had no qualms in relying on the courts to take advantage of a pandemic that is devastating the world \u2013 by using the lockdown to settle political scores. They knew that, because of the lockdown, supporters of Nelson Chamisa and the MDC would be unable to publicly protest the ruling.<\/p> <p>How are Zimbabweans meant to take the lockdown seriously when those who imposed it abuse it in this manner?<\/p> <p>There have been reports of police brutality, with videos of citizens found outside their homes being severely beaten, arrested and piled up in trucks in Bulawayo after being accused of breaking lockdown laws.<\/p> <p>Despite the announcement by the president that farmers and food providers are essential services and would not be disrupted, there have been countless documented cases of police confiscating food from traders and destroying it.<\/p> <p>This is a country in which millions face starvation. A country in which the majority is either unemployed or underemployed. How do we begin to justify such heartless destruction of food and livelihoods?<\/p> <p>Many Zimbabweans have no transport and have to walk to access any essential services. Police, therefore, are not meant to arrest people indiscriminately. When I went to the pharmacy, I found queues for mealie-meal all over town. People were not maintaining physical distancing and expressed desperation at the food shortages. Right now, mealie-meal shortages are the biggest threat to the effectiveness of the lockdown.<\/p> <p>But even this has provided an opportunity for corruption. Police, who control the queues, are accused of buying mealie-meal and reselling it at a profit on the black market. In response to the public outcry, President Mnangagwa was forced to issue a statement to instruct the police to stop preventing traders from selling and citizens from buying food. However, it does not seem to be consistently complied with.<\/p> <p>Thanks to an insensitive government, it never rains in Zimbabwe. It only pours.<\/p> <p>On 4 April, Zimbabweans woke up to an announcement that the government had increased the price of fuel by $3 \u2013 or 16%. The reason for the increase has not been explained.<\/p> <p>It is inexplicable that the government would consider it wise to increase the price of fuel right in the middle of a lockdown in which economic conditions are already severely constrained.<\/p> <p>Most Zimbabweans are all too aware that fuel is a strategic target for corruption by ZANU-PF and Sakunda Fuels which is run by Kuda Tagwirei, a close ally of both Mnangagwa and his deputy Constantino Chiwenga. Sakunda has a monopoly on importing fuel and retails it via fuel stations in which senior ZANU-PF officials reportedly have an interest.<\/p> <p>From all the above it is quite evident that the lockdown has little or nothing to do with trying to curb the spread of Covid-19 and everything to do with the state reminding people of its \u201cmight\u201d, while also seizing the opportunity to advance its corrupt interests. They embark on these displays of power every once in a while where police and the army use unnecessary and unjustifiable levels of force, simply because they feel people need to be reminded of who is in charge.<\/p> <p>On Monday 6 April, the Chronicle newspaper reported that the army has been roped in to boost police in enforcing the lockdown. Judging from past experiences, this is unlikely to end well.<\/p> <p>With regard to Covid-19\u2019s presence in Zimbabwe, by 7 April only 349 people had been tested \u2013 11 of them positive. People have accused the government of under-testing so as to keep the infection rate low.<\/p> <p>The only testing centre is in the capital, Harare. And the only isolation hospital ready for handling Covid-19 is also in Harare. Reports indicate that there are nowhere near enough beds if the virus takes hold in the city.<\/p> <p>In a country with 10 provinces, it is unacceptable to have everything located in just one. It is dangerous and negligent.<\/p> <p>On the brighter side \u2026<\/p> <p>On a more upbeat note, there are efforts and initiatives by business, civil society and religious groups to respond to the threat of the virus. Also encouraging is the fact that despite their mistrust and frustration, most Zimbabweans are adhering to the lockdown. Zimbabwe has a high literacy rate and most people understand how dangerous Covid-19 is and the extent to which it could devastate us if we do not do our part.<\/p> <p>If mealie-meal is made readily available in the shops; if vendors are taught how to observe physical distancing while trading; and if water availability improves especially in the high-density suburbs, Zimbabwe might well be able to prevent the spread of the virus.<\/p> <p>Because of the monopoly, the government holds on information concerning Covid-19 in Zimbabwe, nobody really knows for sure exactly how big a problem it is in the country. Going by government statistics that show no spread of the disease since the ninth case on 2 April, one might be forgiven for hoping that we have, to some extent, been spared. My hope is that the government is giving us a true reflection of the situation and that we have nothing to worry about.<\/p> <p>If I\u2019m wrong, nothing short of a miracle can help Zimbabwe.

Today, cybercrime and drug peddling is now an automatic indictment of both the average Nigerian and Nigeria\u2019s character, just as our comatose international image lies critically at the selective mercy of western propaganda.<\/p> <p>Nigeria, a country where a retired 'DIG' Sen. Nuhu Aliyu of the blessed memory, a one time Senator from Niger State once stood in the Senate Chambers and said, \"There are armed robbers in this chamber.\" He pointedly said that there are many senators that have no business sitting in the hallow chamber.<\/p> <p>A country where a man who was dismissed from the police service for gross misconduct, later emerged from the underworld as kingpin to become a governor of State. A country where a man standing trial for the gruesome assassination of the same country's Minister of Justice and Attorney General, won a seat in the senate from prison. I can go on and on.<\/p> <p>This could be attributed to the collapse of values in the Nigerian society, and generally, to the effect of poverty and how that pushes the people to desperate ends. Materialism and consumerism must be checked.<\/p> <p>Richard Odusanya<\/p> <p>A one-time Nigerian social media 'celebrity', Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, was arrested in Dubai in June 2020 on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.<\/p> <p>Husspuppi's international \"Crime\" was later linked to many people by the American FBI, including Abba Kyari. To date, we haven't heard anything on DCP Abba Kyari who was indicted by the FBI on some allegations of money laundering, bribery and wire fraud, vis-a-vis receiving funds from Hushpuppi.<\/p> <p>How a high ranking Police Officer, an award winning 'Super Cop' and Intelligence Officer for that matter, could be associated with a criminal like Hushpuppi and openly fraternising with characters like Cubana for whatever reason, even if it is for tailoring services or social engagement as DCP Kyari claimed still leaves me bewildered.<\/p> <p>Abba Kyari's allegation is similar to that of Obi Iyiegbu, popularly called Obi Cubana, his \"Man Friday\" who the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) interrogated last week over the payment of three different tranches of money by drug pushers convicted in New Delhi, India; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Lagos, Nigeria, into his various bank accounts.<\/p> <p>Before July 2021, the 46-year-old nightlife entrepreneur remained blurred from the radar of the public until the carnival-like funeral of his mother on July 16, 2021.<\/p> <p>The moment Obi Cubana over-exposed himself, it's no brainer even for a layman to know it was only a matter of time before the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) starts digging into his finances. As a matter of fact, he was detained on November 1, 2021 over allegations of money laundering and tax fraud.<\/p> <p>After watching American series like 'Power' and 'Ozark', one would realize that most 'successful' club businesses are actually fronts for laundering 'dirty' money from ill-gotten wealth. So yeah, it could be that Obi Cubana is just a front. I am not saying he is guilty of anything, but if he is, he won't be the first; the likes of Quilox are sitting on that table as well.<\/p> <p>Suffice to say that no iota of success or failure of the Nigerian is without the asterisk of potential criminality, rooted in a culture where many young people see fraud as the only way to make money. On deeper reflection, it epitomises the present spirit of Nigeria\u2019s younger generation.<\/p> <p>The crazy way millions of Nigerian youths idolise get-rich-quick celebrities has fuelled crimes such as Yahoo-Yahoo, ritualism, kidnapping, drug peddling, armed robbery etc.<\/p> <p>The get-rich-quick syndrome has become a deified, noticeable trend mostly exhibited, to varying degrees, across social media platforms. Exotic cars are flaunted, designer wears rocked, glittering accessories are customary looks across verified pages and profiles, as if to separate those that have \u201cmade it\u201d from those trying to stay as legitimate and clean as the strength of their manhood and the integrity of their professional crafts entail.<\/p> <p>Fundamentally, it is time for us to interrogate our value system. It is time for us to look at some issues deeply, including materialism and consumerism; and change to productive nation.

She has to be.<\/p> <p>She and a small team of psychiatric bed searchers are responsible for calling hospitals across Massachusetts any time a patient is in need of an inpatient psychiatric bed. At any given moment, 20 to 60 mental health patients are temporarily being cared for in one of the five hospital emergency departments covered by Behavioral Health Network, the Western Massachusetts-based emergency service provider where Hollister works. In complex cases, these searches have taken up to six weeks.<\/p> <p>But unlike most health systems across the country, her team has a special tool to speed up that search: a dedicated, state-funded system to back them up. Massachusetts is home to a novel effort known as the Expedited Psychiatric Inpatient Admissions, or EPIA. Created in 2018 by the state\u2019s mental health department, it is designed to cut the red tape to get psychiatric patients placed in appropriate care far faster.<\/p> <p>advertisement<\/p> <p>Patients and family advocates, health providers, insurers, and hospital leaders tell STAT the program \u2014 coupled with new state incentives to bolster mental health care and bed availability \u2014 is already making a difference.

Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have a partner in the state who is holding this part of the system accountable to doing its job. It feels like everyone is rowing in the same direction,\u201d said Lisa Lambert, a children\u2019s mental health advocate with the nonprofit Parent\/Professional Advocacy League.<\/p> <p>advertisement<\/p> <p>Among other changes, EPIA requires hospitals to expedite placement for patients after they\u2019ve boarded in an ER for 60 hours \u2014 but it also provides critical logistical support to help make that possible. Once the clock starts ticking, BHN and the state\u2019s other regional emergency service providers can immediately call on the state\u2019s mental health department, insurance companies, and hospital administrators to escalate the admissions process and clear any barriers standing in the way of placing a patient.<\/p> <p>In some difficult cases, top officials at the state\u2019s mental health department will personally make calls to expedite the process.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a supreme form of advocacy,\u201d said Hollister. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot different when a hospital administrator gets a call from a [state] official asking if the \u2018no\u2019 one of my BHN bed searchers just received from hospital admissions was a \u2018soft no\u2019 or a \u2018hard no.\u2019\u201d<\/p> <p>Research has shown that patients experiencing mental health emergencies that require hospitalization wait nearly four times longer for an inpatient bed than people with other acute issues, and more than five times as long for transfer to another facility. In large part, that\u2019s due to a shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds or staff to care for those patients. While health workers like Hollister hunt for a bed, patients are left to wait, often in the emergency room or, occasionally, another wing of the hospital.<\/p> <p>The problem is especially dire for the growing number of young people with mental health conditions. In Massachusetts, only 340 of the state\u2019s 2,717 psychiatric beds are now available to patients under 18. There are none available for those younger patients in Western Massachusetts, where Hollister\u2019s team is based.<\/p> <p>\u201cBefore the protocol went in place, families called hospitals directly and found that the admissions person had never heard of their child. Some places didn\u2019t keep lists, sometimes mobile crisis teams described kids but didn\u2019t give names, etc.,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cThe new protocol has pushed each hospital to have a common process so those things are less likely to happen.\u201d<\/p> <p>For some parents, like Northampton\u2019s Jamie Guerin, the program\u2019s work, while not a panacea, is a hopeful step. A year ago, her teenage daughter was rushed to a local hospital after a suicide attempt. Guerin said the hospital tried sending her home while she was still physically ill.<\/p> <p>\u201cThen she was locked in the ED,\u201d Guerin said, adding that during the time her daughter had to board in the ER, an adult patient experiencing a psychotic episode barged into her daughter\u2019s room. Her daughter had to board in the ER for four days before EPIA\u2019s requirements kicked in, and she was able to be moved to an appropriate facility.<\/p> <p>In May, as the pandemic took hold, the state mental health department temporarily changed its policy, allowing hospitals to use EPIA for help placing patients after boarding for 24 hours. That has helped patients like Guerin\u2019s daughter \u2014 who was hospitalized again in June 2020 \u2014 get transferred out of the ER far faster.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf the state had not intervened I don\u2019t know how long she might have boarded in that ED,\u201c said Guerin.<\/p> <p>For health systems, one of EPIA\u2019s biggest benefits is that it helps to strategically prioritize the order that patients need to be placed in inpatient beds, which are often in short supply.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat makes EPIA invaluable to our decentralized mental health system is that the state [mental health department] can now set a priority with a hospital for a member who is difficult to place in an inpatient bed,\u201d said Greg Harris, associate medical director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. \u201cWhen a bed opens up, they are first in line. This is the way the system should work.\u201d<\/p> <p>Experts said that other state efforts will be crucial to expanding access to inpatient mental health care alongside EPIA. That includes a move last October to incentivize hospital acceptance of more patients from the state\u2019s public MassHealth program. For at least a year, each designated hospital receives up to a daily $330 bonus for each psychiatric patient exceeding the number cared for the previous year.<\/p> <p>The state also recently approved $10 million in funding for the creation of new inpatient mental health acute care beds, with priority given to beds for children and adolescents in underserved areas of the state. Payments could be up to $150,000 per new bed.<\/p> <p>In the region of western Massachusetts where Hollister works, two hospitals are already considering plans to open new psychiatric units.<\/p> <p>Even with state intervention now beginning after 60 patient hours in the ER, Behavioral Health Network is also looking to fill the treatment gap with an enhanced short-term community crisis stabilization program. It serves patients waiting for psychiatric hospitalization \u2014 and in theory, helps reserve inpatient psychiatric beds for the highest-priority patients.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a higher level of residential treatment care than previously existed in the community,\u201d said CEO Steve Winn. \u201cWe created it for people whose needs are a little bit below inpatient care.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":1,"HIT_id":"3DZKABX2ZKKWIHJ3XT4U1LH6MLXCVT"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"da86f058-00ca-4ec2-b63e-b87f42dab844","work_time_in_seconds":497,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with unknown permissions","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020","month":"January","date":null,"city":"North Hampton","region":"New Hampshire","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"daughter, suicide attempt, locked in","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"child"}]}},{"worker_id":"fd5ebe40-5dbb-4a22-b959-6cf3d0ae0829","work_time_in_seconds":897,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020","month":"05","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"healthcare, mental health, patients","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"worker_id":"7b387f77-1f0b-48dd-b77d-ff8b7e2af7ef","work_time_in_seconds":3498,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"01","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"people, patients, mental health conditions, child,","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"year":"2020","city":"North Hampton","region":"Massachusetts","date":null,"country":"United States","month":"01","perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"people, patients, mental health conditions, child,","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":888964458,"Input.title":"How Opposition parties in Maharashtra put on the \u2018We are 162\u2019 show","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-26 00:54:09+05:30","Input.article_interface":"<p>A day before the Supreme Court is expected to give its verdict on the political turmoil over government formation in Maharashtra, the three-party coalition, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, put up a grand show, \u2018We are 162\u2019, bringing 162 MLAs together on Monday evening.<\/p> <p>The legislators of all three parties were brought in buses to Hotel Grand Hyatt, where 34 NCP legislators have been staying since Sunday evening. While Shiv Sena legislators (56) came from Hotel Lemon Tree in Saki Naka, another 12 NCP MLAs, who are staying at Hotel Sofitel, BKC, were brought in separate buses. The legislators were paraded before the media and also made to take an oath of the Constitution of India to be loyal to their alliance and not fall prey to any inducement by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). They also pledged not to indulge in any anti-party activity and adhere to the instructions given by the leadership of the respective parties.<\/p> <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Maharashtra Congress in-charge Mallikarjun Kharge, along with other top state leaders from all three parties, were present at the event.<\/p> <p>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?<\/p> <p>NCP insiders said it was the idea of leader Jitendra Awhad, also the core committee member, who had earlier organised a Constitution Day walk in Mumbai, in which Sharad Pawar and several other leaders had participated. \u201cSince Tuesday is Constitution Day, I thought we could organise something on Monday to convey the message that the MLAs of three parties would not let the principles of Constitution be destroyed in Maharashtra,\u201d Awhad said.<\/p> <p>He discussed it with Milind Narvekar, secretary to Uddhav Thackeray. Narvekar spoke to Thackeray and got his approval. Meanwhile, Awhad spoke to Pawar who supported it. Once both the top leaders agreed to the plan, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat too was called for his opinion and he agreed to come on board. The idea was discussed around 11.30am and within a few hours the organisers made it reality.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe original plan was to conduct it at Chaityabhoomi, Dadar, but the NCP supremo said it would not be feasible.

I have taken written opinion from former senior officers who have worked in Parliament and in the Maharashtra Legislature that once a leader is removed from the position (legislative party leader), he cannot issue a whip,\u201d said Pawar. There are reports that Ajit Pawar may issue a whip asking NCP legislators to vote for the BJP and if not followed, the legislators may get disqualified.<\/p> <p>Pawar also invoked Maharashtra pride. \u201cThis is Maharashtra, we won\u2019t tolerate anything here. We can teach a lesson [to the BJP],\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray warned the BJP not to indulge in misadventure against their three-party coalition. \u201cIn the past 30 years, you have only seen our friendship.

Enraca initially denied any involvement in the shootings but confessed soon after he was arrested.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to the Las Vegas Review Journal, a second Filipino, Ralph Simon Jeremias, was sentenced for the \u201cexecution-style\u201d shootings of Paul Stephens and Brian Hudson in 2009. Jeremias said the victims were already dead when he came to the apartment complex to buy marijuana. Two of his friends disputed this account and said Jeremias entered the building alone and shot the two men multiple times, according to the news report.<\/p> <p>As stated on the website, a \u201cforeign national\u201d is an individual who does not possess U.S. citizenship. They would generally include \u201ctourists and visitors, migrant workers with temporary permits, resident aliens, undocumented aliens, asylum-seekers, and persons in transit.\u201d<\/p> <p>The data provided may not be accurate because of the difficulty of ascertaining the nationality of death sentence persons, and the criteria for determining nationality vary from state to state.<\/p> <p>\u201cCompounding the problem is the still-widespread failure of U.S. law enforcement officials to notify detained foreigners of their consular rights. Without this notification and subsequent communication at the request of the detained national, foreign consulates in the United States are likely to remain unaware of the true number of their nationals who are imprisoned, let alone sentenced to death,\u201d states the website.<\/p> <p>Support for capital punishment is waning because of several cases of mistaken convictions and a disproportionately high number of Black suspects in incarceration. This has led to several states abolishing the death penalty.<\/p> <p>Americans surveyed by DPIC have said that life in prison without parole is a \u201cbetter approach for punishing murder than the death penalty.\u201d @The FilAm<\/p> <p>Subscribe to our newsletters!

Whatever your views on the BBC\u2019s future, you will find plenty of analysis and opinion. There are many articles that have already been written on this subject and no doubt a lot more will be said over the next weeks and months. My hope is that the high quality of much of its output will be maintained: as someone who spent many years abroad, I know that the BBC is still the envy of the world and one of Britain\u2019s biggest soft power assets. Comparing it to streaming services such as Netflix is absolute nonsense.<\/p> <p>What is often missing from discussions about the media landscape in Britain is the state of local media. And it is not good: since 2005, there has been a net loss of 245 local newspapers, and tens of thousands of jobs. As social media companies have continued to snatch advertising revenue from print newspapers, their circulation has fallen dramatically. The BBC currently funds local reporters and pools its resources with competitors to cover local news. If its funding is cut, it may no longer be able to do it.<\/p> <p>This should worry us all, not just journalists: how will scrutiny of local authorities work in a world without local media? A social media company is not going to step in and send its employees to report from a magistrate court or county council. Local papers have long been the place where some of the best reporters learnt their craft, so while you can argue that the cream always rises to the top, if you reduce the number of places where aspiring young journalists can develop their skills and make a living, many will simply do something else.<\/p> <p>National papers have fought back, with some success: The Times and the Sunday Times have more than 300,000 digital subscribers, and the Guardian recorded an operating profit for 2018-19, its first such profit in two decades. But they are facing a challenge of attracting new, younger subscribers who don\u2019t remember a pre-internet world and may not understand how crucial the Fourth Estate \u2013 the press \u2013 is to upholding a healthy democracy. Investigative journalism fulfils the essential function of holding the powerful to account and exposing scandals and corruption, at both national and local level. Oppressive regimes always crack down on independent media, imprison journalists and control public broadcasters, because journalism\u2019s core value is impartiality. All citizens, most of all politicians, need to hear diverse views, not just the views of which they approve.<\/p> <p>So what\u2019s to be done? The generation now reaching adulthood, dubbed Generation Z, are \u2018digital natives\u2019, who have little exposure to established news organisations.

to gauge the interests of Democratic voters, Wednesday\u2019s NBC Nightly News sat down with Senator and 2020 hopeful Amy Klobuchar (MN) and asked her how she would help to strengthen unions in America. While, at the same time, ignoring corruption charges against United Auto Worker bosses.<\/p> <p>Again, anchor Lester Holt was not shy about stating the purpose of the segment. \u201cWith another debate coming up this month, we're asking what's most important to Democratic voters and Harry Smith is taking their questions to the candidates. Tonight, Senator Amy Klobuchar in our series, what matters,\u201d he openly admitted.<\/p> <p>Correspondent Harry Smith was still speaking with the same group of Democratic voters in Pennsylvania as he did in the first installment, but this time the discussion was about labor:<\/p> <p>HARRY SMITH: How many union members or former union members? Five, six, seven. At our round table with Democratic primary voters. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I couldn't get into a union. I couldn't get health care.<\/p> <p>\u201cA clear desire for the return of union strength,\u201d he declared as if they were the oracles that knew what was best for the entire country.<\/p> <p>Moments later, Smith boasted: \u201chow Americans view unions has changed dramatically in the last ten years. Nearly two-thirds of adults in the U.S. now view unions favorably.\u201d \u201cBut union membership is at a decade's low, 10 percent of the U.S. workforce,\u201d he would go on to lament.<\/p> <p>With absolutely no attempt to provide any counterpoint, Smith teed up Klobuchar to preach to NBC viewers about how great unions allegedly were:<\/p> <p>SMITH: What goes through your mind? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN) That they\u2019re right. That they get it. SMITH: We talked with Senator Amy Klobuchar at home. To her, unions are a family matter. KLOBUCHAR: I literally am here as the granddaughter of a union member, an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and union member, the daughter of a newspaper-man and a union member.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have things that have gone awry. It is no surprise at all that you're going to see an increase in union organizing and increase in interest and popularity,\u201d she touted.<\/p> <p>But while Smith and Klobuchar were singing the praises unions, it was just this past August when the FBI raided the homes of United Auto Workers\u2019 leadership as part of a corruption probe. NBC viewers didn\u2019t learn about that story because they (along with ABC) refused to cover it.<\/p> <p>CBS correspondent Dean Reynolds noted at the time that the \u201cFBI raids today on the homes of Gary Jones, the current president of the United Auto Workers; and Dennis Williams, his immediate predecessor\u2026\u201d Reynolds added that the raids \u201csignaled a drastic escalation of a four-year probe into illegal payments to union officials.\u201d<\/p> <p>Earlier Wednesday, CNBC reported online that UAW leaders were still being charged with corruption. \"Federal prosecutors have charged retired United Auto Workers Vice President Joseph Ashton, a former board member of General Motors, as part of its corruption probe into the union,\" Michael Wayland reported. \"Ashton was charged Wednesday in a criminal information filing, which indicates a guilty plea is expected.\"<\/p> <p>A Democratic debate was coming up, but, as they would surely note for President Trump, they\u2019re running to be president for ALL Americans.

The government strategy takes the election to the last possible day for votes to be cast in a standard half-Senate election on a Saturday, maximising the length of the formal campaign in the hope Mr Albanese will crumble under pressure.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is a choice between a strong economy and a Labor opposition that would weaken it,\u201d Mr Morrison said. Loading His advisers have been frustrated for months at what they regard as a lack of scrutiny of Mr Albanese and his policies, but their attempts to shine a spotlight on the Labor leader have been undone by the disunity within the Liberals including attacks on the Prime Minister\u2019s character. The government\u2019s challenges were highlighted on Sunday when Mr Morrison was asked about the status of former education minister Alan Tudge, who stood aside earlier this year over questions about his relationship with a former press secretary, Rachelle Miller. Asked if Mr Tudge would be restored to federal cabinet, Mr Morrison responded by saying \u201cAlan Tudge is still in my cabinet\u201d and countering the assumption the minister had been sidelined.<\/p> <p>The Prime Minister is preparing to name a new minister to the health portfolio this week so Australians will know who would take over the post from Health Minister Greg Hunt, who is leaving Parliament at this election.

Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between a government you know and a Labor opposition that you don\u2019t.\u201d Mr Albanese bristled at questions on Sunday that suggested he had not unveiled enough of his policies, pointing to the climate change policy he outlined last December with estimates it would support 604,000 jobs by 2030. The policy requires spending $24 billion on new infrastructure while capping greenhouse gas emissions at large enterprises. Mr Albanese sought to remind voters of Mr Morrison\u2019s attack on Labor at the previous election for setting a target to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf you fear the present you have no chance of shaping the future,\u201d he said. Assuring voters he had an agenda for the next term of Parliament, Mr Albanese listed policies such as a $2.5 billion aged care plan to hire more nurses and lift standards, a childcare policy to increase rebates for families, a national integrity commission with stronger powers than the government\u2019s model, a $10 billion fund to invest in affordable housing and a reconstruction fund for manufacturing. He emphasised industrial relations as a field where Labor would act in government to encourage the Fair Work Commission to set higher pay rates. \u201cWe will have a policy of lifting people\u2019s wages through the changes that we announced almost two years ago for industrial relations,\u201d he said, \u201cmaking sure that secure work is an objective in the Fair Work Act, properly defining casualisation, having same job, same pay, making wage theft a crime, closing the gender pay gap. \u201cWe have outlined a series of policies for the election. Mr Morrison has not outlined any agenda for another term.\u201d<\/p> <p>The campaign has already been under way before its official announcement. Both leaders have been crossing the country over the past week. Mr Morrison has visited the Labor seats of Corio and McEwen in Victoria, both just outside Melbourne, as well as Lyons in Tasmania, Parramatta in western Sydney and Dobell on the central coast of NSW.
