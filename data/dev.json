[{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":973494593,"Input.title":"Over 300 Girls Kidnapped In Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara State","Input.publish_date":"2021-03-08 23:00:34","Input.article_interface":"<p>In the early morning of February 26, 317 girls were kidnapped in the Zamfara state of northwestern Nigeria. The girls were taken by their captors from the Government Girls Secondary School in the town of Jangebe and marched into the forest at gunpoint. The kidnappers had entered Jangebe with an explosion of gunfire, scaring off residents while conducting the abduction and killing a police officer in the process. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, are increasingly using mass kidnappings in attempts to extort ransom and are the expected culprit. A heavily armed search and rescue operation ensued, with both ground and aerial units deployed, and the kidnapped girls have since been released. This event is the latest in a string of kidnappings of schoolchildren in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Among others, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres denounced the kidnapping. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari also condemned the action, calling it \u201cinhumane,\u201d according to the BBC. Buhari has gone on record stating that his administration will not give in to blackmail by groups that target innocent school children. Despite his repeated condemnations, however, many have criticized his government\u2019s continued inability to prevent these incidents. Although authorities deny any negotiation with militants, a variety of armed groups have been conducting more and more mass kidnappings for ransom. That the mass abduction of children is seen as a way to secure payment is evidenced by the increased targeting of schoolchildren.<\/p> <p>The kidnapping in Zamfara state was Nigeria\u2019s second mass abduction of schoolchildren in under two weeks. Nine days prior, 42 people, including 27 students, were kidnapped in Niger state in north-central Nigeria and one student was killed in the process. Only a few months ago, in December 2020, more than 300 schoolboys were kidnapped by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the northern state of Katsina. The boys were rescued by security forces and the 27 recently kidnapped students were released a day after the Zamfara abduction.<\/p> <p>Overall, security in northern Nigeria has been worsened by the heightened activity of armed groups, including the increased frequency of mass abductions. Kidnappings such as these have become especially common in the region, making families extremely fearful for the safety of their children in schools. Boko Haram has been widely acknowledged to carry out school kidnappings, including the example of the 276 girls abducted from Chibok in 2014, which captured worldwide attention. However, the practice has been increasingly adopted by other militant groups, conveying a worrying trend. According to Al Jazeera, in Zamfara state, abductions for ransom and village raids by gunmen are a regular occurrence.<\/p> <p>Not only do these attacks risk the lives of children but, even if returned, their quality of life may be forever affected. Kidnappings put children at risk of never returning to school out of fear that school is too dangerous. The three mass abductions since December are a worrying sign for the safety of schoolchildren and for the region\u2019s security, leading to many calls on the state and federal governments to make repressing armed groups and ensuring the safety of children in schools a top priority.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"3GVPRXWRPJ9LKU4775X06AZYEV97I8"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1037,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":"26.0","city":"None","region":"Zamfara","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"girls, kidnappings, police officer, school","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other"],"year":"2021.0","month":"02","date":"26.0","city":"None","region":"Zamfara","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"girls, kidnappings, police officer, school","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1026882858,"Input.title":"Olympics-Athlete hailed by Uyghur advocates for \u2018East Turkestan\u2019 flag","Input.publish_date":"2022-02-06 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By Karolos Grohmann and Mitch Phillips<\/p> <p>BEIJING (Reuters) \u2013 A ski jumper at the Winter Olympics was hailed by advocates for Uyghurs on Sunday after displaying what they said was the flag of the independence movement of East Turkestan, a group Beijing says threatens the stability of its Xinjiang region.<\/p> <p>Turkey\u2019s Fatih Arda Ipcioglu on Saturday competed in light blue-coloured skis with a white crescent and white star on them.

As millions of people were demonstrating against the government across India on Thursday, tens of thousands of public sector workers and employees in Greece also went on a nationwide 24-hour general strike.<\/p> <p>They were protesting against the devastating coronavirus policies and demanded better protective measures, the confiscation of private hospitals, mass hiring of health workers and salary increases. This week, the total number of infections in Greece exceeded the 100,000 mark and the death toll rose to over 2,000. Given the overcrowded intensive care units in northern Greece, patients had to be transported to Athens by a special flight for the first time.<\/p> <p>Students demonstrate on 1 October, 2020, for measures to protect them from the coronavirus and for higher spending on education.(Source: Face-book\/COVID-19 Solidarity\/Menoume energoi)<\/p> <p>The strike was also directed against the authoritarian attacks of the state in the spirit of the military junta, which brutally ruled the country from 1967 to 1974 with the support of NATO. Demonstrators demanded the immediate withdrawal of the draft for a new labour law that would abolish the eight-hour day and drastically restrict the right to strike and demonstrate.<\/p> <p>While the General Confederation of Trade Unions (GSEE) collaborates closely with the government during the pandemic, the Public Services Union (ADEDY) and the Public Hospitals Union (POEDIN) had called for the strike to try and keep the resistance under control. In addition to doctors, nurses and public employees, transport workers, dockworkers, journalists, teachers and cultural workers also took part in the strike. Ports, the subways and the electric train in Athens stood still. Strikers from all over the country gathered in front of hospitals, observing the coronavirus safety measures.<\/p> <p>In downtown Athens, small rallies were held in front of the Labour Ministry and the Health Ministry. A large police force was deployed to intimidate the protesters.<\/p> <p>Athenian artists rode in a motorcycle protest convoy past the hospitals to the Health Ministry. \u201cPolice everywhere\u2014intensive care beds nowhere\u201d and \u201cMoney for health, not for Aegean Airlines [largest Greek airline]\u201d were written on their posters. With these slogans, they denounced the class politics of the government, which is putting vast sums into big business and increasing the repressive powers of the state, while the public health system is falling apart.<\/p> <p>Air traffic controllers also wanted to down tools but were prevented from doing so by court order shortly before the strike began. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Transportation had gone to court against the strike in the aviation industry and was granted an injunction. The airlines celebrated and announced flights would operate normally.<\/p> <p>In the last weeks and months workers, students and young people had taken to the streets against the government under the right-wing conservative New Democracy (Nea Dimokratia, ND). In early April, at the beginning of the pandemic, doctors and nurses protested nationwide. In the summer, thousands demonstrated against the massive restrictions on the right to demonstrate. In September and October, thousands of students occupied over 700 schools, demanding huge investments in education rather than the military.<\/p> <p>In mid-November, hospital workers again organised protest actions as part of a \u201cNational Action Day for Health.\u201d Students at the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki occupied the rector\u2019s office to draw attention to the dangerous conditions in their student residences. They demanded mass tests, better cleaning and safety measures against COVID-19. The Health Ministry ignored the demands and sent in the police instead to suppress the protests.<\/p> <p>The growing strikes and protests by the Greek working class and youth raise fundamental political questions. Few countries in recent years have experienced as many general strikes as Greece. Whenever the pressure becomes too great and the wrath of the workers threatens to break out uncontrollably, the unions resort to general strikes and ensure that resistance is channeled into a dead end. They deliberately prevent a European-wide and the international unification of the struggles, although the pandemic makes a worldwide response by the working class necessary.<\/p> <p>The general strike covered only the civil service and was limited by the organisers to a purely national framework. The calls for the strike by the trade unions and pseudo-left organisations associated with them, such as the Stalinist Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the Antarsya alliance, contain no reference to the international situation, nor make an appeal to the European working class or demand the closure of all non-essential production with payment of full wages to protect all workers from the virus. The union officials do not articulate the interests of the workers but speak for prosperous sections of the middle classes who fear a revolutionary movement of the working class like the devil fears holy water.<\/p> <p>It is significant that Syriza, the largest pseudo-left organisation in Greece and nominal leader of the parliamentary opposition, has effectively blacked out the general strike. There was no official strike call, let alone a statement by party leader Alexis Tsipras on Twitter or YouTube. Tsipras hurries from one hospital to the next to have his picture taken with doctors and nurses and to pretend to support them. But Greek workers know only too well what these false statements and empty phrases mean. They experienced it first-hand when Syriza, with Tsipras as prime minister, implemented the austerity dictates of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank when in government for four years. Syriza imposed massive cuts in health, education and social services.<\/p> <p>Now, the pseudo-left party essentially acts as a loyal parliamentary opposition. On Thursday, the day of the general strike, Syriza representative Giorgos Katrougalos met with Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, who informed him about the new strategic partnership with the United Arab Emirates. Katrougalos, who was himself Foreign Minister in 2019 and who implemented drastic pension cuts in 2015 as Labour Minister, welcomed the cooperation with the Emirates. When he criticised the government, he did so from the right. A foreign policy \u201cstrategy\u201d was lacking and \u201cclear red lines\u201d against neighbouring Turkey were needed, the Syriza politician said. Both sides agree on the need for a more aggressive imperialist policy, which of course requires billions in arms expenditures.<\/p> <p>On the domestic front, too, Syriza and the unions agree in essence with the government\u2019s course and play a key role in pushing through the deadly herd immunity policy against enormous resistance.<\/p> <p>Although the pandemic situation in Greece is currently on a knife-edge, the government wants to gradually lift the lockdown on December 7. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Education Minister Niki Kerameos declared that the first thing to do was to reopen schools. In an interview with RealNews, Kerameos again claimed that children were less likely to be affected by the virus. Elementary schools had only been closed to limit social mixing and traffic by parents, he said.<\/p> <p>Children are to be brought back to classrooms in the middle of winter, despite exploding coronavirus numbers, so that their parents are available for the job market. At the same time, the government has hardly spent any money to make distance learning technically and financially feasible for all students.<\/p> <p>The dangerous reopening of schools is also supported by the teachers\u2019 union OLME, which wants to link it only to certain safety precautions. In its call for a strike, OLME demands more education spending and the \u201cnecessary measures for running open schools under safe health conditions.\u201d During the demonstration, the trade unionist P. Saraidari criticised the government for not carrying out mass tests and increasing staff, but said, \u201cWe believe that schools must be open, with safeguards.\u201d<\/p> <p>Syriza uses the cynical argument of child welfare to promote open \u201csafe\u201d schools, criticising the government for having \u201cno plan\u201d for education. \u201cThe school closures shows the bankruptcy of the Ministry of Education,\u201d Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group on education wrote in a statement in early November. Because of the \u201csocial discrimination\u201d in the pandemic, \u201cwe must all try not to alienate children from the educational and social environment of the school and to return students to in-person classes under safe and educational conditions.\u201d While Syriza speaks of \u201csocial discrimination,\u201d the organisation was responsible for trampling on \u201cchild welfare\u201d with its austerity policies and stole the future from a whole generation of young people.<\/p> <p>The second wave of the pandemic finds a society that has been destroyed by the EU\u2019s austerity dictates over the past ten years. While Greece\u2019s oligarchs withdraw to their yachts and luxury villas, rejoicing in their rising share prices, most families are defenceless and at the mercy of the pandemic. Death, unemployment, low wages, poverty pensions, lack of prospects\u2014this is the bleak reality that drives masses of people to the barricades again and again.<\/p> <p>But a real struggle for social equality and the containment of the pandemic requires that Greek workers and youth go beyond the framework of the worn-out trade union nostrums and form their own rank-and-file safety committees, independent of all bourgeois and pseudo-left organisations and unite across national borders. Workers and young people need a socialist programme to settle accounts with the criminal coronavirus policy worldwide. Big business and the banks must be expropriated, capitalist governments overthrown in the fight for a society that puts health and life before the profits of the oligarchs.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3VMHWJRYHXVVPI88OAVDXCZU0TTXFT"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1329,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"10","date":"1.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Greece and India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, working class, covid, strike, students","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"10","date":"1.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Greece and India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, working class, covid, strike, students","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":984146833,"Input.title":"Attack on Ex-Maldives\u2019 President Shows Cost of Impunity","Input.publish_date":"2021-05-10 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Click to expand Image Maldivian police officers secure the area following a blast in Male, Maldives, Thursday, May 6, 2021.

He was arrested in 2011 because he called attention to a planned strike by Beijing taxi drivers.<\/p> <p>In 2014, he interviewed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Beijing and asked for America to help \u201cfreedom-loving Chinese\u201d tear down \u201cthe Great Firewall of censorship\u201d constructed by the Chinese government.<\/p> <p>Zhang also asked Kerry to visit the wife of dissident Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Prize-winning human rights advocate and political prisoner who died of liver cancer three years later while under guard in a Chinese hospital, his wife cruelly held under house arrest and kept silent while he wasted away.<\/p> <p>Kerry later asked the regime in Beijing to go easier on censorship and show some compassion for its political prisoners, but nothing came of either request. Kerry claimed his meeting with Zhang and three other Chinese bloggers was the first time he was told American tech companies were helping the Chinese government control Internet access.<\/p> <p>Zhang was subsequently fired from his job as a journalist and editor by online giant Tencent, ostensibly for \u201cleaking business secrets and other confidential and sensitive information.\u201d<\/p> <p>Zhang said he was told by his department head that he was fired for the \u201cradical statements\u201d he made to Kerry, and for exposing CCP propaganda directives. One of those directives forbid all Chinese media for reporting what was said during Kerry\u2019s meeting with Zhang and the other bloggers. The U.S. State Department said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and \u201cvery troubled\u201d that Zhang was fired after talking to Kerry.<\/p> <p>Zhang tried to keep writing without his Tencent position, working to expose the scale and brutality of Chinese censorship, which he warned was growing steadily worse under the leadership of dictator Xi Jinping. He published an article at Foreign Policy in April 2014 ridiculing the CCP\u2019s claims that its growing censorship drive was aimed primarily at cleansing pornography from the Internet:<\/p> <p>The party has long controlled the media. One lever for doing so has been legal ambiguity; China does not have clear regulations governing news, and so it\u2019s unclear when a line has been crossed. The goal of the new campaign is to move the line again, putting pressure on the rights of reporters and netizens who wish to express their own opinions. It\u2019s a method of speech control we\u2019ve seen all too often. Ever since President Xi Jinping came to power in November 2012, central authorities have been tightening the net, detaining a growing number of reporters and netizens. Shortly after Xi took the reins, the CPD prohibited \u201cforeign media personnel\u201d from \u201cirresponsible\u201d Weibos, meaning micro-blog postings, and ordered that certain websites be subject to \u201cmanual review\u201d and strict regulation. The goal was to control the flow of information between Chinese netizens and foreigners. And the CPD is trying to smother mentions of Xu Zhiyong \u2014 it issued a Jan. 26 order prohibiting anything that \u201chypes\u201d the civil society organizer, who was sentenced that day to four years in prison for the spurious charges of \u201cassembling a crowd to disrupt order in a public place.\u201d \u2026 The Chinese constitution explicitly provides for freedom of speech \u2014 but in practice, authorities don\u2019t respect that right at all. China\u2019s Criminal Law already criminalizes \u201cinciting others to overthrow national authorities\u201d and other types of speech. Chinese authorities have erected the so-called Great Firewall of Censorship to keep out foreign social and mainstream media like Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube, not to mention the New York Times.<\/p> <p>His final blog post was published in 2014, but he has been active on Twitter, which is forbidden to Chinese citizens but routinely used by CCP officials, Communist Party internet operatives, and bot networks to spread their propaganda. Vice News noted on Wednesday that official CCP accounts on Twitter have tripled over the past year and their activity has increased by 400 percent, a surge that appears to have been triggered by the protest movement in Hong Kong and intensified as the CCP attempts to control the worldwide political narrative of the Wuhan coronavirus.<\/p> <p>Zhang\u2019s last Tweet was in June, when he posted a photo of his one-day-old daughter in her hospital cart with the message, \u201cEvery life is precious\u201d:<\/p> <p>Zhang\u2019s wife Shao Yuan told Philippine news site Rappler that her husband was taken in for \u201cquestioning\u201d about \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking troubles\u201d on the evening of August 13. She was not told until the following morning that he was under arrest and has not seen him since.<\/p> <p>Shao said she did not \u201cunderstand the reason for this sudden detention,\u201d as her husband had not written a blog post in years and last used Twitter a few months before his arrest.<\/p> <p>\u201cZhang wasn\u2019t able to find any stable work after he lost his job at Tencent.

In effect, it would be a lingering sentence of death. And what grave crime might fit such a punishment? The crime of publishing the truth.<\/p> <p>Ten years ago, Assange worked with whistleblower Chelsea Manning to reveal U.S. misconduct and share it with the world. In short, he did what any respectable journalist should do: He shone a light on secrets that the U.S. government would rather keep hidden but which the public had an absolute right \u2014 and an absolute need \u2014 to know.<\/p> <p>Because of Manning, Assange and WikiLeaks, we learned of unreported civilian casualties, war crimes, human rights violations, the killing of journalists and the U.S. military's efforts to cover up its misdeeds through misinformation. These revelations won numerous awards for helping to change the global conversation on the post-9\/11 wars.<\/p> <p>But while human rights organizations and journalism societies have heralded Manning and Assange for the work they did in the public interest, the U.S. government has sought to make examples of them. To hang them like dead magpies in the hedge as a dire warning to others.<\/p> <p>If the U.S. extradites Assange, it will set the dangerous precedent that journalists can be prosecuted merely for working with inside sources, or for publishing information the government deems harmful. As many experts have testified, this would be the death knell of investigative journalism. It would become nearly impossible for a free press to fulfill its obligation to inform the citizenry, challenge government secrecy, expose concealed wrongdoing or share any information that might embarrass those in power.<\/p> <p>Citizens throughout the world should consider the important role that knowledge plays in democratic life. Knowledge makes us who we are, enables us to understand our fellow citizens and encourages us to grow. Without access to information, our power to express our will at the ballot box is weakened. And our access to information depends on the right to free expression.<\/p> <p>The U.S. military and its partners have been at war for nearly two decades. These wars have cost millions of lives and displaced at least 37 million people. We know that our governments, through bias, incompetence or manipulation, have played fast and loose with the truth about these wars. An independent press is the only safeguard we have against government deception. We should always celebrate brave whistleblowers and journalists committed to sharing with us the information we need to be responsible citizens. The information that Manning leaked and Assange published was true, released in the public interest, and never harmed anyone \u2014 unless damaging the reputations of public officials constitutes harm.<\/p> <p>Right now, with the connivance of Facebook, Google and Twitter, the U.S. government is attempting to dramatically reshape how we share information. It appears that the U.K. government is willing to help its closest ally and turn over Assange.<\/p> <p>So what to do now? I am sometimes accused of preaching to the choir. So be it. Choir \u2014 we are a very large choir, and in the name of truth and love and freedom we must raise our voices in unison, in a mighty choral roar to demand of the U.S. and U.K. governments that they end their war on journalism. That they dismiss the charges against Julian Assange and cancel the extradition proceedings in the kangaroo court in London. Certainly the future of democracy, and possibly the very future of life on earth, depends upon it.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3H781YYV6VXW2NZSOPAAQRTOBWRETA"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1123,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2010.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"London","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2010.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"London","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Julian Assange","victim_keywords":"wikileaks, arrested","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":932821058,"Input.title":"Burundi\u2019s President Ndayishimiye: new cabinet, new COVID strategy","Input.publish_date":"2020-07-02 08:40:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Two days after the burial of his predecessor, Pierre Nkurunziza, President Evariste Ndayishimiye announced his new cabinet, comprising of five women and ten men.

Things are not as they used to be at the NDLEA.<\/p> <p>On his first day in office on January 18, 2021, Marwa had already started wielding the big stick. It would no longer be business as usual he had warned everyone involved in the illicit drug business.<\/p> <p>He had said the agency would be overhauled and expanded, in line with the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Drug Abuse (PACEDA).<\/p> <p>The new chairman, who had served as chairman of PACEDA, said it will also be within existing financial constraints, and the authorization of the appropriate superior authorities.<\/p> <p>Marwa had said the number of drug users in Nigeria today is over 15 million people, across all ages, adding that the problem has eaten very deeply into the social fabric as every community in Nigeria is affected.<\/p> <p>He said as a lead agency in the drug war in Nigeria, they were familiar with the extent of the devastation that drug use has caused the nation, and vowed to resuscitate and reposition NDLEA to full active life, to be effective, respected and feared by concerned criminals.<\/p> <p>Read Also: Minister assures on creation of 100m jobs<\/p> <p>Many stakeholders had upon Marwa\u2019s assumption of office stakeholders had welcomed the development, describing him as a square peg in a square hole.<\/p> <p>For instance, the African Council on Narcotics has lauded the appointment, describing it as \u201cone of the best national appointments that has been made by the present administration.\u201d<\/p> <p>President of the Council, Rekpene Bassey, in a statement in Abuja said it was an appointment well deserved given Marwa\u2019s known track record of excellent performance in previous national appointments.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhile we feel certain that your present position will not be an exception, we note here the assurances of our prayers, trusting God will help you succeed in the massive task ahead considering the frightening increase in the illicit drug problem in our country. Needless to say, we will be more than delighted to work with your good self on this onerous task in the hope that you will leave the NDLEA better than you met it,\u201d Bassey had said.<\/p> <p>Marwa, it appeared, hit the ground running by summoning Commanders of the agency in all the states of the federation and special commands with marching orders to mop up illicit drugs across the country.<\/p> <p>He went ahead to distribute operational vehicles that had been lying fallow at the agency\u2019s headquarters for a long time, to some states that needed them.<\/p> <p>A flurry of drug busts and arrests on a scale hitherto absent had followed in the first month of his assumption of office.<\/p> <p>Seeming to want to identify with a more proactive spirit, various international organizations had already pledged their cooperation to the agency to achieve its mandate. Various alliances \u2013 national and international -have also been pursued by the Agency towards fighting the battle against drugs.<\/p> <p>Still in the spirit of building alliances towards the ultimate aim of ridding the country of the menace of drug abuse, Marwa recently visited the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Abuja, to explore areas of collaboration.<\/p> <p>In the meeting, the NDLEA Boss pointed out that as much as the agency\u2019s efforts were disrupting the drug supply chain through law enforcement, they also needed to be more proactive and work hard on drug demand reduction through advocacy programmes, which are mostly publicity driven.<\/p> <p>The visit, he said, was to leverage on the Minister\u2019s position to drive their advocacy programmes at little or no cost because it is well known that the NDLEA has over the years been left behind in terms of funding among other law enforcement agencies including those established years after them.<\/p> <p>Marwa however noted that despite their constraints, the Agency has in less than three months with him on the saddle, been able to seize drugs and cash worth over N75 billion.<\/p> <p>Within the period 2,175 drug traffickers had been arrested while 2,050,766.33 kilogrammes of assorted illicit drugs had been seized. Also 2,000 drug cases had been filed in court with 329 convictions and 1,549 pending cases, he revealed.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese figures are less than what could have been on the streets destroying the lives of innocent youths, our women and men. With the support of your office and those of your agencies, we\u2019ll be able to save millions of Nigerians from being afflicted with the menace of drug abuse,\u201d Marwa said.<\/p> <p>The NDLEA boss acknowledged the efforts of the Minister and leading agencies under him, in promoting the good work of the federal government and the country as a whole.<\/p> <p>\u201cNo doubt, the Minister\u2019s current role is central to all key activities of government and the agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration, especially with key information dissemination media outlets like the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), the Voice of Nigeria (VON) and more under the supervision of the Honourable Minister,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>He acknowledged that even without any prompting from the Minister, these agencies have been of tremendous support since he came on board.<\/p> <p>He said Nigeria is faced with a major drug crisis that is in no small way fueling most of the security challenges being faced in the North East, North West, North Central and indeed across the country.<\/p> <p>He noted that recently, through intelligence based operations, they were able to arrest some drug traffickers \u2013 one a Nigerien and another a Chadian in Niger state and Taraba state respectively \u2013 who supplied illicit drugs to insurgents and bandits.<\/p> <p>He again stressed the need to proactively combat the problem not just through enforcement but through advocacy.<\/p> <p>\u201cFor instance, we need to run a weekly 30mins network programme on NTA and Radio Nigeria to reach Nigerians on the dangers of drug abuse; we need to reach those at the grassroots with our messages in various Nigerian languages packaged in jingles; we need coverage of our programmes to promote the coming World Drug Day on June 26 and others.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to pay for all of these and this is why we need partnership with the Ministry of Information and its Agencies to be able to reach millions of Nigerians and save them from the drug scourge,\u201d Marwa appealed.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who assured the agency of support, commended Marwa for his impressive string of achievements, in less than three months of assuming office.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese achievements, I am reliably informed, include restoring the visibility of the NDLEA for local and international partnership; boosting the morale and confidence of staffers; attracting international support and \u2018offensive action\u2019 against drug cartels<\/p> <p>that has led to the arrest of 2,175 drug traffickers, seizure of 2,050,765.33 kilogrammes of illicit drugs as well as cash and drug seizures worth N75 billion,\u201d Mohammed said.<\/p> <p>Mohammed said the war against illicit drugs and tackling drug trafficking is one of the most important tasks in the country.<\/p> <p>This he said is because drug trafficking, money laundering by traffickers and the use of illicit drugs are closely linked to the nation\u2019s security, well being of the citizens, the moral fabric of our society and even governance.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is common knowledge that drug money can be used to finance insurgency and terrorism. A successful fight against drug trafficking will therefore help to deny or reduce funding for insurgency.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe kind of vicious banditry and kidnapping for ransom that our country has witnessed in recent times cannot be totally separated from illicit drug use and their effects on users who take to crime<\/p> <p>\u201cDrug trafficking proceeds are sometimes invested into legitimate businesses, making hard working and honest people look indolent.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat about the effect of drug trafficking on the moral fabric of the society. This society rarely questions the source or sources of people\u2019s wealth. That\u2019s why drug traffickers end up becoming role models in the society, with devastating consequences for our young ones.<\/p> <p>\u201cEven governance is not spared. Drug traffickers and money launderers contest and win elections into high offices, where they help shape policy. Just imagine the damage this can do to governance and indeed to any nation.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is why I want to once again commend Gen. Marwa for raising the bar in the fight against drug cartels and the use of illicit drugs with the new maxim, \u2018offensive action\u2019.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Information and Culture will work with you to give maximum publicity to your activities, especially in the area of advocacy. To date, we have launched a number of national campaigns. It will not be a bad idea for the Ministry, working with the NDLEA, to launch a national campaign against drug trafficking and use of illicit drugs.<\/p> <p>\u201cI will also encourage the NDLEA to work with the National Orientation Agency (NOA), which has set up Integrity Clubs in Secondary Schools nationwide, to reach the young ones with its campaign against drug use,\u201d he said.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"34KYK9TV2TNXGKATPY3UFERH6I3SB6"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":321,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2021","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"drug abuse, trafficker, Nigeria","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2021","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"drug abuse, trafficker, Nigeria","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":894350602,"Input.title":"Three French executives were convicted in the suicides of 35 of their workers","Input.publish_date":"2019-12-21 01:01:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Three former executives of a French telecommunications giant were found guilty on Friday of creating a corporate culture so toxic that 35 of their employees were driven to suicide in the mid-2000s.

Its ex-chief executive, Didier Lombard, was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $16,000, along with his former second-in-command and head of human resources.<\/p> <p>It is the first time a French company of Orange's size has been held to account for this type of workplace bullying.<\/p> <p>CFE-CGC Orange, a trade union that represents the company's workers, has been tracking employee suicides since 2007, and its leaders said they welcomed Friday's decision.<\/p> <p>\"Our thoughts are with the victims and the families of the victims of managerial violence put in place by Didier Lombard and his henchmen,\" S\u00e9bastien Crozier, the shop's president, said in a statement. \"We hope that this judgment will serve as an example so that this type of situation never happens again.\"<\/p> <p>Lombard and the two other former executives, the deputy Louis-Pierre Wen\u00e8s and the HR director Olivier Barberot, plan to appeal the ruling, reported the news station France 24. Orange will not.<\/p> <p>The spate of suicides, which happened more than a decade ago, came as the company underwent a massive restructuring effort. Then France's national telephone company, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com embarked on an aggressive plan to cut 22,000 workers and shift another 10,000 into new jobs - all between 2006 and 2008. Most of the employees, because they were civil servants, could not be fired.<\/p> <p>So, prosecutors said, the company's executives tried to make workers' lives so miserable they would leave voluntarily. Lombard, speaking to senior managers in 2007, reportedly vowed, \"I'll get them out one way or another, through the window or through the door.\"<\/p> <p>In the ruling, the court said \"the means chosen to reach 22,000 departures were illegitimate,\" the New York Times reported. It was \"a conscious scheme to worsen the work conditions of the employees in order to speed up departures\" and it \"created a climate of anxiety\" that led to the suicides.<\/p> <p>The employee deaths were often shocking and violent.

The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), first scheduled for June 2020 and rescheduled for June 2021, was eventually postponed indefinitely in May.<\/p> <p>\u201cRwanda\u2019s strategy to promote Kigali as a hub for meetings and conferences often means continued abuse of the capital\u2019s poorest and most marginalized residents,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cAs the meeting is rescheduled, Rwanda\u2019s Commonwealth partners have a choice: either speak up for the rights of the victims or be silent as the crackdown is carried out in their name.\u201d<\/p> <p>Following reports on abuses at the Gikondo transit center in 2015, 2016, and 2020, this practice was condemned during Rwanda\u2019s review by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, a Geneva-based treaty body, in February 2020. Between April and June 2021, Human Rights Watch interviewed via telephone 17 former detainees from Gikondo. Interviews with nine people who identified as transgender or homosexual, three women who were detained with their babies, four men who worked as street vendors at local markets, and a 13-year-old boy living on the streets in Kigali, confirmed that patterns of abuse that Human Rights Watch documented previously are ongoing. Due to fear of reprisals against interviewees, Human Rights Watch has withheld all identifying information.<\/p> <p>At Gikondo, detainees are held in overcrowded rooms in conditions well below standards required by Rwandan and international law. The former detainees said they have inadequate food, water, and health care; suffer frequent beatings; and are rarely allowed to leave filthy, overcrowded rooms. People were detained there without basic due process standards. None of the former detainees interviewed were formally charged with any criminal offense and none saw a prosecutor, judge, or lawyer before or during their detention. There were no measures to protect people from Covid-19, and former detainees said they did not have access to testing, soap, masks, or basic hygiene and sanitation amenities.<\/p> <p>People interviewed who identified as gay or transgender said that security officials accused them of \u201cnot representing Rwandan values.\u201d They said that other detainees beat them because of their clothes and identity. Three other detainees, who were held in the \u201cdelinquents\u2019\u201d room at Gikondo, confirmed that fellow detainees and guards more frequently and violently beat people they knew were gay or transgender than others.<\/p> <p>In the past, round-ups have been connected to high-profile government events, ahead of which security forces may ramp up efforts to \u201cclear up\u201d Kigali\u2019s streets. Human Rights Watch documented a similar round-up in 2016 before an African Union Summit held in Kigali. Ahead of the now postponed 2021 Commonwealth meeting, several former detainees said the police told them they did not want them on the streets during the event.<\/p> <p>A civil society activist in Kigali said: \u201cThe streets were empty before the meeting. You couldn\u2019t see any street children in town. Even the fruit vendors were taken [to Gikondo]. But now you can see them in the streets again.\u201d Sources in Kigali confirmed that fewer people were living or working on the streets in the month preceding the date for the meeting. Several former detainees said the conditions at Gikondo had worsened in the lead-up to the meeting due to severe overcrowding.<\/p> <p>An 18-year-old woman, a street vendor arbitrarily detained for two weeks with her 9-month-old baby, said: \u201c[The police] said the government wanted to clear the city because of CHOGM. They said they would detain us until CHOGM has happened without our filth on display.\u201d<\/p> <p>Rwanda is one of a few countries in East Africa that does not criminalize consensual same-sex relations. Vagrancy, begging, and sex work are not criminalized either. Yet the authorities continue to use Gikondo Transit Center to imprison people accused of \u201cdeviant behavior that is harmful to the public,\u201d including street vending and homelessness.<\/p> <p>Rwanda should urgently close the transit center in Gikondo and amend the legal framework governing the National Rehabilitation Service. The authorities should promptly investigate all reported cases of ill-treatment and beatings of detainees by police and transit center personnel \u2013 including reports of detainees dying in detention \u2013 and prosecute the suspected abusers, Human Rights Watch said.<\/p> <p>\u201cBased on past experience, there is every likelihood that similar patterns of abuse will occur ahead of whatever new date is set for the Commonwealth meeting,\u201d Mudge said. \u201cLocking up marginalized people and abusing them simply because the authorities believe they tarnish their country\u2019s image violates human dignity, and Commonwealth leaders should not tolerate this.\u201d<\/p> <p>Gikondo Transit Center<\/p> <p>Since 2017, legislation and policies under the government\u2019s strategy to \u201ceradicate delinquency\u201d have sought to legitimize and regulate so-called transit centers, presenting them as part of a \u201crehabilitation\u201d process aimed at supporting poor and marginalized people. The authorities acknowledge that there are 28 \u201ctransit centers\u201d in Rwanda, including \u201cKwa Kabuga,\u201d the unofficial name of Kigali\u2019s transit center situated in the Gikondo residential suburb of Kigali.<\/p> <p>Click to expand Image Satellite image showing the location of Gikondo Transit Center, Kigali, Rwanda.  Maxar Technologies 2020. Source: GoogleEarth<\/p> <p>A January 2020 Human Rights Watch report found that the 2017 legislation provides cover for the police to round up and arbitrarily detain people accused of so-called \u201cdeviant behaviors\u201d at Gikondo in deplorable and degrading conditions, and without due process or judicial oversight. Detainees are released with very little formal procedure, reflecting the arbitrary manner in which they were initially arrested.<\/p> <p>Based on the 2017 legal framework and statements by Rwandan authorities, the broader objective of Gikondo is to serve as a short-term screening center to allow authorities to process detainees to send on to rehabilitation centers. However, in practice, there is no judicial process to determine the length of time people spend at the center or whether they are released or transferred. Some people interviewed said they were released when the center was overcrowded. Two said they were released in June 2021, after the decision to postpone the Commonwealth meeting was announced.<\/p> <p>The 13-year-old boy said he was held for two weeks in late April and May, in a room with over 200 other street children, and was released after the announcement: \u201cThe police told us: \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid, children. The meeting isn\u2019t happening; you\u2019ll be released tomorrow.\u2019\u201d He said that district authorities collected all children detained at Gikondo and returned them to the streets of Kigali. He was not offered support to rejoin his family or return to school.<\/p> <p>The civil society activist confirmed that, \u201cChildren were detained, moto-taxis had to stop working, street vendors were harassed \u2013 all because of the Commonwealth meeting. Since it\u2019s been postponed, the abuse has calmed down.\u201d<\/p> <p>Former detainees said police told them that they were \u201ctrash,\u201d and that they would be detained during the meeting and released in August. \u201cBefore the [Commonwealth] meeting, they would arrest us and seize our goods,\u201d said a 20-year-old street vendor, who was detained for two weeks in April with her 9-month-old baby. \u201cWith this meeting coming up \u2026 Gikondo [was] very overcrowded.\u201d<\/p> <p>Arrest and Transfer to Gikondo<\/p> <p>Round-ups by police or officers from the District Administration Security Support Organ (DASSO), a local state security body, are often the first step toward arbitrary detention at Gikondo. The arbitrary nature of the detention is reflected in the complete absence of due process once people are taken to Gikondo. In most cases, detainees are held in various police stations or sector (local government) offices across Kigali before being transferred to Gikondo. None of the interviewees were taken before a judge or given access to a lawyer before being transferred to Gikondo.<\/p> <p>Detention of Gay and Transgender People<\/p> <p>The detention of transgender people at Gikondo was reported in the media in November 2020. The nine transgender or gay people interviewed by Human Rights Watch were detained at Gikondo between December 2020 and April 2021. They said they had been targeted due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and treated worse than other detainees.<\/p> <p>Several said the police or local security officers detained them after members of the public reported seeing them with their partners and other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, or wearing women\u2019s clothing if they were perceived not to be female. At Gikondo, police officers or guards accused them of being homeless, thieves, or delinquents and held them in a room reserved for \u201cdelinquent\u201d men. One 27-year-old transgender woman said:<\/p> <p>They took me at Kabuga and said I was causing problems in Rwanda\u2026. When I arrived, police asked why am I looking like this? Why am I looking like a girl? They asked: \u2018Are you a prostitute?\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I am a Rwandan.\u2019 They jailed me with other people who were [accused of being] thieves.<\/p> <p>One said he was arrested in late December 2020, after leaving a bar in Nyamirambo neighborhood in Kigali: \u201cWhen we were about to get on motorbikes, local patrol men came and asked us who we are and what we are doing here \u2026 they said we don\u2019t represent Rwandan customs. My friend [a transgender woman] has long hair and was wearing a skirt.\u201d Another former detainee was arrested by local security officials in February 2021 after kissing his same-sex partner in a bar. He said customers from the bar insulted them and called the security patrol, who took them straight to Gikondo transit center.<\/p> <p>Transgender and gay people interviewed described being harassed, insulted, and beaten by security officials during their arrest and detention. A former detainee who was arrested by DASSO officials in December 2020 said she was taken to the Nyabugogo police station. \u201cThey asked me what I was doing \u2026 if I am a girl or a boy,\u201d she said. \u201cI said I am a girl and that\u2019s when the problems started \u2026 At Kabuga, we were beaten by the leaders. They asked if we were boys or girls.\u201d<\/p> <p>A transgender woman detained at Gikondo in February 2021 said: \u201cPolice said we were cursed, and asked how we could behave in this way, having sex with people of the same sex as us. They said we\u2019re delinquents and put us in that room. But in the room, we were badly beaten by other detainees and police did nothing despite our cries.\u201d Another gay former detainee who was arrested with a group of transgender people said a policeman beat his feet and told him he should be \u201crehabilitated.\u201d<\/p> <p>Several other former detainees confirmed these patterns of abuse. An 18-year-old street vendor accused of \u201cdelinquency\u201d was detained with about 1,000 other men, where he said \u201cmen who dressed as women\u201d \u2013 referring to transgender people \u2013 \u201cwere beaten more than the others. We were all beaten but they were really badly beaten.\u201d All transgender women interviewed were housed in male facilities.<\/p> <p>Beatings<\/p> <p>Beatings often begin as soon as people are rounded up and taken to a nearby police station or post. A 30-year-old woman with a 3-year-old child said:<\/p> <p>I was taken to the police, where they kept us in a room with others who had been arrested. At that point we were violently beaten. I had a baby with me, but they still beat me, although they didn\u2019t beat him. At 2 a.m. they transferred us to \u201cKwa Kabuga.\u201d They told me: \u201cYour baby is none of our business. Get in with the others.\u201d I insulted them, so they beat me badly. They said they don\u2019t want me to do this kind of business [on the streets].<\/p> <p>Once detainees arrive at Gikondo, they are registered and often beaten by other detainees. Long-term detainees at Gikondo, known as \u201ccounsellors,\u201d are often in charge of daily life in the rooms and beat other detainees. The 30-year-old street vendor said that other detainees in the women\u2019s room beat her and her child: \u201cAn adult woman is hit twenty times, whereas her child will be beaten four times. It\u2019s only babies under one year old that are not beaten.\u201d<\/p> <p>Interviewees detained in the women\u2019s room also said they were beaten when their child defecated or cried: \u201cWe were beaten every day. We were also beaten when we asked for permission to use the toilet. If a baby cried, or urinated, its mother would pay the price,\u201d said the 23-year-old mother of a 2-year-old child, who was detained at Gikondo for three weeks in April.<\/p> <p>Guards or \u201ccounselors\u201d also regularly beat detainees in the children\u2019s room or rooms for adult men. Children are often beaten when they make noise or play together. \u201cWe were beaten a lot\u2026. If you fight, if you make a mistake, or if you shout, they beat you with sticks,\u201d the 13-year-old boy said. A 21-year-old street vendor held in the room for \u201cdelinquents\u201d said that detainees are beaten for spending too long in the bathroom, for talking too loudly, or \u201cfor any fault you commit.\u201d<\/p> <p>Conditions at Gikondo<\/p> <p>Conditions in Gikondo Transit Center, as Human Rights Watch has extensively documented since 2006, fall well below international standards and violate Rwandan law.<\/p> <p>Click to expand Image Rwandans sit in the Gikondo transit center in Kigali on September 24, 2015.  2015 St\u00e9phanie Aglietti\/AFP via Getty Images<\/p> <p>In March 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the UN Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture called on governments to \u201creduce prison populations \u2026 wherever possible by implementing schemes of early, provisional or temporary release.\u201d Yet Rwandan authorities continued to detain people in Gikondo transit center, without due process or judicial oversight. Overcrowding and poor hygienic and sanitary conditions at Gikondo put people at greater risk of contracting Covid-19 due to close proximity, inability to practice \u201csocial distancing,\u201d a lack of adequate sanitation and hygiene, and lack of adequate medical care, including a lack of Covid-19 testing.<\/p> <p>During their arrest and transfer to Gikondo, people interviewed said, they were not tested for Covid-19, were not given masks to wear, and were not given the space to maintain distances from other detainees. Many were taken to Gikondo in an overcrowded truck with windows closed. Some said that upon arrival, they washed their hands with water, but were not given soap. One former detainee said hand sanitizer was confiscated by the authorities upon arrival.<\/p> <p>Former detainees who were held at Gikondo between 2019 and 2021 estimate that between 50 and 200 girls and boys detained together at a time in the \u201cchildren\u2019s room,\u201d in deplorable and degrading conditions. But they described conditions in the room for male \u201cdelinquents\u201d \u2013 which also holds teenage boys \u2013 and facilities for adult women with their infants as far worse.<\/p> <p>In those two rooms, some children were held together with adults in severely overcrowded conditions and many detainees were forced to sleep on the concrete floor. Former detainees held in the room for \u201cdelinquents\u201d estimated that over 1,000 people were held together. One person interviewed said it was not possible to see the floor at night when the detainees attempted to lay down to sleep on the concrete floor.<\/p> <p>Most former detainees said they were given food once a day, in insufficient quantities and with poor nutritional value. Food is particularly insufficient for young children and babies, who regularly get sick. One woman said she was released after her baby got so ill he had blood in his stool, while another said her baby had to be transferred directly to a hospital due to malnutrition.<\/p> <p>Detainees in the rooms for women and \u201cdelinquents\u201d had irregular access to drinking water, sometimes only once a day. \u201cSometimes we go an entire day without drinking water, and then they give a tiny amount that we all have to share,\u201d said one interviewee who was held at Gikondo for almost all of April.<\/p> <p>Sanitation and hygiene conditions are very poor, and many interviewees reported being allowed to wash at most once a week. One former detainee said: \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to wash, they take a 20-liter basin and around 20 to 30 people wash at the same time.\u201d Former detainees said they were rarely given soap. The mother of a 3-year-old said: \u201cWe only washed once a day with filthy water that had worms in it, mostly without soap \u2026 we didn\u2019t change our clothes.\u201d<\/p> <p>Three interviewees said that during their time at Gikondo, they saw or heard of detainees who had died due to the poor conditions and lack of appropriate medical care. \u201cIn the two weeks I spent [at Gikondo] there were three nights where we couldn\u2019t sleep because there were too many people in the room,\u201d said a 40-year-old street vendor detained at the transit center in April. \u201cTwo people died because of this treatment and illnesses\u2026. They were ill and had diarrhea and skin rashes. They were refused permission to see a doctor, and one morning they were found dead. I don\u2019t know what caused their death or what their names are.\u201d<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch requested information on these allegations from the Justice Ministry and the National Rehabilitation Service but received no response and was not able to independently verify them.<\/p> <p>Lack of Government Response; Criticism by Regional and International Entities<\/p> <p>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which reviewed Rwanda\u2019s record on January 27 and 28, 2020, said it was concerned that the reference to \u201cdeviant behaviors\u201d in Rwanda\u2019s legislation was leading to \u201cthe deprivation of liberty of children in need of protection.\u201d The committee said the abusive detention should end and that the government should change the law.<\/p> <p>During the committee\u2019s review, the Rwandan government denied that the detention of street children in transit centers is arbitrary. The government also claimed that children in transit centers are either placed with a family or transferred to a \u201crehabilitation center\u201d within 72 hours. These claims contradict reports by the National Commission for Children and the National Commission for Human Rights, as well as Human Rights Watch findings.<\/p> <p>In response to the Human Rights Watch January 2020 report, then-Justice Minister Johnston Busingye was quoted in KT Press saying: \u201cThese children have been redeemed\u2026. We believe they can become useful citizens\u2026. HRW [Human Rights Watch] can come and interview them if they wish.\u201d During Rwanda\u2019s review by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the gender and family promotion minister, Soline Nyirahabimana, also said that independent observers should visit the center.<\/p> <p>On December 4, 2020, the African Court on Human and People\u2019s Rights held that states\u2019 laws enabling the detention of people who, often because of poverty, are forced to live on the street, violate human rights law. The opinion issued in response to a request by the Pan African Lawyers Union, upheld the rights of people deemed \u201cvagrants\u201d by the state. The opinion concluded that laws permitting the forcible removal or warrantless arrest of a person declared to be a \u201cvagrant,\u201d violate the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and other human rights instruments.<\/p> <p>On February 6, 2020, December 14, 2020, and August 23, 2021, Human Rights Watch wrote letters to then-Justice Minister Busingye following up on these statements, requesting access to Gikondo and other transit centers in Rwanda, and asking about steps taken by the Rwanda authorities to remedy the abusive legal framework governing its National Rehabilitation Service. He has not responded.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"37MQ8Z1JQGB0OTM65B28W7CETVJ2YL"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1096,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2021.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Rwanda","region":"None","country":"Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"gay, transgender people, sex workers, street children","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2021.0","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Rwanda","region":"None","country":"Africa","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"gay, transgender people, sex workers, street children","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":978874856,"Input.title":"Journalists on Trial for Covering Myanmar Coup","Input.publish_date":"2021-04-09 11:28:08+08:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>By May Kha<\/p> <p>YANGON - Preliminary hearings were held Tuesday for three journalists detained in Yangon on February 27 while covering protests of the military coup.<\/p> <p>The journalists \u2014 Aung Ye Ko, of the 7 Day Media; Hein Pyae Zaw of Zee-Gwet or \u201cOwl\u201d Media; and freelancer Banyar Oo \u2014 appeared in a prison court for the closed hearing, a lawyer representing them told VOA Burmese.

The boy and his family are refugees from the ongoing Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara. | Toufik Doudou \/ AP<\/p> <p>Last week\u2019s announcement that Morocco and Israel will establish diplomatic relations has reignited global attention on the freedom struggle of the Sahrawi people of Western Sahara.<\/p> <p>The Polisario Front, the national liberation movement of the Sahrawi, has been fighting for independence since 1975 when Western Sahara was invaded and occupied by Morocco. The organization\u2019s name is based on the Spanish acronym for Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and R\u00edo de Oro, two of the regions that comprise Western Sahara.<\/p> <p>In a deal orchestrated by the Trump administration, the United States will recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in return for Morocco\u2019s embrace of Israel. The pact reportedly also includes the sale of American weapons and drones to Morocco as well as $3 billion in commercial investments in the North African kingdom.<\/p> <p>As usual, Trump disclosed the agreement in a tweet punctuated with random capitalization and exaggerated adjectives. And, once again, Trump\u2019s deal positions the United States as a rogue nation that undermines international consensus and disregards human rights.<\/p> <p>The United Nations recognizes Western Sahara as a \u201cnon-self-governing territory\u201d and the Polisario Front as the genuine representative of its people. A 1979 UN resolution affirmed the Sahrawis\u2019 right to self-determination and independence. Today, dozens of nations around the world acknowledge the Sahrawi Democratic Arab Republic, established by the Polisario Front in 1976, as the legitimate government of Western Sahara, and since 1984, it has been a member of the African Union (then known as the Organization of African Unity).<\/p> <p>Oubi Bouchraya Bachi, spokesperson for the Polisario Front, condemned the Moroccan-Israeli agreement, declaring to the BBC Focus of Africa program: \u201cSovereignty over Western Sahara is a decision that should be taken exclusively by the Sahrawi people.\u201d<\/p> <p>Formerly colonized by Spain, Western Sahara\u2019s annexation by Morocco began in 1975, as the Sahrawi proclaimed independence. A 16-year war between the Polisario Front and Morocco ended in 1991 with a ceasefire agreement that included plans for a referendum on independence in Western Sahara.<\/p> <p>To this day, the referendum has not been held, despite numerous UN-mediated negotiations, partly due to disagreements over who is eligible to vote. Since the 1970s, Morocco has encouraged its citizens to move to Western Sahara and argues these settlers should be eligible to participate in the vote. The Polisario Front rightly insists a referendum on independence should be decided by the Sahrawis only.<\/p> <p>In 2007, the Moroccan government offered Western Sahara a limited degree of autonomy under Moroccan rule, another desperate effort to deny self-determination to the Sahrawis which was rejected by the Polisario Front. Morocco\u2019s ploy was reminiscent of France\u2019s proposal to West Africans in the late 1950s to accept semi-autonomy within a French-dominated union rather than immediate and complete independence.<\/p> <p>Today, a nearly 1,700 mile-long fortified sand wall separates Western Sahara into a Moroccan-controlled west, which includes the entire 500-mile-long Atlantic coast, and a Polisario Front-ruled east, bordering Algeria and Mauritania.<\/p> <p>Last month, Morocco violated the 30-year ceasefire by sending troops into a demilitarized, UN-monitored buffer zone along Western Sahara\u2019s southern border with Mauritania. Morocco claims Polisario Front activists were blocking a key highway that links the occupied territory with the rest of the African continent. Faced with this military incursion and decades of obstructing the referendum, the Polisario Front announced the resumption of armed struggle.<\/p> <p>According to the Financial Times, the Polisario Front\u2019s representative at the United Nations, Sidi Omar, explained: \u201cWe did not want this war but Morocco has been emboldened by the inaction of the international community.\u201d In the last few weeks, skirmishes between Polisario Front soldiers and Moroccan troops have been reported. Human rights groups have also documented arrests of peaceful, pro-independence protesters in Western Sahara by Moroccan occupation authorities.<\/p> <p>The Trump administration\u2019s reckless decision to recognize Morocco\u2019s claims to Western Sahara threatens to further destabilize a region that has been in turmoil since the NATO bombardment of Libya in 2011. Following the murder of Muammar Gaddafi in October of that year, Libya has been devastated by a brutal war, and much of the Sahelian zone of West Africa, particularly the nations of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria, has been terrorized by various Islamist groups.<\/p> <p>Trump\u2019s deal also risks antagonizing Algeria, one of Africa\u2019s major political and military powers and a key partner in the multinational alliance battling those terror groups in West Africa. In response to the Moroccan-Israeli agreement, Algeria\u2019s Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad stated: \u201cThere are foreign maneuvers which aim to destabilize Algeria.\u201d<\/p> <p>Algeria has long been a steadfast supporter of the Sahrawi struggle for independence and the foremost backer of the Polisario Front. About 180,000 Sahrawis live in refugee camps in the desert along the southwestern Algerian border with Western Sahara where the government-in-exile of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is based. Like Palestinian refugees in the nations surrounding Israel, the Sahrawis cling to the hope for a return to their homeland.<\/p> <p>Western Sahara is about the size of the United Kingdom, and its population is estimated at 600,000. The two-thirds controlled by Morocco includes the capital of Laayoune, where about a third of the population of Western Sahara resides. As an occupying power, Morocco exploits the wealth of Western Sahara, notably its significant reserves of phosphates as well as the rich fisheries off its Atlantic coast. In recent years, underwater oil and gas fields have been discovered along various portions of the West African coastline, and exploration has been conducted offshore Western Sahara, as well.<\/p> <p>Just like Israel, which builds Jewish settlements in areas of the West Bank that are designated as part of a future independent Palestine state, the Moroccan government continues to encourage Moroccans to settle in Western Sahara. The Moroccan and Israeli settlement schemes are deemed illegal by most of the international community. In both cases, the objectives are clear: to alter the demographic balance in favor of the occupiers and to prevent the implementation of agreements leading to independence. By recognizing Israel\u2019s designation of Jerusalem as its capital in December 2017 and Morocco\u2019s claims to Western Sahara last week, the Trump administration condones the forced seizure and continued occupation of disputed territory in violation of international law.<\/p> <p>Morocco is the latest majority-Arab nation in recent months to break tradition by establishing diplomatic relations with Israel in exchange for financial and military inducements from the Trump administration. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates were the first this summer but the deal brokered with Sudan in October has been opposed by the vast majority of Sudanese who resolutely support the Palestinian struggle, as well as some members of the United States Congress who disagree with terms they consider overly favorable to Sudan.<\/p> <p>Some observers have noted the establishment of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel merely makes official links that have long existed as an open secret, as they cooperate in military and intelligence matters. The two nations also maintained liaison offices in Rabat and Tel Aviv until 2000, when they were closed by the Moroccan government at the start of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada.<\/p> <p>Moreover, Israeli tourists are already permitted to travel to Morocco, where they are granted a visa upon arrival from third countries. About 50,000 Israelis visit Morocco annually, drawn to the nation\u2019s Jewish history and culture. The 3,000 Jews who live in Morocco today make it the largest Jewish community in North Africa. The agreement brokered by the Trump administration will facilitate direct flights from Israel to Morocco.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, opposition to ties with Israel and solidarity with Palestine is nearly universal in Morocco. Though they are united in supporting their nation\u2019s occupation of Western Sahara, several parties within Morocco\u2019s ruling coalition government as well as in its opposition have denounced the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel. The Moroccan ruler, King Mohammed VI, claimed in a statement that deals with Israel \u201cdo not in any manner affect Morocco\u2019s ongoing and sustained commitment to the just Palestinian cause.\u201d<\/p> <p>Although the Trump administration leaves Joe Biden with yet another diplomatic problem by recognizing Morocco\u2019s claims to Western Sahara, the Sahrawis remain optimistic about relations with the president-elect. Oubi Bouchraya Bachi, the Polisario Front spokesperson, told the BBC: \u201cWe are very hopeful the new administration will take a different step.\u201d<\/p> <p>International law and world opinion remain firmly on the side of the Sahrawis, but Trump has offered their Moroccan occupiers a parting gift that may inflame a longstanding conflict in a volatile part of the world.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3W3RSPVVGU6P86O95GNO8I5A3AGLUI"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":529,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2020","month":"December","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Western Sahara","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"pro-independence protesters, Sahrawi, Western Sahara","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":"2020","month":"December","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Western Sahara","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"pro-independence protesters, Sahrawi, Western Sahara","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"other"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":963820525,"Input.title":"Trade unionists detained in Turkey on 1000th day of resistance in fight for reinstatement","Input.publish_date":"2021-01-11 15:34:22","Input.article_interface":"<p>AT LEAST eight Turkish trade unionists sacked by global agricultural company Cargill were detained in Ankara today during a sit-in on their 1,000th day of action.<\/p> <p>They are demanding their jobs back after being dismissed for forming a workplace union in April 2018.<\/p> <p>Fourteen workers who decided to camp out overnight as part of a sit-in protest were set upon by police after a static demonstration at the Ministry of Agriculture & Forestry was blocked.<\/p> <p>They moved the protest to the food and auxiliary workers\u2019 union Tek-Gida-Is\u2019s offices in the Turkish capital, setting up log-burners to protect themselves from the cold and displaying a banner with the slogan: \u201cWe are in resistance\u201d on the street.<\/p> <p>But police threatened the trade unionists, saying: \u201cWe are the power of the state.

About 1,000 deaths annually are attributed to police actions in the United States, compared with about 600 annually in South Africa, but the U.S. population is more than five times larger.<\/p> <p>U.S. diplomats in Africa, in a series of unusual statements on social media, have been making a link between Mr. Floyd\u2019s death and security-force abuses in African countries. Brian Nichols, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe and himself an African-American, condemned the \u201cbrutal killing\u201d of Mr. Floyd and expressed \u201chorror\u201d at his death, but also cited six cases of Zimbabwean activists who were allegedly assaulted or abducted by Zimbabwean security agents in recent years.<\/p> <p>\u201cAs an African-American, for as long as I can remember, I have known that my rights and my body were not fully my own,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans will continue to speak out for justice whether at home or abroad.\u201d<\/p> <p>The lockdowns and curfews across Africa during the pandemic have further exposed the security-force abuses. While many African countries have won praise for their early interventions to reduce the spread of the virus, the toll of lockdown excesses by police and soldiers is still being counted today. Hundreds of people have been arrested, including journalists and political activists, in countries such as Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya and Cameroon.<\/p> <p>South Africa, with one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns during April and May, deployed thousands of soldiers to assist the police in enforcing it.

There are lessons to be learned from the Kremlin\u2019s nearly decade-long failure trying to combat the mujahideen in Afghanistan. Given Russia\u2019s incompetent but brutal war in Ukraine, now being directed primarily at hapless civilians, plus an already collapsing economy caused by international sanctions, it could also mean the end of Putin\u2019s ambitions for a new empire.<\/p> <p>When the Soviet 40th Army invaded Afghanistan on 27 December 1979, the Kremlin was \u201cresponding\u201d to a call for assistance by its new Afghan puppet, Babrak Karmal, who had been conveniently flown in from Czechoslovak exile only hours before. While Soviet military advisors had been on the ground ever since the communist April, 1978 \u2018Saur\u2019 revolution, the objective was to make it seem that Moscow had been invited in.<\/p> <p>The Russians specifically wished to get rid of Hafizullah Amin, the increasingly uncontrollable head of the country\u2019s ruling Khalqi faction, but they also wanted to take charge of the regime\u2019s failing efforts to put down rapidly spreading armed revolt.<\/p> <p>Not unlike Hitler\u2019s staged attack on August 31, 1939 by Germans dressed as Polish soldiers against the German transmitter at Gleiwitz to justify his Blitzkrieg, Moscow felt obliged to justify its takeover of Afghanistan, whose Islamist influences, it feared, threatened to undermine its own Central Asian Republics. By quickly occupying Afghanistan, the Russians believed, they could contain the problem. Little did they imagine that their failure to subdue this mountainous and desert country would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union, a factor that appears to have influenced President Vladimir Putin\u2019s current reasoning for re-asserting Russia\u2019s position in the world.<\/p> <p>Putin, who was already in charge in 1999, used similar language to justify his brutal military invasion of Chechnya to prevent the majority Muslim region from breaking away. His war resulted in the razing of Grozny, the Chechen capital. The Russian dictator has replicated similar justifications for his February 24 assault against Ukraine. Describing its population as \u2018vassals\u2019 and \u2018neo-Nazis\u2019 manipulated by NATO and the European Union, the Russian dictator not only perceives democratic Ukraine as a \u201csecurity risk\u201d, but a threat to his own ambitions for a new Russian empire. (See William Dowell article on Ukraine as Russia\u2019s Vietnam)<\/p> <p>Russia\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan failed in the long run<\/p> <p>So how does Afghanistan fit into all this? While many of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, notably the deliberate bombing of towns and fleeing civilians, reek of Chechnya-revisited, there are some lessons worth exploring.<\/p> <p>Not unlike Moscow\u2019s 41st Army push with an estimated 150,000 troops deployed from Russia and Belorussia in the north, but also annexed Crimea and the Black Sea in the south, the Red Army invaded Afghanistan with a 115,000-strong force. While the bulk of its troops crossed over from bordering Soviet Central Asia, airborne units within days took major airfields, such as Bagram, Kandahar and Shindand. As this writer can ascertain based on first-hand reporting, the Kremlin figured that such military might alone would suffice to intimidate the country\u2019s largely illiterate population and poorly armed rebels.<\/p> <p>The shock and awe invasion initially worked. Resistance was light and over five million Afghans fled the country, many of them during the first few months. Supported by Afghan government forces, including paid and often ruthless communist militia, the Red Army quickly established its control in the cities. Throughout Russia\u2019s nearly decade-long control, Kabul suffered only limited damage. Only a few specialized guerrilla fronts focused on urban assaults and assassinations.<\/p> <p>It was a different story in the countryside, where the mujahideen, or holy warriors as Afghan guerrillas were known, took their war. Operating from amongst the high mountains and rugged deserts, they fought an increasingly successful campaign of attrition by ambushing Red Army convoys and attacking forward bases. Outside military assistance in the form of weapons and funds provided by the CIA, Saudis, Pakistanis and others steadily strengthened their ability to fight, particularly with the arrival of US-supplied Stinger missiles \u2013 a gamechanger for the Afghan resistance \u2013 which forced Soviet MIGs and helicopter gunships to fly high and less effectively.<\/p> <p>The mujahideen basically made it impossible for the Soviets to assert themselves despite repeated major land and air offensives involving 12,000 troops or more against guerrilla strongholds. Frustrated, the Soviets destroyed over 22,000 villages forcing out civilians and turning farms into parched moonscapes by rupturing irrigation canals and killing off fruit orchards as a means of denying the resistance local support. They also laced the mountain passes, roads and farmlands with anti-personnel and other mines inflicting a devastating problem that has taken years to clear.<\/p> <p>Russian propaganda also perpetuated the myth of \u201cbrotherly friendship\u201d between the Soviet and Afghan peoples. While the East-bloc trained KHAD, the Afghan version of the KGB, stifled urban opposition, including demonstrations, through arrests, beatings and summary executions, Moscow sought to ensure the appearance of stability and progress \u2013 at least in the cities. It did this by subsidizing wheat and other food prices to the detriment of the Soviet economy. It also inaugurated \u2018modern\u2019 or refurbished apartment blocks, factories and hospitals, sometimes several times for television and PR purposes. As Red Army soldiers found to their astonishment, you could eat better in Kabul than back in the USSR.<\/p> <p>Russian president Vladimir Putin, according to human rights organizations, already a dictator and war criminal in the making.<\/p> <p>Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine: a poorly planned operation now resorting to killing civilians<\/p> <p>Similar developments have emerged in Ukraine. Nearly three million Ukrainians \u2013 mainly women, children and the elderly \u2013 have already fled as the Russians increasingly \u2013 and deliberately \u2013 bomb populated areas. \u201cIt\u2019s like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d recalled a former International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegate who was in Peshawar, Pakistan, when the first waves of Afghan refugees crossed the border. The Russians are also preventing humanitarian supplies from reaching besieged populations.<\/p> <p>While Afghanistan had a functioning communist regime largely willing to accept Russian backing, it seems unlikely that many Ukrainians except perhaps well-rewarded Quislings will collaborate openly with the invaders. Moscow-inserted officials in the now Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, for example, which is witnessing daily anti-Moscow demonstrations, have been seeking to interact with the local population only to find themselves ostracized. Even ethnic Russian-Ukranians have been criticizing the Putin regime. The invading Russians are now resorting to kidnapping or otherwise eliminating mayors and other municipal officials in captured towns and villages.<\/p> <p>According to the Melitopol\u2019s Ukrainian mayor, Ivan Federov, the Russians have been staging fake humanitarian food distributions for propaganda purposes using actors to portray concerned aid workers, but nothing is actually handed out. \u201cWe are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThey have not tried to help us\u2026and we do not want their help.\u201d<\/p> <p>Unlike the Afghans, whether the mujahideen fighting the Soviets or the Taliban against NATO, the Ukrainians have a different and less advantageous terrain to operate in. Their war will be fought more in and around the towns with bitter street and trench fighting using shelled buildings for cover not unlike, ironically, the manner with which the Germans and Soviets fought in Stalingrad. \u201cRussia\u2019s invasion has been incredibly badly organized and is now running into real trouble,\u201d noted a senior NATO officer. \u201cTheir desperation has become clear by their efforts now to make the lives of civilians hell.\u201d<\/p> <p>The independent Russian radio station Echo was recently shut down by the Kremlin and its FM wavelengths handed over to the government-run Sputnik network. Banning words such as \u2018war\u2019 and \u2018invasion\u2019, the Kremlin\u2019s repression of independent Russian and foreign press is forcing many to rely on official information sources, such as state television, which fail to provide the real picture of what is happening in Ukraine. (Photo: Wikipedia)<\/p> <p>Kremlin disinformation: preventing the truth from reaching Russians<\/p> <p>At the same time, while costly, Ukraine\u2019s war against the invaders has already proven highly effective, something that the Kremlin was not expecting. Russian forces have only been able to advance slowly against significant resistance, which has been blocking road access for fuel supplies given the number of destroyed tankers and trucks. For this reason, the Russians will probably persist with their air and long-range artillery assaults resulting in the steady destruction of Ukraine\u2019s towns leaving a massively devastated land in their wake.<\/p> <p>The Ukrainians, who already have been receiving western military assistance in the form of anti-aircraft missiles, including Stingers, and anti-tank weapons, have been taking a toll on Russian planes and helicopters. (The mujahideen, in contrast, had to wait several years for such weaponry). According to the Royal United Services Institute in London, at least 20 Russian aircraft have been visually confirmed as shot down, an indication that the Russians are struggling for air supremacy. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, which has admitted to suffering its own aircraft losses, claims it has downed nearly 60 Russian aircraft plus more than 80 helicopters.<\/p> <p>Russia\u2019s deliberate targeting of the city of Mariupol has already inflicted thousands of casualties and is preventing the arrival of humanitarian supplies. (Photo: ICRC)<\/p> <p>While such claims cannot be verified, the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP) has noted that if western intelligence is to be believed, the Russians are suffering considerable casualties, \u201cpossibly in their thousands, including at least two generals.\u201d The Pentagon is putting the figure at between 5,000-6,000, while the Ukrainians claim more than 12,000.<\/p> <p>The Kremlin, however, is not making the mistake as in Afghanistan by sending back dead soldiers in caskets and leaving it up to Soviet mothers to spread the word. This proved a crucial factor for building popular resentment to the war during the 1980s. As one BBC journalist noted, the Russians are also leaving their dead behind without bothering to remove them. Ukranians have been removing their weapons, videoing their remains and collecting their IDs to eventually inform Russians back home as to what is happening to their boys.<\/p> <p>With this conflict, however, Putin\u2019s troops are operating mobile incinerators. The last thing the Kremlin wants is to have closed coffins lined up on airport tarmacs appearing in social media. It is also keeping the official number of deaths low, 500 or so to date, and declaring them \u2018heroes\u2019, precisely what Moscow did throughout the Soviet-Afghan war.<\/p> <p>Unlike Afghanistan, where the bulk of Red Army soldiers were poorly trained conscripts, Russia\u2019s Ukrainian war is relying more on so-called \u2018contractors\u2019, soldiers who have signed up for longer than the one-year draft in return for better pay. Many, too, are Chechen mercenaries. Last week, the Kremlin announced that it was engaging Syrian \u2018volunteers\u2019 to help with its war.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, as recently captured Russian POWs have indicated in video testimony, many are still conscripts, while contractors are pointing out that their pay is too paltry to make joining the army attractive. Morale appears low. As occurred in Afghanistan, Russian soldiers, who have access only to official information sources, are saying that they did not know they would be invading Ukraine but had been told they would be on maneuvers in Belorussia.<\/p> <p>Afghanistan resulted in the collapse of the USSR. Is Ukraine the end of Putin\u2019s expansionism?<\/p> <p>As during the Soviet-Afghan war, the Kremlin has sought to control credible information. Given Putin\u2019s repressive crackdown of social media and outside news sources, such as the now banned BBC, but also its repression of Russia\u2019s own remaining outspoken press where the words \u2018war\u2019 and \u2018invasion\u2019 are banned, Ukrainian cyberhackers encouraged by the Kyiv government are ensuring that harsh realities from the front constantly interrupt official state media. As one source with the Cyber Security Forum in Geneva maintained, \u201cthe ultimate success of Ukrainian resistance may lie in its ability to completely hack the Russian system.\u201d Many Russians still have little idea about the realities of the Kremlin\u2019s ruthless war in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Initially, the Soviets in Afghanistan at least had the benefit of an Afghan army to work with. But as the occupation became more futile, thousands of Afghans deserted. Even senior Afghan officers within the high command collaborated with the resistance. The only ones the Russians could rely on were the paid militia, but even these readily changed sides the moment funds ran out. Red Army troops, too, soon realized how pointless the war was resulting in high alcoholism, drug addiction and depression. Not only that, but the war was proving financially draining, something that international sanctions against Putin\u2019s Russia and inner circles may be achieving.<\/p> <p>The whole purpose now of an effective resistance strategy by the Ukranians is to ensure that occupation simply becomes too costly \u2013 and pointless \u2013 to continue. The Soviet Union lost up to 25,000 dead during the Afghan war. Russia could face similar casualties in Ukraine. They will have achieved nothing, except, perhaps the demise of both Putin and his dream of a new, expansionist Russia.<\/p> <p>Edward Girardet is a foreign correspondent, author and editor of the Geneva-based Global Insights Magazine.

The authorities should release the two students immediately \u2013 unless they can promptly charge them with a recognizable crime \u2013 and ensure all their due process rights.<\/p> <p>The authorities arrested Ali Younesi, 20, on a Tehran street on April 10, 2020, then took him to his house with blood on his face to search his belongings, his sister told Human Rights Watch on May 29. His friend, Amirhossein Moradi, also 20, was arrested the same day, according to the Younesi family. On May 5, Gholamhossein Esmaili, the judiciary\u2019s spokesperson, accused the two students, without citing any evidence, of having ties to anti-revolutionary groups, including the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), and of pursuing \u201cdestructive\u201d actions.<\/p> <p>\u201cIranian authorities have a history of targeting dissidents\u2019 family members on bogus charges, and after nearly two months, they have failed to provide an iota of evidence against Younesi and Moradi,\u201d said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe prolonged solitary confinement, lack of access to a lawyer, and the judiciary\u2019s history of coerced confessions signal that there\u2019s almost zero chance that the due process rights of these two students will be respected.\u201d<\/p> <p>The MKO is an Iranian opposition group currently based in Albania. In 2005, Human Rights Watch documented abuses by the group against its own members when it maintained a presence in Iraq.

He said he was still being interrogated.\u201d The authorities have only allowed Younesi to make a few brief phone calls and have not permitted the family to visit, she said.<\/p> <p>The Iranian authorities have a history of targeting family members in Iran of those who have real or perceived ties with the MKO, a banned organization in Iran that was disarmed after the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003. According to Amnesty International, following the post-June 2009 election protests, the authorities arrested several people who had relatives with a past or current association with opposition groups, including the MKO.<\/p> <p>As recently as 2014, the authorities executed Gholamreza Khosravi, convicted of helping the group, on the charge of \u201cenmity against God\u201d in a case that was marked with serious due process violations.

For additional information, please see Human Rights Watch Country page on Uzbekistan: https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/europe\/central-asia\/uzbekistan.<\/p> <p>Related Content Submission by Human Rights Watch to the UN Human Rights Committee in advance of its review of Uzbekistan<\/p> <p>The government of Uzbekistan has taken some steps to address serious human rights abuses in the country since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev came to power in September 2016. Approximately 50 people imprisoned on politically motivated charges have been released and there is an increasingly vibrant media environment. In some cases, local officials were held accountable for abusive or corrupt actions.<\/p> <p>However, the government remains largely authoritarian and many promising reforms continue to exist only on paper. Thousands of people remain in detention on politically motivated charges. While the media environment in the country has become more open and competitive, self-censorship driven by credible fear of reprisal for being too critical or reporting on issues deemed politically sensitive is still prevalent. In May 2019, the government said it was unblocking access to several websites that had been blocked for many years, though many sites such as that of the Uzbek service of Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty remain blocked.<\/p> <p>In June 2018, the authorities adopted a new law on NGOs that would relax registration procedures. But the law has yet to be implemented effectively, and local officials have reportedly discouraged the registration of new organizations. They have also yet to remove the barriers to registration and accreditation of staff faced by international human rights organizations who were forced to discontinue their work in Uzbekistan following the 2005 Andijan massacre, including Freedom House, the American Bar Association, and Human Rights Watch.<\/p> <p>While there has been significant progress achieved, forced labor in Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton sector in 2018 continued despite a public decree prohibiting forced mobilization. The ILO estimates that approximately 170,000 adults were forcibly mobilized to pick cotton in the fields in the 2018 cotton picking season, while the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights and the Cotton Campaign believe the numbers of those mobilized could have been significantly higher. At the time of submission, neither the ILO nor the mentioned groups had published an analysis of the 2019 harvest.<\/p> <p>Consensual homosexual relations continue to be criminalized under Uzbekistan\u2019s criminal law and the country\u2019s LGBTI population suffers from deep-seated homophobia, persecution and discrimination.<\/p> <p>Prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 7)<\/p> <p>In November 2017, Uzbekistan\u2019s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a decree prohibiting the courts from using evidence obtained through torture, and requiring all legal decisions be based only on evidence confirmed during trial. The decree, which came into force in March 2018, states that prosecutors will be required to check whether physical or psychological pressure was exerted on a defendant or their relatives. If enforced, the decree could be an effective tool in helping to prevent torture and other ill-treatment in detention in Uzbekistan.<\/p> <p>However, many of the thousands of individuals still detained on politically motivated charges have been subjected to ill-treatment, torture, and terrible conditions of detention. Impunity largely persists and the Uzbek government needs to take credible steps to implement independent and impartial mechanisms to investigate allegations of torture and bring perpetrators to justice. Furthermore, the Uzbek government has not ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) and has not yet allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to carry out independent monitoring of Uzbekistan\u00b4s prisons and places of detention since it suspended its monitoring of facilities in 2013.<\/p> <p>Some cases include:<\/p> <p>Kadyr Yusupov, 67, who served as the country\u2019s head of mission to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), among other positions. On December 10, 2018, Uzbek security services detained Kadyr Yusupov, on charges of treason (Article 157) after he had been admitted to a Tashkent hospital for treatment concerning mental illness and held him in incommunicado detention from December through April. Security service officials denied Yusupov access to his attorney, Allan Pashkovskiy, and his family until rights groups and journalists began to openly raise his case in the media. The basis for the charges against Yusupov is unclear and several credible sources have told Human Rights Watch they believe the case is politically motivated. According to Yusupov\u2019s relatives, for four months following his detention, he was a victim of psychological torture that consisted of multiple daily threats of physical, including sexual violence, against him and his family. Yusupov\u2019s trial, which began in Tashkent on June 23, 2019, was closed to the public, including even his family members. On January 9, 2020, an Uzbekistan military court sentenced Kadyr Yusupov to five years and six months in prison for treason.<\/p> <p>Said-Abdulaziz Yusupov, director of the public foundation for the support and development of print media and information agencies. On May 10, 2019, Uzbek authorities arrested him on fraud charges. His wife Dilfuza Yusupova said that her husband suffers from deep-vein thrombosis and urgently requires medical care. Yusupov\u2019s brother released a video of Yusupov where he declares that the current case against him is retaliation for his peaceful journalistic work and support for the reform agenda of President Mirziyoyev. Yusupov\u2019s trial, closed to the public, began on September 9, 2019.<\/p> <p>Rashitjon Kadirov and Co-Defendants. Human Rights Watch and other organisations raised serious concerns in May 2019 over allegations that Rashitjon Kadirov, former Prosecutor General of Uzbekistan, and twelve co-defendants may have been tortured and suffered other forms of ill-treatment in custody. The trial of Kadirov and his co-defendants began behind closed doors on 7 January 2019 in Yunusabad District Criminal Court. Kadirov has been charged under 12 articles of the Criminal Code for offenses including fraud, bribery and embezzlement. Credible reports indicate that he was subjected to psychological abuse including death threats, sleep deprivation and threats against his relatives, to force him to incriminate himself. In April 2019, a judge ruled that all co-defendants should undergo a medical examination to ascertain whether they had been tortured, but rights groups remain concerned about statements by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office asserting that forensic-medical examinations conducted in the course of investigations had not discovered any evidence of bodily harm. The statements did not provide any further detail. Such a response cannot be regarded as an independent and impartial investigation of the relevant allegations. On June 26, 2019, Kadirov was sentenced to 10 years in prison.<\/p> <p>Death in Custody of Ilhom Ibodov and Ill-Treatment of Rahim Ibodov. Ilhom and Rahim Ibodov, two brothers who used to run a business in Bukhara, were arrested in August 2015 by the State Security Service (SGB) after they refused to pay bribes to officials and threatened to file official complaints about extortion and racketeering. The surviving brother Rahim told relatives that during that time they were severely beaten repeatedly by four other cell mates on the encouragement of law enforcement officials. Two days after their conviction, Rahim Ibodov witnessed his brother being beaten to death by three officers he knew because they had for several years extorted bribes from them. When the family received Ilhom Ibodov\u00b4s body from the authorities, the authorities urged the family to bury it the next day; the death certificate they received indicated a heart attack as cause of death.<\/p> <p>Bobomurod Abdullaev. In May 2018, following a trial observed by journalists and human rights monitors, a court conditionally released but still fined independent journalist Bobomurod Abdullaev who had been detained in September 2017 and then allegedly tortured in pre-trial detention on charges of attempting to overthrow the government. While the trial set a precedent for its degree of openness and transparency, authorities have not investigated Abdullaev\u2019s credible allegations of severe torture. He has also reported being subjected to surveillance by security services on several occasions since the trial and his release.<\/p> <p>The Human Rights Committee should urge the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Provide information on any measures taken to ensure prompt, thorough and impartial investigations are carried out into all deaths in custody as well as all allegations of torture and ill-treatment in all the above-listed cases and others examined by the Committee;<\/p> <p>Inform about measures taken to implement the recommendations of the UN special rapporteur on torture based on his visits to the country in 2002 and the recommendations of the Committee Against Torture in December 2019;<\/p> <p>Publicly acknowledge the scope and gravity of the problem of torture in Uzbekistan and meaningfully investigate all allegations of torture;<\/p> <p>Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT);<\/p> <p>Allow prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), discontinued since 2013.<\/p> <p>Forced or compulsory labour (Article 8)<\/p> <p>Forced labour persists in Uzbekistan\u2019s cotton sector in 2018, despite the government taking measures to enforce a public decree prohibiting the forced mobilization of public sector workers, including teachers, medical personnel. At the time of this submission, no detailed analysis of the 2019 harvest had been published.<\/p> <p>In October 2018, the President dismissed the deputy prime minister Zoyir Mirzayev after an image appeared on social media of local officials and farmers apparently being forced to stand knee-deep in the cold water of an irrigation ditch. Mirzayev was present when an official punished the men for poor harvest results, prompting online anger at their humiliation. An eyewitness told Radio Free Europe\u2019s Uzbek service that the official had \u201cberated the men, saying \u2018if you can't water the wheat, then I'll water you!\u2019 - then forced them into the ditch, where they remained for half an hour for failing to water the wheat fields on time.\u201d At the same time, a social media campaign began where Facebook users posted photographs of themselves standing in irrigation ditches in order to raise awareness of the abuse. Mirzayev was reappointed to a lesser position of the head of a district in the Jizzakh region several weeks later.<\/p> <p>Various authorities continued to mobilize some public sector workers, students and employees of private businesses to pick cotton on threat of punishment or loss of employment. In various regions such as Khorezm, public sector workers were forced to sign forms that they would pick a minimum amount of cotton.<\/p> <p>The International Labour Organization, which found that over 170,000 persons had picked cotton involuntarily during the 2018 harvest, continued to conduct monitoring in the country\u2019s cotton fields.[1] It excluded from its monitoring teams officials from Uzbekistan\u2019s state-aligned Federation of Trade Unions, whose participation in previous monitoring led to concerns that the monitoring may have not been genuinely independent.<\/p> <p>The Human Rights Committee should urge the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Fully abolish the practice of forced labour, and to provide information on the plans and the timeline for the full abolition of any form of forced or compulsory labour in the country\u2019s cotton fields;<\/p> <p>Provide information on how it intends to hold accountable local authorities that mobilize public sector workers and students on threat of punishment, as part of measures to fully abolish the practice of forced labour in cotton fields.<\/p> <p>Right to liberty and continued use of politically motivated imprisonment (Article 9)<\/p> <p>Authorities have released approximately 50 persons imprisoned on politically motivated charges since September 2016, including human rights activists Akzam Turgunov, Mehrinisso and Zulhumor Hamdamova, Isroiljon Kholdorov, Gaybullo Jalilov, Chuyan Mamatkulov, Fahriddin Tillaev, journalists Gayrat Mikhliboev, Yusuf Ruzimuradov, Dilmurod Saidov, and scholar Andrei Kubatin.<\/p> <p>While the releases raised hopes that the Uzbek government was making efforts to reform, authorities did not provide persons released on politically motivated charges with avenues for legal redress, including overturning unlawful convictions, nor access to adequate medical treatment. Rights activists also urged the government to amend its criminal code provisions relating to extremism that are commonly used to criminalize dissent (articles 159, 216, 244-1, and 244-2 of the Criminal Code), and bring them into compliance with Uzbekistan\u2019s international human rights obligations.<\/p> <p>In March 2018, authorities told Human Rights Watch that they had stopped using Article 221 of Uzbekistan\u2019s Criminal Code regarding \u201cviolations of prison rules\u201d to arbitrarily extend the sentences of political prisoners. They have also reportedly released from prison hundreds of \u201cindependent\u201d Muslims\u2014individuals who practice Islam outside strict state controls\u2014but did not provide access to a list of all persons serving sentences on charges of extremism to verify who had been released or not.<\/p> <p>Thousands of individuals imprisoned on politically motivated charges remain behind bars. Among them are Akrom Malikov and Rustam Abdumannapov, scholars; Mirsobir Hamidkariev, a film producer; Aramais Avakyan, a fisherman; Vladimir Kaloshin, a journalist; Ruhiddin Fahriddinov (Fahrutdinov), an independent religious cleric; Ravshan Kosimov, Viktor Shin, and Alisher Achildiev, soldiers; Kadyr Yusupov, a retired diplomat.<\/p> <p>Some cases include:<\/p> <p>Ruhiddin Fahriddinov (also spelled Fahrutdinov in some documents), is an independent religious believer and former cleric. Born in 1967. Kidnapped from southern Kazakhstan on November 24, 2005. Charged with 22 various crimes, among them terrorism, sabotage, organization of illegal religious groups, activity against the constitution, and the dissemination of materials that threaten state security. Sentenced: September 15, 2007; 17 years (but possibly extended for \u201cviolations of prison regime\u201d).<\/p> <p>More information: \u201cUntil the Very End\u201d \u2013 Politically Motivation Imprisonment in Uzbekistan, Human Rights Watch, 2014 (page 67).<\/p> <p>Ravshan Kosimov, is a former soldier, was sentenced unjustly to treason charges in 2008. Kosimov had been a promising young army cadet when he was sent to the United States for a prestigious exchange program. His brief association with the West cost him dearly when he returned to Uzbekistan. He was promptly arrested, tortured, and accused of and sentenced for treason for no other reason than having spent time in the United States. Human Rights Watch has documented torture in Kosimov\u2019s case and has verified claims that his case is politically motivated.<\/p> <p>More information: \u201cBeyond Samarkand: Can Uzbekistan Turn Its Nascent Reform Efforts into a Clear Break with Its Brutal Past?\u201d Los Angeles Review of Books, March 2019.<\/p> <p>The Human Rights Committee should urge the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Release all individuals detained on politically motivated charges, among them Ruhiddin Fahriddinov , former cleric, sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2007, subjected to torture, transferred to lesser strict prison colony in spring 2019; Ravshan Kosimov , a soldier, sentenced in 2008 on politically motivated charges of treason and subjected to torture; Kadyr Yusupov , a retired Uzbek diplomat, sentenced in January 2020 on charges of treason, subjected to psychological torture during his detention commencing in December 2018.<\/p> <p>Provide those recently released with legal rehabilitation, overturn unsound convictions, and ensure access to adequate medical treatment;<\/p> <p>Provide a list of detainees sentenced under the extremism provision of the criminal code and what measures it plans to take to ensure the release of everyone still imprisoned on politically motivated charges<\/p> <p>Provide a detailed timeline on plans to amend the criminal code provisions on extremism to prevent arbitrary and abusive prosecutions, and repeal provisions allowing for arbitrary extension of sentences of political prisoners.<\/p> <p>Right to freedom of expression (Article 19)<\/p> <p>Freedom of speech and of the press have improved under Mirziyoyev but remain restricted. With 56 percent of the population under 30 years old and increasing numbers of mobile internet users, both Uzbek and Russian-language online media are experiencing a period of growth and change. The president has urged the media not to hold back in addressing urgent social issues. Some journalists are now covering sensitive issues such as forced labour and corruption that were previously taboo, helping bring to the fore cases of injustice or wrongdoing by officials.<\/p> <p>Yet much of the media remains under state control, and self-censorship is common. Journalists acknowledged to Human Rights Watch a tendency to self-censor, unclear where the \u201cred lines\u201d are. In May 2019, the government said it was unblocking access to several critical websites that had been blocked for many years, including the websites of Voice of America, Amnesty International, Eurasianet, and Human Rights Watch but access to a lot of the internet remains blocked, including most notably Ozodlik, the Uzbek service of Radio Free Europe and Eltuz.com, an independent media outlet. In June and July 2018, several pioneering local online outlets such as kun.uz, xabar.uz, and qalampir.uz, were unavailable for a period and then came back online. In December 2019, the websites of human rights groups, including The Association for Human Rights in Central Asia, International Partnership for Human Rights, Norwegian Helsinki Committee were also inaccessible for short periods. Facebook and YouTube were blocked for periods in August through November 2018.<\/p> <p>Correspondents from the Voice of America, BBC Uzbek and Eurasianet have received accreditation to report inside Uzbekistan. But Radio Free Europe remained unable to operate in Uzbekistan. In September 2018, authorities detained at least eight conservative bloggers, allegedly for their views advocating a greater role for Islam in Uzbek society. Authorities denied several of them access to lawyers and sentenced some up to 15 days of administrative detention.<\/p> <p>The Human Rights Committee should urge the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Remove all undue restrictions on the right of people in Uzbekistan to freely receive and disseminate information and express critical views, including online;<\/p> <p>Lift all measures directed at shutting down public debate and ensure that any restrictions on free speech can only be imposed by an independent judicial body as provided for in law on a case-by-case basis following an assessment that the speech constitutes a genuine and imminent threat to public or individual safety; any restrictions should be strictly necessary, proportionate, and non-discriminatory;<\/p> <p>Stop blocking access to national and international news and other websites;<\/p> <p>End the blocking of access to all independent websites such as an independent media outlet Eltuz.com, and www.ozodlik.org, the Uzbek service of Radio Free Europe.<\/p> <p>Rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly (Articles 21, 22)<\/p> <p>Authorities have slightly relaxed restrictions on the holding of modest peaceful demonstrations. But several participants in small-scale demonstrations held near the president\u2019s residence or the Prosecutor-General\u2019s office were detained. For example, in July 2018, a group of 30 women were detained outside the president\u2019s residence during a peaceful protest. Six of the 30 were charged with \u201chooliganism\u201d and held for ten days.<\/p> <p>In June 2018, the Justice Ministry announced a new law on NGOs that would relax procedures for registration, including by eliminating the requirement that NGOs receive and hold funds in only two state-approved banks. The NGO law also purported to overturn the June 2015 law that severely restricted NGO activities by requiring organizations to receive advance permission from authorities when holding virtually any activity or meeting. However, even under the amendments registered NGOs are still required to provide advanced notice before holding events or meetings and civil society activists reported that the law has not been effectively implemented. They reported that local Justice Ministry officials have discouraged the registration of new organizations that focus on politically sensitive issues.<\/p> <p>In August 2018, the Justice Ministry registered the American educational exchanges NGO ACCELS\u2014the first American NGO to receive registration in 15 years.<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch renewed its on-the-ground research in Uzbekistan in August 2017, after years of being prevented from operating in the country. While able to freely visit the country and conduct research, Human Rights Watch remained unable to register due to a 2011 Supreme Court decision which remained in effect.<\/p> <p>In June 2019, former Human Rights Watch senior researcher Steve Swerdlow was the target of an aggressive verbal attack by a video blogger and four other people while on a visit to Uzbekistan to investigate human rights abuses. The attack appears to be part of a wider smear campaign against Human Rights Watch, other human rights activists, and journalists in Uzbekistan. Human Rights Watch is very concerned at the signal this incident sends to civil society, including human rights defenders and journalists.<\/p> <p>The Human Rights Committee should urge the government of Uzbekistan to:<\/p> <p>Update the Committee on the registration of independent human rights organisations in the country and the registration of international human rights groups;<\/p> <p>Fully implement the 2018 law on NGOs that relaxes registration and other procedures and eases the registration and accreditation for international NGOs, including Human Rights Watch;<\/p> <p>Protect free speech while also taking steps to protect the right of independent human rights groups to operate in a safe environment, free of intimidation, on-and-offline.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3R5LWXWHR2N13I43ZU1VFXZ618TXGS"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":2099,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state

Continue<\/p> <p>Grave human rights violations have persisted in a context of insecurity in the 15 months since \u00c9variste Ndayishimiye became president of Burundi, Human Rights Watch said. Until Burundian authorities address the root causes of the 2015 crisis and continuing impunity, the United Nations Human Rights Council, meeting in Geneva, should ensure that investigations into the human rights situation in Burundi continue.<\/p> <p>New Human Rights Watch research in Cibitoke found that Burundian intelligence services, security forces, and members of the ruling party's youth league, the Imbonerakure, have allegedly killed, disappeared, and tortured real or perceived political opponents and people suspected of having ties with Burundian rebels in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. People crossing the Rusizi river to travel between Congo and Burundi's Cibitoke province for personal business have been reported missing, and their fate remains unknown.<\/p> <p>\"Residents of Cibitoke described the banks of the Rusizi river as a graveyard where they saw new bodies appear every week or month,\" said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"The combination of rampant corruption, impunity for past abuses, and a crippled judiciary has created the perfect storm for police, national intelligence, and Imbonerakure members to apparently kill, torture, disappear, and steal without consequences.\"<\/p> <p>The UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, established in September 2016 to document grave human rights violations in the country, concluded on September 16, 2021, that \"no structural reform has been undertaken to durably improve the situation. Serious human rights violations have continued to be committed by State officials and members of the Imbonerakure with the acquiescence of authorities or even at their instigation. The rule of law continues to be progressively eroded... \"<\/p> <p>Between June 2020 and September 2021, Human Rights Watch interviewed 33 Burundian victims, witnesses, former and current security or administrative officials, journalists, and civil society activists about killings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detention. Most of the interviews were conducted by phone with sources in Cibitoke province or Bujumbura, the country's largest city.

A former member of parliament and a lawyer and former human rights defender, both convicted of abusive charges, remain in detention. Although Ndayishimiye has pledged to end impunity and corruption, and made some attempts to rein in the Imbonerakure, reports of killings, enforced disappearances, and torture, often of real or perceived political opponents, continue across the country.<\/p> <p>In one case Human Rights Watch documented and reported in the media, Elie Ngomirakiza, a representative of the National Congress for Freedom (Congr\u00e8s national pour la libert\u00e9, CNL), an opposition party, was detained in Ntahangwa commune, in Bujumbura Mairie province, on July 9. Ngomirakiza's whereabouts have not been revealed, although family members have made multiple requests for information and attempts to locate him. In another case, armed men dressed in military clothes took Amauri Kwizera - a driver also known as Babu - from outside his house in Bujumbura on July 16, 2021, and drove him away in a white pickup truck with tinted windows and no number plate, according to two sources present at the time. He has not been located since.<\/p> <p>Cibitoke province has continued to see high rates of human rights violations, according to local monitoring groups. The security situation worsened after attacks by armed groups were reported in Cibitoke and other provinces bordering Congo.<\/p> <p>Since December 2020, Human Rights Watch has documented four cases of apparent torture at an unofficial national intelligence service (Service national de renseignement, SNR) detention facility in Cibitoke town. Former detainees - mainly local farmers - said they were held in small, filthy rooms, were regularly and violently beaten, and questioned about their ties to Congo-based rebels. Some said they heard other detainees being driven off in the middle of the night. One source said he witnessed another detainee's death.<\/p> <p>While the Rusizi river, which forms the border between Burundi and Congo, has historically been a dumping ground for bodies, this past year saw an increase in bodies being found along its banks, local residents said. Several residents of villages along the Rusizi described hearing pickup trucks driving to the river in the middle of the night and seeing blood on its banks the next morning. A former local administrative official said bodies were brought to the river by intelligence agents and thrown in the river.<\/p> <p>In one case Human Rights Watch documented, four sources said that four men in military attire had stopped Emmanuel Baransegeta, 53, from Ruhagarika village, Cibitoke province, as he returned from fishing on the river in the evening on July 8, 2021. A witness saw the men beating him. Two days later, the sources said, a body bearing the same scars as Baransegeta was found nearby along the shores of the Rusizi. They said it was buried without further investigation.<\/p> <p>Since August 2020, many sources, including farmers working along the banks of the Rusizi in Buganda commune also described seeing or receiving photos from local residents of dozens of dead bodies found by the river, sometimes with bullet or knife wounds, bruises, or with their hands tied behind their backs with ropes. In many cases, sources who were there when bodies were discovered said local administrative officials, Imbonerakure members, or police officers buried the bodies without investigating. Alleged abusers have been arrested and prosecuted in only a few cases, in trials that often lacked transparency.<\/p> <p>Since the land border with Congo was closed in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many cross-border traders or farmers have resorted to crossing the river illegally. Several sources, including a former administrative official, said Imbonerakure members managed these border crossings. Eight sources described cases of people who disappeared after trying to cross the river with money or goods, indicating they believed the Imbonerakure members had killed them. Several cases have also been reported by local media and monitoring groups.<\/p> <p>In one case Human Rights watch documented, a 30-year-old farmer who worked in Congo called a friend to say he would be returning to Burundi via the river crossing manned by Imbonerakure members to see his family and that he would pay them to let him cross, because his identity papers had expired. He was never seen again.<\/p> <p>The UN Human Rights Council should ensure that there is continued documentation, monitoring, and public reporting about the situation in Burundi, and hold public debates on the country's human rights situation, with a focus on justice and accountability. It should urge the Burundian authorities to make concrete commitments to carrying out human rights reforms within a clear timeframe, measured against specific benchmarks.<\/p> <p>\"The human rights situation in Burundi remains grave, and the absence of an international investigation would only allow the authorities to hide abuse from sight,\" Mudge said. \"If the Burundian government is serious about reform, it should give external investigators access to the country and work with them to ensure that abusers are held accountable.\"<\/p> <p>For more details about killings, disappearances, and torture in Cibitoke province, please see below.<\/p> <p>Documenting human rights violations in Burundi remains difficult due to restricted access to the country for international human rights organizations, security risks for Burundian activists, and victims' and witnesses' fear of retaliation by the authorities. The cases Human Rights Watch documented are only a fraction of those reported by local media and exiled monitoring groups, which continue to regularly publish accounts of abuses across the country.<\/p> <p>The 'Graveyard Province'<\/p> <p>Since August 2020, Human Rights Watch has received reports about dozens of bodies washing up on the shores of the Rusizi river in Buganda commune of Cibitoke province. Sources in the area, including farmers living and working next to the river, local journalists and human rights defenders, and current and former local administrative officials, said the dead bodies were most likely either people killed while crossing the river to or from Congo, or people taken at night to the river's edge in pickup trucks believed by the sources to belong to the intelligence service and executed or thrown into the river.<\/p> <p>Alleged Torture at a National Intelligence Service Cell in Cibitoke<\/p> <p>Human Rights Watch interviewed four former detainees who were held in an unofficial national intelligence service detention facility located in Cibitoke town, where they said they witnessed abuse and were tortured between September 2020 and August 2021.<\/p> <p>Three of the men were farmers, including two who often traveled to Congo to look for work. They all said they had no political affiliations and had no contact with rebel groups in neighboring Congo. The fourth said he was targeted for his political activities. All said they heard detainees being driven away in the middle of the night. One man who was detained at the national intelligence facility in December 2020 said police officers drunkenly gloated about killing detainees and throwing their bodies into the Rusizi river.<\/p> <p>One man who was detained there in August 2021 said he was tortured and told to confess to working with RED-Tabara (R\u00e9sistance pour un \u00e9tat de droit au Burundi; Resistance for the Rule of Law in Burundi), a Burundian rebel group operating in Congo. He said he was taken to the house by members of the intelligence service and Imbonerakure in a pickup truck. During his week-long detention, he said men in civilian clothing brutally beat him and interrogated him about rebel group operations in the area:<\/p> <p>Former detainees said they were interrogated and beaten by a senior intelligence chief. One former detainee, who was held in December 2020, said:<\/p> <p>Two other sources said they heard screams from the detention facility when they walked past at night.<\/p> <p>One man was arrested in September 2020 and detained there for six weeks. He said police and other men arrested him at his house. He was accused of collaborating with rebels, and said he was taken to a house next to a bank in Cibitoke town:<\/p> <p>He said his family had to pay to have him released, and that his wife had to sell one of his plots of land to pay the bribe.<\/p> <p>Dead Bodies in the Rusizi River<\/p> <p>In many cases, it is impossible to verify the identities of the dead and cause of death, but several local inhabitants sent photos to Human Rights Watch or described bodies showing signs of torture, knife wounds, or bullet wounds, with their arms tied behind their backs, suggesting they had been executed. In many cases, they said the bodies were buried by Imbonerakure members, police officers, or local administrative officials without further investigations.<\/p> <p>In its latest report, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi said: \"Corpses have regularly been found in public areas, including near roads and waterways. The local authorities have continued to bury them without seeking to identify the deceased or to investigate the cause of death and possible perpetrators even though most of the bodies present signs of violent death.\" It concluded that, although it was impossible to differentiate between violations of the right to life perpetrated by state agents and the Imbonerakure and criminal offenses, the authorities were failing in their obligation to protect the rights to life and to an effective remedy \"by refusing to launch credible and impartial investigations into these cases.\"<\/p> <p>In a report published in August, Ndondeza, a Burundian exile group documenting enforced disappearances, shared details of seven apparent cases of enforced disappearances of people attempting to cross the Rusizi, five additional cases reported by family members of people who went missing, and two killings that reportedly took place near the river. When authorities deprive someone of their liberty and refuse to acknowledge the detention, or conceal the person's whereabouts, they are committing an enforced disappearance, a crime under international law and prohibited under all circumstances. A local journalist told Human Rights Watch: \"In Ndava zone of Buganda commune, it's a slaughterhouse. The Imbonerakure are active in the killings, they bring people to the fields at night. The neighbors hear them.\"<\/p> <p>A member of the ruling party, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (Conseil national pour la d\u00e9fense de la d\u00e9mocratie-Forces pour la d\u00e9fense de la d\u00e9mocratie, CNDD-FDD), and former local official said: \"I saw people brought from other provinces. In Burundi, people are killed for not speaking the same language as the government... . Sometimes police brought people from Muyinga province. They brought them in the night and threw them in the river.\"<\/p> <p>Sources who live close to the river reported hearing pickup trucks driving to the river at night. Two sources said that they sometimes saw blood on the riverbanks the next day. In one case Human Rights Watch documented, four sources said that four men in military attire had stopped Emmanuel Baransegeta, 53, from Ruhagarika, Cibitoke province, as he returned from working on the river in the evening on July 8, 2021.<\/p> <p>\"The four military men were asking him: 'Where did you come from? What do you have?'\" one witness said. \"He answered that he didn't have anything, that he'd been fishing. They beat him on the head with the metal butt of their weapons. His voice eventually died down, and when we came out, we saw blood. His body was found nearby in the river.\" Two days later, the sources said, a body bearing the same scars as Baransegeta was found nearby along the shores of the Rusizi. They said it was buried without further investigation.<\/p> <p>A woman who lives near the Rusizi river in Buganda commune said in November 2020: \"In August, I saw two bodies floating down the river. They had been pierced by branches, they were tied up and naked. One branch connected two bodies. We collected them and buried them. Also in August I saw another body floating down, it had a rope tied around its neck... . My father says that he often sees bodies floating down on the Burundian side of the river.\"<\/p> <p>A man from Ruhagarika, in Buganda commune, said in November 2020 that he saw many bodies floating down the river: \"On November 1 or 2, there was a man whose genitals had been cut off. The local authorities just gave the order to bury him immediately... we could see from the marks on his body that he had been beaten.\" Other sources from Ruhagarika also reported seeing bodies float down the river regularly.<\/p> <p>Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Human Rights NGO Burundi By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

During the meeting, several government officials expressed concern over the dead bodies appearing on the shores of the river. A recording of the meeting shared with Human Rights Watch included the prosecutor of Cibitoke province telling the police to allow investigations on bodies that are found to avoid having \"people blame the police or other authorities.\"<\/p> <p>In the recording, the governor of Cibitoke also said that local administrators should report the bodies to the judiciary to avoid having detractors criticize Burundi. He said the bodies could be people killed in Congo, but that because photos were shared on WhatsApp groups, people assumed they had been killed in Cibitoke province. He said that officials should stop sharing rumors and inform the authorities when bodies were found. Provincial officials reported that bodies had been found along the river, and also said that some of the people had drowned while attempting to swim across the river.<\/p> <p>On August 24, 2021, Ndayishimiye gave a speech to magistrates calling for an end to corruption in the judiciary in order to promote development and investment and to end violent score-settling: \"No development is possible in a country without justice. There cannot be peace or development.\" Yet, as a judge pointed out to Ndayishimiye during the meeting, another fundamental challenge the judiciary faces remains the influence of the executive and the implication of state actors in serious human rights violations.<\/p> <p>Alleged Killings by Imbonerakure Members<\/p> <p>Land border crossings between Burundi and Congo were closed in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and several inhabitants interviewed said that Imbonerakure members often manage illegal border crossings on the river at night. One land border crossing at Gatumba, next to Bujumbura, reopened in June 2021, but many people continue to illegally cross the river between the two countries to avoid paying fees for mandatory Covid-19 tests, to avoid traveling to Gatumba, or because their identity papers are out of date. Sources in the area said that, before the pandemic, people could cross the river by boat at official border posts.<\/p> <p>One source said that his brother, a 30-year-old farmer who worked in Congo, had died while crossing the river in July 2021. The source said his brother had called him to say he would be returning via the river crossing manned by Imbonerakure members, who would charge him 200,000 Burundian Francs (approximately US$100), because his identity papers had expired. He said he would bring back all of his savings, but he was never seen again. The source said: \"He had gone to [Congo] for work; he was a farmer and he sent money back home. He wanted to see his family, and since coronavirus he could no longer cross the border.\"<\/p> <p>Three other sources said Imbonerakure members robbed people attempting to cross the river and drowned them. The member of the CNDD-FDD party and former local official said: \"I saw the evildoing of the Imbonerakure who went to Congo. They would help people cross the river, but they drown them and steal their things.\" He said he was often informed by family members who had lost a loved one trying to cross the river.<\/p> <p>In one case in which Imbonerakure members reportedly killed a young boy after they stole his goats, two of the attackers were tried and given life sentences. However, the authorities have not made sufficient efforts to transparently investigate the killings and ensure justice in the majority of cases, Human Rights Watch said.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3LXX8KJXPYOZUZ33KX8P43MQLR49OJ"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1141,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","killing","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"June","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cibitoke","country":"Burundi","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Elie Ngomirakiza","victim_keywords":"National Congress for Freedom, disappeared, whereabouts unknown","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Amauri Kwizera a.k.a Babu","victim_keywords":"driver, forced disappearance, whereabouts unknown","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Emmanuel Baransegeta","victim_keywords":"forcibly disappeared, beaten, suspected deceased","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"farmers, fishermen, civilians, citizens, Rusizi river, forced disappearance, torture, murder","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["enforced disappearance","killing","torture"],"year":"2020","month":"June","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cibitoke","country":"Burundi","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Elie Ngomirakiza","victim_keywords":"National Congress for Freedom, disappeared, whereabouts unknown","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Amauri Kwizera a.k.a Babu","victim_keywords":"driver, forced disappearance, whereabouts unknown","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Emmanuel Baransegeta","victim_keywords":"forcibly disappeared, beaten, suspected deceased","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"farmers, fishermen, civilians, citizens, Rusizi river, forced disappearance, torture, murder","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":941660108,"Input.title":"Mali president Keita vowed to end coups.

He is medically unfit; he suffers from a hormonal defect. He is racist and a fascist; a murderer and a blasphemer; a tribalist and a dictator. Gen Amin has no principles, no moral standards and scruples. He will kill, or cause to kill, anyone without hesitation as long as it serves his interests, such as prolonging his stay in power, or getting what he wants such as a woman or money.<\/p> <p>He is an incorrigible liar, both locally and internationally; his word in international dealings should never be relied on. He possesses no moral or political standards. He sets his own \u2018standards\u2019, writes his own \u2018rules\u2019 and changes them as he moves along. It therefore becomes very difficult for anyone to predict his moves. If we take that level of illiteracy for a President of a modern state, the problem takes on fantastic dimensions. For instance, Amin finds it well-nigh impossible to sit in an office for a day. He cannot concentrate on any serious topic for half a morning. He does not read. He cannot write. The sum total of these disabilities makes it impossible for him either to sit in the regular cabinet, to follow up cabinet minutes, or to comprehend the briefs written to him by his ministers.<\/p> <p>In short, he is out of touch with the daily running of the country, not because he likes it but because of illiteracy.<\/p> <p>He rarely attends the cabinet, and even then it is only when he is giving directives about the problems concerning defence or \u201csecurity\u201d of the country, or when he is sacking some civil servant. So the only means of getting the information about the country which he rules is by ear from various sources. In other words, he relies solely on listening and perhaps seeing.<\/p> <p>Since most of his ministers are what one might term technocrats, he finds them too complicated and uninteresting, although they are the people who should actually give him correct information. Instead, he has to have recourse to people of his own level of intelligence and calibre. In effect, these are the people who rule the country: the illiterate and semi-literate army officers who have recently been drafted into the service. Practically, all of them get their information by word of mouth and get directives from their superiors verbally. Since little is ever written down, and once said, there is little or no follow-up to change the plan or check the facts. This type of government can lead to disastrous result, especially where security is concerned.<\/p> <p>Illiteracy led to overloading of Amin\u2019s memory. In one instance, he deported three expatriate doctors he had been told were British spies, bombastically accusing them of spreading \u201cpolitical gonorrhoea\u201d. Two of them were members of his medical team. We are presented with a picture of a man who cannot fathom the complex problems of modern society...he oversimplifies the problems as well as their solutions, to the detriment of the entire nation\u2019s future. He thinks governing a country means talking to and entertaining big crowds of people.<\/p> <p>He does not possess slightest rudiments about economics. For instance, he was urging his Finance Minister to print more paper money if there was not enough money in government coffers. The country is bankrupt. A lot of the money is spent on spying, the army and his personal projects. He has literally millions of shillings, in USA dollars which he keeps at his house in case of troubles. He has deposited millions in Libya, to which he will retire in the event of trouble. In fact he has bought three big villas in Tripoli for his personal use.<\/p> <p>His abysmal ignorance has made him hate education, educated people and educational institutions. He brags that if he could rule the country well, then there is no need for highly educated people. Amin fired an experienced, fully qualified public servant from the job of permanent secretary to the President\u2019s Office replacing him with an Assistant District Commissioner educated only to school certificate level. Chairmanship of the Public Service Commission went to the Town Clerk of a small town in Karamoja region, Moroto. Both the new appointees came from Amin\u2019s West Nile home region.<\/p> <p>On my first trip with him to Libya, Amin assured Col. Gadaffi that 80 per cent of Uganda\u2019s population was Muslim and that this majority had for long been dominated by Christian or heathen minority. In truth- Muslim- mainly the Nubians only accounted for not more than 10 per cent of the population. Both Libya and Saudi Arabia donated money from the Jihad (Holy War) Fund to be used to eliminate the few remaining Christians and turn Uganda into a Muslim country.<\/p> <p>Amin\u2019s first victims had been Catholic; Chief Justice (Benedicto) Kiwanuka was a catholic, Father Kiggundu, the editor of the Catholic newspaper Munno had been abducted and burnt to death. Munno reported a Women\u2019s Council resolution calling for the investigation into \u2018disappearances\u2019. Amin went on to liquidate many of the important Catholics in the civil service and business world... many Catholic prison officers, administrative secretaries and others. He went further to attack nuns and priests in the press for allegedly acting as spies. He also turned against Protestants. Among the leading protestant killed: Michael Kaggwa. Amin was also known to be interested in Kaggwa\u2019s girlfriend (Hallen Ogwang).<\/p> <p>Methods of killing<\/p> <p>The former minister further notes in his letter: \u201cThe methods of killing used during the first months of the coup included straight-forward shooting or beating; with disposal of dead bodies becoming a problem, the soldiers resorted to throwing bodies of their victims either in rivers, swamps or even water reservoirs. This was found to be unsatisfactory, as human bodies tend to float and to attract vultures. Later, they were simply thrown into the bush and left there to rot or eaten by wild beasts, or were burnt by petrol fires.<\/p> <p>Amin\u2019s principal killers were to devise harrowing tortures. The victims would line up and the first one would be ordered to lie down while the prisoner next to him was then ordered to smash his head with a huge hammer. The trend would go on until the last man who would either be shot by Towelli himself or be killed in the same brutal manner by a police officer. The victims\u2019 heads would be smashed beyond recognition by one of the appointed executioners.<\/p> <p>Slow killing is a common practice. Towelli would shoot into a man\u2019s arm, leg or chest and let him bleed to death.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3I4E7AFQ2ME4D3LK2QL1N76GG74JTN"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1024,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"1973","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Uganda","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Benedicto Kiwanuka","victim_keywords":"chief justice, catholic, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Father Kiggundu","victim_keywords":"editor, catholic newspaper, Munno, tortured, burned, murdered","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Michael Kaggwa","victim_keywords":"protestant, leader, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Christians, Uganda, religious purge","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing","other","torture"],"year":"1973","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Uganda","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Benedicto Kiwanuka","victim_keywords":"chief justice, catholic, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Father Kiggundu","victim_keywords":"editor, catholic newspaper, Munno, tortured, burned, murdered","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Michael Kaggwa","victim_keywords":"protestant, leader, killed","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Christians, Uganda, religious purge","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":908067592,"Input.title":"Journalists Speak Up for Julian Assange","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-24 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>See: 1242 Signatures from 99 Countries as of 21 Feb 10:30 a.m. GMT<\/p> <p>[TMS editor is #700 on the list]<\/p> <p>Julian Assange, founder and publisher of WikiLeaks, is currently detained in Belmarsh high-security prison in the United Kingdom and faces extradition to the United States and criminal prosecution under the Espionage Act.<\/p> <p>He risks up to 175 years imprisonment for his part in making public the leak of US military documents from Afghanistan and Iraq, and a trove of US State Department cables.<\/p> <p>The \u2018War Diaries\u2019 provided evidence that the US Government misled the public about activities in Afghanistan and Iraq and committed war crimes. WikiLeaks partnered with a wide range of media organizations worldwide that republished the War Diaries and embassy cables.<\/p> <p>The legal action underway against Mr Assange sets an extremely dangerous precedent for journalists, media organizations and the freedom of the press.<\/p> <p>We, journalists and journalistic organizations around the globe, express our grave concern for Mr Assange\u2019s wellbeing, for his continued detention and for the draconian espionage charges.<\/p> <p>This case stands at the heart of the principle of free speech. If the US government can prosecute Mr Assange for publishing classified documents, it may clear the way for governments to prosecute journalists anywhere, an alarming precedent for freedom of the press worldwide. Also, the use of espionage charges against people publishing materials provided by whistleblowers is a first and should alarm every journalist and publisher.<\/p> <p>In a democracy, journalists can reveal war crimes and cases of torture and abuse without having to go to jail. It is the very role of the press in a democracy. If governments can use espionage laws against journalists and publishers, they are deprived of their most important and traditional defense \u2013 of acting in the public interest \u2013 which does not apply under the Espionage Act.<\/p> <p>Prior to being moved to Belmarsh prison, Mr Assange spent more than a year under house arrest and then seven years inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had been granted political asylum. Throughout this time he was subjected to serious violations of his human rights, including having his legally privileged conversations spied on by organizations taking direct instruction from US agencies. Journalists visiting were subjected to pervasive surveillance. He had restricted access to legal defense and medical care and was deprived of exposure to sunlight and exercise.<\/p> <p>In April 2019, the Moreno government allowed UK law enforcement officers to enter the Ecuador embassy and seize Mr Assange. Since then he has been held in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day and, according to visitors, is \u201cheavily medicated\u201d. His physical and mental health have seriously deteriorated.<\/p> <p>As early as 2015 the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) determinedthat Mr Assange was arbitrarily detained and deprived of his liberty, and called for him to be released and paid compensation. In May 2019, the WGAD reiterated its concerns and request for his personal liberty to be restored.<\/p> <p>We hold the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Ecuador and Sweden accountable for the human rights violations to which Mr Assange has been subjected.<\/p> <p>Julian Assange has made an outstanding contribution to public interest journalism, transparency and government accountability around the world. He is being singled out and prosecuted for publishing information that should never have been withheld from the public. His work has been recognized by the Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in 2011, the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, the Index on Censorship prize, the Economist\u2019s New Media Award, the Amnesty International New Media Award, the 2019 Gavin MacFadyen Award and many others. WikiLeaks has also been nominated for the UN Mandela Prize in 2015 and for the Nobel Peace Prize seven times (2010-2015, 2019).<\/p> <p>Mr Assange\u2019s reporting of abuses and crimes is of historic importance, as have been the contributions by whistleblowers Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner, who are now in exile or incarcerated. They have all faced relentless smear campaigns waged by their opponents, campaigns that have often led to erroneous media reports and a lack of scrutiny and media coverage of their predicaments.<\/p> <p>The systematic abuse of Mr Assange\u2019s rights for the past nine years has been understood and protested by the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists and leading human rights organisations. But in public discussion there has been an insidious normalising of how he has been treated.<\/p> <p>United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer investigated the case and in June 2019 wrote:<\/p> <p>\u201cit finally dawned on me that I had been blinded by propaganda, and that Assange had been systematically slandered to divert attention from the crimes he exposed. Once he had been dehumanized through isolation, ridicule and shame, just like the witches we used to burn at the stake, it was easy to deprive him of his most fundamental rights without provoking public outrage worldwide. And thus, a legal precedent is being set, through the backdoor of our own complacency, which in the future can and will be applied just as well to disclosures by The Guardian, the New York Times and ABC News\u201d. \u201cBy displaying an attitude of complacency at best, and of complicity at worst, Sweden, Ecuador, UK and US governments have created an atmosphere of impunity encouraging Mr Assange\u2019s uninhibited vilification and abuse. In 20 years of work with victims of war, violence and political persecution I have never seen a group of democratic States ganging up to deliberately isolate, demonize and abuse a single individual for such a long time and with so little regard for human dignity and the rule of law.\u201d<\/p> <p>In November 2019, Melzer recommended that Mr Assange\u2019s extradition to US be barred and that he be promptly released. \u201cHe continues to be detained under oppressive conditions of isolation and surveillance, not justified by his detention status (\u2026) Mr Assange\u2019s continued exposure to arbitrariness and abuse may soon end up costing his life\u201d, said Melzer.<\/p> <p>In 1898, French writer \u00c9mile Zola wrote the open letter J\u2019accuse\u2026! (I accuse) to warn about the wrongful sentencing to life in prison of a military officer named Alfred Dreyfus on espionage charges. Zola\u2019s stance entered history books and still today stands for our duty to fight miscarriages of justice and to hold the powerful to account.<\/p> <p>This duty is as necessary as ever today, when Julian Assange is being victimized by governments and faces 17 charges[1] under the US Espionage Act, legislation that also dates back over hundred years.<\/p> <p>As journalists and journalists\u2019 organizations that believe in human rights, freedom of information and of the public\u2019s right to know, we demand the immediate release of Julian Assange.<\/p> <p>We urge our governments, all national and international agencies and fellow journalists to call for an end to the legal campaign being waged against him for the crime of revealing war crimes.<\/p> <p>We urge our fellow journalists to inform the public accurately about this abuse of fundamental rights.<\/p> <p>We urge all journalists to speak up in defense of Julian Assange at this critical time.<\/p> <p>Dangerous times call for fearless journalism.<\/p> <p>NOTE:<\/p> <p>[1] There is a further charge under different legislation, making a total of 18 charges.<\/p> <p>(Only journalists, organizations and people in journalism-related roles \u2013 columnists\/commentators, editors, photographers, cameramen and camerawomen, media producers and publishers, documentary filmmakers, whistleblowers, journalism professors\/trainers or academics researching journalism and media, representatives of journalism organizations including journalists\u2019 trade unions, and NGOs which defend press freedom, and work in defence of whistleblowers, digital rights and transparency and similar roles \u2013 are eligible to sign.)<\/p> <p>*This article has been posted here from TRANSCEND Media Service (TMS)<\/p> <p>Share Share<\/p> <p>Tumblr<\/p> <p>Twitter<\/p> <p>Reddit<\/p> <p>Print<\/p> <p>LinkedIn<\/p> <p>Email<\/p> <p>Facebook<\/p> <p>Pinterest<\/p> <p>Pocket<\/p> <p>Like this: Like Loading...

According to his family in England he has \u201cmental health issues.\u201d He was \u201csaid to have\u201d weapons and explosives. He was \u201csaid to have\u201d threatened the four hostages but everyone seems to agree no one was harmed. He wanted Siddiqui free from the near-by maximum security Carswell Prison; he wanted to speak to her. Under heavy criticism the FBI has said that his hostage-taking had nothing to do with their being Jews, \u201cnot his issue.\u201d But to the press, Siddiqui \u201chas a history of anti-semitism,\u201d hence the universal media criticism. To the police, FBI, government, killing Akram represented a successful outcome to the crisis. Siddiqui\u2019s lawyer and family distanced themselves from Akram\u2019s actions, but to say they remain completely frustrated by their thwarted attempts to free a very ill, frail, and innocent Aafia Siddiqui, after repeated pleas to the US government and unfulfilled promises by the Pakistani government, would be to vastly understate the case.<\/p> <p>Pakistani-born Boston graduate student Aafia Siddiqui\u2019s crime was to be caught in America\u2019s post 9\/11 anti-Muslim hysteria. She had come to America in 1990 to study, earning a biology degree and then a Ph.D in neuroscience from MIT. Her colleagues called her quiet and religious (but not a fundamentalist). Her marriage to Mohammed Amjad Khan ended in divorce when he proved to be violent and more fundamentalist than Siddiqui. She was mistakenly accused of anti-American Muslim activism initially (partially because of mistaken identity), but the accusations ballooned. In the early War On Terror days, \u201cassociations\u201d became much more significant and damning. Siddiqui ended up on Attorney General John Ashcroft\u2019s \u201cWatchlist.\u201d As the Big Lies of government grew, soon the New York Post was calling her \u201cLady Al Queda.\u201d<\/p> <p>Once the government labeled her a \u201cterrorist,\u201d she had no chance of escaping the Empire\u2019s punishment. When her true story began to emerge, it was necessary to take action. While visiting in Pakistan, helped by Pakistani American operatives, she was \u201cdisappeared.\u201d Her youngest child was killed when she was taken, and her other two children imprisoned separately for years. She was beaten, raped, tortured and kept in solitary in black site prisons of the American Empire, particularly in Afghanistan. Other prisoners have testified that they saw her at Bagram, a prison from which the Obama administration prevented prisoners\u2019 court appearances because they might talk about the conditions of their imprisonment. Eventually Aafia Siddiqui would be set up for final punishment and disposal.<\/p> <p>From my book Women Politicals in America:<\/p> <p>At the trial\u2014in January 2010\u2014the soldiers said that Aafia Siddiqui, accused would-be assassin and presumed Al Qaeda terrorist, did, in fact, get hold of an unsecured M-4 automatic rifle and open fire on US soldiers and FBI agents in Ghazni, Afghanistan. The day before, she had been picked up by local policemen as a \u201cpossible suicide bomber\u201d because she had been \u201cloitering\u201d in a public square with a young boy [whose identity is not clear]. She carried instructions to create biological weapons, descriptions of US \u201cmilitary assets,\u201d numerous jars containing \u201cchemical substances,\u201d and documents containing words like \u201cEmpire State Building\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn Bridge.\u201d The soldiers said that the day after her discovery and arrest, an American army captain, a warrant officer, two army interpreters and two FBI agents came to question Siddiqui at Ghazni police headquarters. The soldiers said that none of those men were \u201caware that Siddiqui was being held, unsecured, behind [a] curtain.\u201d Oddly, no one looked behind it. And also oddly, the American warrant officer placed his M-4 rifle next to the curtain. What happened next, said the soldiers, was that Siddiqui pulled the rifle to her, unlatched the safety, pointed the gun at the captain, and while one of the interpreters grabbed for the gun, Siddiqui fired the gun twice. The soldiers agreed she had said, \u201cGet the fuck out of here!\u201d She hit no one. The soldiers said the interpreter knocked her to the ground and the warrant officer fired \u201capproximately two rounds\u201d into Siddiqui\u2019s stomach. She collapsed, unconscious. FBI special Agent Eric Negron testified at her trial that he saw the rifle raised (although he could not see her face behind the curtain). Negron said that after she was shot he helped restrain the struggling Siddiqui. \u201cI had to strike her several times with a closed fist across the face.\u201d Finally she \u201ceither fainted or faked that she had fainted\u201d and was handcuffed. The soldiers had successfully restrained the suspected terrorist Siddiqui. Although her prints were not on the rifle, the holes in the police station wall put there by the rifle Siddiqui allegedly fired were proved to have been there before the July 2008 incident, and since, if she had tried to kill the soldiers, she missed and was herself grievously shot in the abdomen, her sentence seemed disproportionate. Aafia Siddiqui was given 86 years in prison. She had been labeled a terrorist enemy of the Empire and its soldiers, and her case was disposed of accordingly.<\/p> <p>Siddiqui had been extradited for the offense of attempting to kill soldiers, but she was tried, completely illegally, as a notorious female terrorist. She was not allowed to speak of her torture or the killing of her baby. The trial\u2014then as now\u2014of a \u201cterrorist, as with Julian Assange, allows for only the government\/prosecutorial side. The defendant cannot win. Siddiqui was also in very bad shape, physically and mentally during her trial, with a badly dressed stomach wound that the judge had to intervene to have treated. She was forced to undergo strip searches every day and was forced to testify. When she mentioned being in a secret prison, with her children tortured in front of her, the testimony was stricken from the record. She also, and this is arguably something the hostage-taker Malik Faisad Akram was aware of, did not want \u201cZionists\u201d chosen as jurors and said her guilty verdict came from Israel, not America. Some said she was irrational which was entirely possible, but with the anti-Muslim elements of her trial, perhaps not so irrational.<\/p> <p>She has been in prison since 2010 and has, according to her family, suffered unjust punishments within the prison, and her medical problems are not treated. For much of the last 11 years, she has also not been able to communicate with her family. According to the Free Aafia website, maintained by her family and friends, she was attacked last July and suffered serious injuries.

And based on how I was treated, the state considered me a political prisoner also.<\/p> <p>After my capture, I was beaten and tortured for the next six to seven hours.

A penitentiary like ADX or Marion is very dehumanizing.<\/p> <p>What the United States government wanted most was to make us pay for a movement that was creating a lot of problems for them. We were condemned to as many years as they could sentence us to. But all of us made a commitment to the independence of Puerto Rico.<\/p> <p>We were willing to go to prison for Puerto Rico and for the decolonization of Puerto Rico. And for the decolonization of other places, because we never focused only on Puerto Rico.<\/p> <p>Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera is part of the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation. For his work fighting for Puerto Rican decolonization, he was caged for 36 years.<\/p> <p>For us, the injustices that the United States government was doing were painful. When the United States government thought that they really had us, we were strong and we were able to face the challenges that they imposed on us. Puerto Rico\u2019s independence is absolutely necessary.<\/p> <p>Colonialism is that tool the United States government has used effectively to take our most fundamental rights as human beings, and that\u2019s the right to self-determination. I am profoundly grateful for what Puerto Ricans did for us.<\/p> <p>After 36 years of imprisonment, I came home feeling stronger than the day that I entered the first penitentiary, and the time I spent in those penitentiaries was always awful. But little by little, I was able to transcend all the punishments that they threw at me.<\/p> <p>And I walked out of the United States and into Puerto Rico. And for the independence of Puerto Rico, I have not given up.<\/p> <p>Saleem Holbrook, executive director, Abolitionist Law Center<\/p> <p>It\u2019s clear cut when you have a system that was founded on exploitation, that was founded on genocide, and its legacy continues today, there\u2019s no alternative but abolition. We have tried for centuries to reform this system.<\/p> <p>In 2020, we all witnessed national uprisings against police violence, against police murder, against extrajudicial murder in this country. However, that uprising was nothing new. We saw it in the 1960s. We saw it in 1980 in Liberty City. We saw it in 1992 in Los Angeles. We could go back to the riots of 1919, and we could go back further. This is an epidemic in this country that we have been dealing with for generations.<\/p> <p>Saleem Holbrook is executive director of the Abolitionist Law Center, a law firm founded to abolish racist and classist mass incarceration in the US.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s unfortunate that I still had to experience this when political prisoners and movements 30, 40 and 50 years ago were fighting against this system and the abuses that it brings upon us.<\/p> <p>The common failure that I see is that when you look at all of the after-action reports, when you look at all the government reports, all of the city reports, all of them trot out the same tired reforms that were trotted out the last time there was an uprising, the last time there was a riot, the last time we felt the need to have to take to the streets and set something on fire.<\/p> <p>You have to come to the realization that this tactic has failed. And now we have to push further for abolition, because you can\u2019t reform it.<\/p> <p>Jalil Muntaqim, member, Black Liberation Army and Black Panther Party: Incarcerated for 49 years<\/p> <p>COINTELPRO was an operation by the federal government, by the FBI, to destroy any progressive, revolutionary or national militant organization during the \u201950s, \u201960s and the \u201970s. COINTELPRO operated to create dissension to infiltrate and to destroy a movement \u2013 to use every resource available to them to destroy the Black Panther Party. And by virtue of that, we fought back.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s very important to understand that our relationship to the state is political. Although they criminalize our politics, they convict us in the court of the criminal courts of law; and therefore, they try to deny the existence of political prisoners. I just want to make this point clear.<\/p> <p>Jalil Muntaqim, a Black Liberation Army and Black Panther Party member and recently released Political Prisoner, was wrongfully incarcerated for 49 years until 2021. In 1977, he started the first petition to the UN to acknowledge the existence of political prisoners. He conceived of the tribunal, just held in October, while still in prison in 2018.<\/p> <p>Back in 1977, I initiated the first petition to the United Nations to acknowledge the existence of political prisoners and, in the course of that, the conditions of prison itself. They denied the existence of political prisoners in the United States, the only industrial nation in the world that I\u2019m aware of who denies the existence of political prisoners.<\/p> <p>Because we are political, the state tries to suppress our capacity to teach. I was sent to solitary confinement for four months for my teaching classes. I was teaching the history of resistance.<\/p> <p>One of the things that they did not want us to do is teach prisoners, to raise their consciousness, to remove their relationship with a criminal mentality, to move them towards a revolutionary mentality.

Why people supported Tsikhanouskaya, and what she herself thinks of the prospect of becoming president - in the material of the MBH Media.<\/p> <p>Love and politics<\/p> <p>\u201cInitially, I submitted those docs for the sake of love, and then the struggle for the people of Belarus began,\u201d says Tsikhanouskaya.<\/p> <p>Sviatlana is 37 years old, she is a translator from Mikashevichy - a small town in the Brest region. In the recent years, she has been a housewife. A short brunette with a tired face, but glowing eyes, she gives me mixed feelings. With such a woman, we could run into on the street and mutually apologize, smiling. And now she is a candidate for the presidency of an entire state.<\/p> <p>Tsikhanouskaya has no political program. She calls for one thing - a fair election. The election, before which political prisoners will be released and given the right to become candidates. And all people will be given the right to vote without falsification.<\/p> <p>Sviatlana does not consider herself a politician. She believes that fate just decided so.<\/p> <p>\u201cA politician is a person who communicates on political topics with other politicians and strives for power. And I don't need power as such. If we define a politician as a person who wants to make their country better, then I probably fit this concept. But I don't feel like a politician,\u201d Tsikhanouskaya tells me.<\/p> <p>Although Tsikhanouskaya admits that she is not interested in working in politics, she sees positive aspects in the whole thing.<\/p> <p>\u201cI like the fact that I met a lot of people, cool, smart, who formed my headquarters. I like that people felt like people, they felt that they are a nation, they found the strength to overcome those fears that have been ripening for over 20 years. And I like that I became a part of this, became a symbol of some kind of change\u201d.<\/p> <p>The People<\/p> <p>As part of the election campaign, Sviatlana travels around the cities of Belarus, gathering coordinated rallies. And, even in the smallest towns, hundreds, if not thousands, of people come to support her.<\/p> <p>For example, in Brest, with a population of 300 thousand people, 20 thousand were at the rally in support of Sviatlana. She herself was late for the rally - first, her car had a punctured tyre, then she was stopped by traffic police officers twice, allegedly to check the condition of the car. She arrived with Veranika Tsapkala, the wife of the withdrawn candidate Valer Tsapkala, and Maryja Kalesnikava, head of the headquarters of Viktar Babaryka, against whom a criminal case was opened. The ladies decided to work together and create a joint headquarters.<\/p> <p>When they took the stage in Brest, all 20 thousand people applauded them. The rally took place practically in the forest, so many could not even see the stage, but they still applauded. Sviatlana was given flowers, she smiled and shook hands with people. Veranika and Maryja held small children in their arms.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen I go to a picket, and people are very warmly chanting \u201cSveta! Sveta!\u201d, I felt that ... You know, people have been wanting to get to this place for years, they are engaged in some kind of politics. And I ended up in this place by the will of fate. I don\u2019t think I did a lot to get people to perceive me that way. But people probably have a different opinion on this matter. Maybe this is underestimating myself,\u201d says Sviatlana.<\/p> <p>\u201cI think that people see in me the same person as they are themselves,\u201d says Tsikhanouskaya. \u201cThey do not see a politician who is striving for power. They see a person who has taken responsibility. I am ordinary, I am simple, I do not want the power to rule the country. I do not know how to rule over people, I am too soft for that. Even now, my team sometimes has to protect me in some ways. The main thing for me is that there is peace in all senses, but this does not happen. Therefore, it would be difficult for me to make any decisions, because I want everything to be just fine.\u201d<\/p> <p>Tsikhanouskaya's opinion about her role in the country's modern politics is confirmed by the people who come to her rallies. Belarusians really saw a symbol of change in Sviatlana.<\/p> <p>\u201cNow it is impossible to hide the truth, and we have a hope that everything will work out,\u201d Ala, a participant in the rally in support of Tsikhanouskaya in Brest, tells me. \u201cAnd Tsikhanouskaya offers changes. She is like a breath of air in this system of ours. We want justice, we want our children not to leave the country.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ala said that she herself lives on a \u201cbeggarly pension\u201d, and her children have left Belarus.<\/p> <p>\u201cLukashenka is stuck in some kind of Soviet youth. I am a Soviet child too, but I look at young people - there are no decent salaries, there is nowhere for people to work, that \u201cparasitic\u201d stuff (the decree on social parasitism, signed by Lukashenka - MBH Media), these tortures, this is totally outrageous!\u201d Ala thinks.<\/p> <p>\u201cChange will not come overnight. It will be a long and difficult journey. The most important thing that should happen in people's self-consciousness is that there will be no dictatorship, that no one will shut their mouths, everyone will be free to express themselves,\u201d Sviatlana explains to me.<\/p> <p>So, what is next?<\/p> <p>Many who came to the rally in Brest say that fair election cannot be expected. \u201cWe would very much like, we very much hope, but you yourself know ...\u201d this is what Belarusians who gathered to support Sviatlana say. However, if necessary, they are ready to take to the street again. Tsikhanouskaya herself is ready.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are for the legal protection of our votes. Each person is their own leader. Tsikhanouskaya is not a leader. Taking to the street is legal, this is our right, according to the Constitution. But if all our ways in which we will prove that the elections were rigged do not work, and once again they spit in our face with \u201cyour votes mean nothing\u201d, then people will understand that there is no other choice but to go on strike and take to the streets. If people decide to protest, I will be with them. I will not be ahead, but I will be among them. But I will not lead. And I will not call for this. If people decide that it should be so, then, of course, I will be among them.\u201d<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3XH7ZM9YX492RCVJCPPTYYRVWEO9RS"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"2303b84d-0115-4284-b9df-e5c53f359001","work_time_in_seconds":371,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Siarhei Tsikhanouski","victim_keywords":"blogger, prison, trumped-up charges","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":false,"perpetrator_type":null,"violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Siarhei Tsikhanouski","victim_keywords":"blogger, prison, trumped-up charges","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":885746900,"Input.title":"Class War Violence: Centralia 1919","Input.publish_date":"2019-11-11 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>by<\/p> <p>November 11, 2019, will mark the 100-year anniversary of the Armistice Day Tragedy in Centralia, Washington, a horrible event in Pacific Northwest history. On Armistice Day, 1919, a mob of American Legionaires raided the Centralia Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) hall and later lynched Wesley Everest, an IWW logger. Many Pacific Northwest residents remain engaged in debates about the facts of the incident. Unfortunately, it\u2019s common to hear calls for \u201cbalance\u201d in discussions of the tragedy. Balance? Balance between the perspectives of the vigilante lynch mob and the working-class radicals fighting to form a union? Balance between the wealthy men who raided union halls and lynched Wesley Everest, and those who struggled to improve their worklives? Those who support the employer, vigilante, and American Legion perspective are in luck. In downtown Centralia, they have a monument to the bosses who terrorized working-class radicals throughout the Pacific Northwest. Walking through downtown Centralia today, it\u2019s difficult to miss the massive \u201cSentinel\u201d statue, a tribute to the American Legion vigilantes who died while attacking the IWW hall. Rejecting the false \u201cbalance\u201d between working-class activist and employing-class vigilante, Brian Barnes and Roger Snider joined me in penning The Red Coast: Radicalism and Anti-Radicalism in Southwest Washington, published earlier this year by Oregon State University Press. We aimed to provide a working-class perspective on many of the labor struggles of the early twentieth century Pacific Northwest, including the Armistice Day Tragedy in Centralia. What follows is a chapter from the book entitled \u201cClass War: Centralia 1919.\u201d Excerpt from The Red Coast: Radicalism and Anti-Radicalism in Southwest Washington by Aaron Goings, Brian Barnes, and Roger Snider, copyright  2019. Available from booksellers or from Oregon State University Press, 1-800-621-2736. \u201cAround Centralia are wooded hills; men have been beaten beneath these trees and lynched from them. The beautiful Chehalis River flows near by; Wesley Everest was left dangling from one of its bridges. But Centralia is provokingly pretty for all that. It is small wonder that lumber trust henchmen wish to keep it all for themselves.\u201d \u2013 Ralph Chaplin, The Centralia Conspiracy<\/p> <p>The Centralia American Legion and the leading businessmen of that city had more than a parade in mind when they gathered on November 11, 1919, to celebrate Armistice Day. Apparently believing that the spectacle of political violence would enhance the patriotic experience, they concocted a plan to raid the Centralia IWW Hall. IWW halls were of great practical and symbolic importance to workers. As Wobbly activist and historian Ralph Chaplin explains, the halls were loved by workers, but despised by employers. These \u201cchurches of the movement,\u201d as public historian Robert Weyeneth called them, represented the closest thing to a home for many wandering IWW members. Chaplin noted:<\/p> <p>\u201cIt is here the men can gather around a crackling wood fire, smoke their pipes and warm their souls with the glow of comradeship. Here they can, between jobs or after work, discuss the vicissitudes of their daily lives, read their books and magazines and sing their songs of solidarity, or merely listen to the \u201ctinned\u201d humor or harmony of the much prized Victrola. Also they here attend to the affairs of their union\u2014line up members, hold business and educational meetings and a weekly \u201copen forum.\u201d<\/p> <p>So, as the parading legionnaires passed the hall for the second time, they paused, then charged the hall, only to be surprised by the spirited defense they encountered. A volley of gunfire dropped three of the attackers, but the mob continued to press home its attack, capturing the hall. One additional legionnaire was killed in pursuit of Wesley Everest, who escaped out the back but was later captured and dragged by the neck to the jail. Later that night, he joined the ranks of IWW martyrs when he was lynched at the hands of Centralia businessmen and patriots, none of whom were ever prosecuted for his gruesome murder.<\/p> <p>The Armistice Day 1919 Centralia event is perhaps the single most written about event involving the IWW in the entire state of Washington. Analysis of the event has been extremely polarized, as interests representing the employing class and the working class have contested its meaning. And because of competing accounts, affidavits, and testimony, even some of the most basic facts of the case will probably never be established conclusively. What is perfectly clear is that the Centralia story must be understood in the context of the class struggle that had been raging on the Red Coast for over a decade and which had surfaced in Centralia since at least 1914. As all of the working-class accounts of the Centralia event note, violence and lawlessness were defining characteristics of the employers\u2019 approach to this conflict.<\/p> <p>The IWW served as the most logical target of employers\u2019 violence and repression because, since its inception in 1905, it represented the most advanced, class conscious, and revolutionary element of the working class in this country. The patriotic fervor of the First World War and fear that the Russian Revolution would heighten class consciousness among American workers only intensified persecution of the Wobblies. Sensing an opportunity, employers engaged both the state and the public in their efforts to crush the hated IWW. Nationally, the federal government enforced the wartime Espionage and Sedition Acts against the IWW and other radicals to imprison and deport many. In September of 1917, the federal government raided IWW halls across the country and indicted more than 160 leaders of the organization.<\/p> <p>At the state and local level, class warfare raged as employers mobilized both the state and the mob to lash out at class-conscious workers. Washington State was one of the great theaters of this conflict, as the teens witnessed the Grays Harbor and Pacific County Lumber Strike of 1912, multiple free speech fights, the 1916 Everett Massacre, and the 1919 Seattle General Strike.<\/p> <p>In Centralia, this war against workers effectively merged employers\u2019 traditional weapons\u2014a cooperative police, a captive legal system, and vigilante citizens\u2019 committees\u2014with the anti-radicalism and patriotism of the American Legion, a veterans\u2019 organization at the fore of anti-radical activities.<\/p> <p>The American Legion described Centralia like this: \u201cThe city is the center of a rich timber district and the logging camps of the northwest are infested with bearers of the red card, who boast that in many districts membership in the I.W.W. is a requisite to employment.\u201d The leadership of the Centralia Legion read like a roster of Centralia businessmen and the Legion became essentially a front organization, even the vanguard, for Northwest lumber bosses. In the words of Wobbly Ralph Chaplin, \u201cThe American Legion began to function as a cat\u2019s paw for the men behind the scenes.\u201d Indeed, there was nothing secret about the role of the Legion in the class war. The National Commander of the American Legion declared in 1923: \u201cIf ever needed, the American Legion stands ready to protect our country\u2019s institutions and ideals as the Fascisti dealt with the destructionists who menaced Italy. . . . Do not forget that the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States.\u201d<\/p> <p>Representatives of capital did not shy away from class conflict. An IWW organizer was run out of Centralia by the sheriff in 1914, and in early 1915 more Wobblies were \u201cescorted\u201d out of town by police and vigilantes. According to historian John McClelland, the local paper, the Centralia Chronicle, applauded anti-Wobbly repression and stated that it was everyone\u2019s responsibility to keep rebel workers out of Centralia. Tom Lassiter, a partially blind newsstand operator whose stock included labor and radical papers, was victimized by the business interest on several occasions. At various times, his radical papers were destroyed, he was threatened, arrested, kidnapped, and dumped in a ditch. Yet no one was ever prosecuted for any of these acts of class violence. In Centralia, it was clear, the law was a weapon in the hands of the propertied class.<\/p> <p>Perhaps inevitably, class conflict in Centralia came to center on the struggle to establish and defend an IWW union hall. As Chaplin notes, the \u201cunion halls were a standing challenge to their [the employers\u2019] hitherto undisputed right to the complete domination of the forests. . . . They were not going to tolerate the encroachments of the One Big Union of the lumber workers.\u201d In 1917, an IWW attempt to establish a hall was met with great hostility in the employer-dominated town, and the landlord evicted the Wobblies on learning of their identity. In the spring of 1918, Centralia employers targeted the town\u2019s new IWW hall. During a Red Cross parade, prominent businessmen, including members of the Centralia Elks, and political officials attacked and destroyed it. They beat IWW members and burned hall property and records in a street bonfire. F. B. Hubbard, the most prominent of the Centralia timber barons and president of the Washington Employers\u2019 Association, stole the desk from the Wobbly Hall and donated it to the local Chamber of Commerce. Despite the intimidation of the business leaders, the local IWW secretary, Britt Smith, opened a new hall on north Tower Avenue on September 1, 1919. It was clear for all to see that the IWW was not easily intimidated, but neither were their enemies.<\/p> <p>In July 1919, George Russell, secretary of the Washington Employers\u2019 Association, called a meeting of the Centralia Chamber of Commerce to find a way to destroy the IWW. F. B. Hubbard was picked to head a group designed to accomplish that objective. Although this was not the first meeting of Centralia business interests to combat the Wobbly threat, it marked a new level of organization on the part of capital that would not tolerate the affront the new IWW Hall afforded to its dominance.<\/p> <p>Plans to rid themselves of the enemy intensified with the formation of the Centralia Citizens Protective Association, the purpose of which, according to one local paper, was \u201cto combat IWW activities in this vicinity.\u201d Local businessmen were members of the Chamber of Commerce, the Centralia Elks, and the American Legion; many belonged to more than one of these organizations. Although the plans called for greater secrecy as to the specific methods to rid themselves of the Wobblies, too many people were aware of the plans to keep it secret. Word began to leak out, and soon it became public knowledge that the IWW would be driven out of town. Once the Armistice Day Parade was planned, the Wobblies knew that this was the pretense to attack their hall, destroy their property, and assault them.<\/p> <p>Initially, IWW members acted with uncommon prudence in attempting to prevent a violent attack on their hall. The owners of the Roderick Hotel, which housed the union hall and from whom the IWW rented, went to the local police with information about the planned attack. IWW members requested police protection. A trusted attorney, Elmer Smith, sought help from Governor Louis F. Hart in Olympia. The Wobblies even made a desperate appeal to the entire community. They distributed a lengthy handbill \u201cto the law-abiding citizens of Centralia and to the working class in general,\u201d which said, in part, \u201cThe profiteering class of Centralia have of late been waving the flag of our country in an endeavor to incite the lawless element of our city to raid our hall and club us out of town.\u201d But Wobbly pleas to avoid violence fell on deaf ears, and the police chief declined protection.<\/p> <p>Finally, as a last resort, the Wobblies sought legal advice from attorney Elmer Smith to determine whether they had the legal right to defend their hall with arms. Smith affirmed that they did. This was a major move on the part of the IWW. Although it had always shown remarkable restraint, the IWW was a defiant and proud group of class-conscious workers, and by November 1919 in Centralia Washington the Wobblies had had enough of the beatings, enough of the tar and featherings, enough of the destruction of their meager property, enough of the humiliation, and enough of the criminally brutal business-patriotic element. They would defend their hall, and plans for its self-defense were laid. Radical historian Harvey O\u2019Conner opined: \u201cPrudent men, valuing their own skins, would have closed the hall in the face of the obvious threat. But prudence was not a Wobbly trait. Rather their shining glory stood out<\/p> <p>in audacity, courage, and stubbornness in defense of their rights, and for that they are remembered in history.\u201d<\/p> <p>As the Armistice Day Parade got under way on the drizzly and ill-fated afternoon of November 11, 1919, the Wobblies made ready to defend their hall. They positioned armed men inside the hall and also in three locations outside the hall: in the Avalon and Arnold Hotels on the opposite (east) side of the street, and on Seminary Hill which overlooked the street from some considerable distance away. The parade route took the marchers north on Tower Avenue past the main business district to Third Street, the next side street past the IWW Hall, in a section of town occupied by businesses catering to the working class. At Third Street the marchers reversed direction to return now southbound on Tower Avenue with the Centralia American Legion contingent making up the rear of the parade. In front of the IWW Hall, the marchers paused and then rushed the hall.<\/p> <p>Shots rang out from the hall and then from Seminary Hill and the Avalon Hotel. Three Legionnaires\u2014Warren Grimm, Arthur McElfresh, and Ben Cassagranda\u2014received fatal wounds on the streets near the hall, and Dale Hubbard, the nephew of the lumbar baron F. B. Hubbard, was shot by a fleeing Wesley Everest at the edge of the Skookumchuck river. Hubbard died later that night. Several other marchers were injured, and the IWW Hall was smashed and its contents dragged to the street and burned. Wesley Everest was severely beaten and dragged back into town and thrown in a heap on the jail floor. One of the marchers who pursued Everest to the river and presumably helped drag him to the jail was Legionnaire Ed Cunningham, who was picked by the American Legion to become the Special Prosecutor in the trial against the Centralia Wobblies. According to the Legion account, \u201cCunningham was able to use his first-hand knowledge of the tragedy to telling effect.\u201d<\/p> <p>In many of their clashes with the working class, employers hired detective agencies or relied on local or state police to combat workers, but in Centralia the American Legion served as the armed guard of the employing class. As news of the event spread, the American Legion assumed control of the town, controlled the flow of information, formed vigilante groups to hunt down suspected Wobblies, and raided establishments and homes. In touting the Legion takeover, the American Legion Weekly stated, \u201cThough the office of the Sheriff and the Chief of Police assisted as much as possible, their forces were small and their aid nominal,\u201d and \u201cPosses which scoured the country about Centralia in search of fugitives were made up almost exclusively of American Legion men\u201d<\/p> <p>That evening, two meetings were held at the Elks Club in which the murder of Wesley Everest was conceivably planned. At about five o\u2019clock a group of men was told to go the armory for weapons and return to the Elks at six o\u2019clock. At the six o\u2019clock meeting, all assembled men who were not members of the Elks or the American Legion were asked to leave. In effect, this left the established business class and the Legion, those that could most be trusted to carry out a class lynching and protect those involved in it. This meeting lasted until about seven o\u2019clock. At seven-thirty, someone visited the city\u2019s power station and shut off all the lights in Centralia. Meanwhile, a lynching party entered the jail where Wesley Everest was held. The lynching party\u2014meeting no opposition from the jailer\u2014seized Everest and dragged him to a waiting automobile.<\/p> <p>The automobile that held Everest fell in with a procession of automobiles containing Centralia\u2019s most prominent citizens, and proceeded to the Chehalis River Bridge. Radical author Harvey O\u2019Conner graphically described the scene:<\/p> <p>\u201cAt the bridge Everest was dragged out and rope knotted around his neck, and his body flung over. Everest clutched at a plank; Legionnaires stamped on his fingers, and he fell. Dissatisfied with the knot, the lynchers pulled the body back up and used a longer rope, and hurled the body over again. Still dissatisfied, they hauled Everest body up a third time\u2014by then he must have been dead\u2014and tied a more professional knot on a longer rope and flung the body over. Then with carlights playing on the scene, they amused themselves awhile by shooting at the swaying body. Satiated at last, the mob left and darkness returned. Next morning somebody cut the rope and the body fell into the Chehalis River.\u201d<\/p> <p>The next day, Everest\u2019s mutilated body was retrieved from the river, dumped on the jail floor, and left for two days in plain view of his imprisoned fellow workers. As Centralia\u2019s authorities were no doubt complicit in the lynching, no attempt was ever made to bring the Everest\u2019s murderers to justice. As the Legion-led posses combed the surrounding area for more Wobblies, state authorities interrogated the jailed Wobblies by day as the enraged mobs terrorized them by night. In the woods surrounding Centralia, one posse member was shot and killed when he was mistaken by another for a Wobbly. This shooting, first reported as a murder committed by a Wobbly, was later ruled an accident.<\/p> <p>As this reign of terror continued in southwest Washington, the commercial press continued to churn out propagandistic accounts of how the Wobblies ambushed and murdered America\u2019s finest young men in the streets of Centralia. Characteristic of this treatment was the front-page article in the Chehalis Bee-Nugget: \u201cIWW Shoot into Armistice Day Parade in Centralia Tuesday. Warren Grimm, Arthur McElfresh, Dale Hubbard, and Ben Cassagranda Killed by the Assassins.\u201d Authorities, businessmen, and Legionnaires combined to attack workers in other parts of the state and in neighboring Oregon. In Seattle, the Department of Justice seized the Union Record, the official organ of the Seattle Central Labor Council, and arrested its staff, including Harry Ault and Anna Louise Strong, on charges of sedition.<\/p> <p>The passions that this class war engendered were still highly visible on January 26, 1920, when eleven Wobblies, including Elmer Smith, the attorney who advised the IWW members that they had the legal right to defend their hall, were brought to trial in the town of Montesano, the county seat of neighboring Grays Harbor County. The defense faced many obstacles in the trial, beginning with a huge resource disparity. The Wobblies were represented by George Vanderveer with occasional help from his law partner, Ralph Pierce, and attorney Elmer Smith, himself a defendant in the case. Meanwhile, Special Prosecutor Ed Cunningham led a staff of six attorneys, whom Vanderveer referred to as the attorneys for the lumber trust. The Luke May Secret Service, a private detective agency paid for by lumber company funds, aided them.<\/p> <p>Finally, the American Legion recruited some fifty uniformed veterans to sit in on the trial by day, presumably to influence the jury. They were paid four dollars a day from funds contributed by the lumber companies and the Elks. The prosecution certainly lived up to its reputation as the counsel for the lumber trust. Special Prosecutor Cunningham was himself deeply involved in the Armistice Day violence. He was one of the members of the mob that pursued Everest to the Skookumchuck River and helped drag him to jail. He watched while the mob broke into the jail and kidnapped Everest, and was alleged to have witnessed his murder. Historian Tom Copeland observed that \u201cas Cunningham built the case against the Wobblies, he was also shielding himself from any potential legal action for his role in the raid and lynching.\u201d<\/p> <p>Cunningham\u2019s team successfully fought off a change of venue request, claiming there was no prejudice against the IWW in either Centralia or Montesano. In a clear attempt to intimidate anyone willing to testify for the defense, the prosecution had two defense witnesses arrested for perjury when they finished their testimony. The prosecution called on the governor to have troops from Camp Lewis sent to Montesano to stand guard outside the courtroom, thereby frightening the jury into thinking that an IWW attack was imminent.<\/p> <p>The trial was, in fact, a mere extension of the class war, a political trial in which the authorities put the IWW on trial while pretending to adhere to the rule of law. The judge, John M. Wilson, insisted that he could try the case impartially, despite the fact that he had delivered an anti-IWW speech in the nearby town of Bucoda and had addressed the memorial service at the Centralia Elks commemorating the Legionnaires who had been killed during the Armistice Day Parade. Wilson rejected the defense\u2019s request for a change of venue from Montesano, disallowed much of the evidence that Vanderveer tried to introduce during the trial, and made numerous prejudicial rulings that favored the prosecution and infuriated the defense. Vanderveer captured the trial\u2019s essence in his closing statement. The prosecutors, he told the jury, \u201chave told you this was a murder trial, and not a labor trial. But vastly more than the lives of ten men are the stakes in the big gamble here; for the right of workers to organize for the bettering of their own condition is on trial; the right of free assemblage is on trial; democracy and Americanism are on trial.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cIn view of such a charged atmosphere,\u201d Albert Gunns contended, \u201cthe final verdict of the jury was moderate.\u201d The prosecution sought a first-degree murder verdict for all of the defendants, but the jury did not agree. Elmer Smith, the Wobbly attorney, was acquitted, along with one other defendant. Seven defendants were convicted of second-degree murder, and one young defendant was judged legally insane. The jury attached to their verdict a written request for leniency in sentencing, but Judge Wilson rendered stiff sentences ranging from 25 to 40 years in the state penitentiary in Walla Walla.<\/p> <p>Irish immigrant James McInerney, himself a veteran of the Everett Massacre and victim of torture while in the Centralia jail, died while imprisoned, \u201cmurdered,\u201d the Industrial Worker proclaimed, \u201cby the Capitalist class.\u201d Most of the remaining prisoners remained incarcerated until 1933, when Governor Clarence Martin commuted their sentences.<\/p> <p>Several jurors were clearly uneasy with their decision, believing that they were not allowed to hear all of the important evidence. \u201cRemarkably, two years after the trial,\u201d Robert Weyeneth concludes, \u201cseven of the twelve jurors voluntarily repudiated their verdict.\u201d No member of the employing class or its \u201ccat paws\u201d was ever charged or even investigated for Everest\u2019s murder or the Armistice Day hall raid that ushered in the Centralia Tragedy.<\/p> <p>Aaron Goings, Brian Barnes and Roger Snider are authors of The Red Coast: Radicalism and Anti-Radicalism in

He was eventually released around Ajah.<\/p> <p>\u201cA ransom was paid but I didn\u2019t know the amount. In any case police were not party to ransom payment.

The victims spent 64 days in captivity before they were released after ransom payment.<\/p> <p>In June 2017, suspected kidnappers wrote Lagos State Model College, Kankon, Badagry, threatening to abduct some pupils and staff members of the school \u201cthe same way we did at Igbonla, Epe.\u201d The attack was however averted.<\/p> <p>Earlier, in March 2016, three schoolgirls at Babington Macaulay Junior Seminary School, Ikorodu, were abducted by gunmen.

At the time, Shehbaz Sharif took notice of the report, commenting that Pakistan would lose its GSP-Plus trading status with the EU and deter other foreign investment if it did not improve the environment for the press.<\/p> <p>This is hardly the resounding, principled defence of media freedom that one would want from political leaders who are fashioning themselves as the saviours of Pakistani democracy. But it is the type of practical assessment that may spur meaningful action from a politician known for pragmatism and outcomes. And after the three-and-a-half-year battering that the press has endured during Imran Khan\u2019s tenure, any steps towards improved media freedom \u2014 irrespective of what motivates them \u2014 should be welcomed. But is the younger Sharif ready to take them?<\/p> <p>The clampdown on media is among the darkest aspects of Khan\u2019s legacy. Pakistan slipped by six points to 145th position in the World Press Freedom Index 2021. During Khan\u2019s tenure, the media was stripped of freedom and funding. Journalists were harassed, abducted and tortured. News outlets were denied advertising revenue or blocked outright. The PTI government also worked hard (though mercifully failed) to centralise media control through a proposed Pakistan Media Development Authority, which would have had the power to shut down any news outlet, without offering any notice or justification, or being subject to legal challenge.<\/p> <p>The most absurd demonstration of the PTI government\u2019s disdain for the press was the passage of the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021, long sought as a way to offer some recourse for journalists under threat. Section 6 of that bill undermined the legislation entirely, as it prohibited media workers from spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d, advocating hatred or inciting violence. The vague wording of the section was widely perceived as an attempt by the government to muzzle journalists, empowering the state to label all critical reporting as fake news.<\/p> <p>Will the new set-up defend press freedom?<\/p> <p>The recent political turbulence has eased pressure on the press. As institutions have been embroiled in power tussles, journalists have noted a slowdown in directives, less harassment, and increased opportunities for critical reporting. How long will this last? What can one expect from a PML-N-led coalition, given the party\u2019s own sordid history with the press, from Najam Sethi\u2019s 1999 arrest on trumped-up treason charges to the passage in 2015 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, which enabled a crackdown on online free speech?<\/p> <p>Restoring a modicum of press freedom should be a no-brainer for the coalition government. This should include an easing off on news outlets as well as concrete acts such as the removal of Section 6 from the journalists\u2019 protection legislation and increasing government advertising budgets for news outlets. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has already demanded as much from Sharif.<\/p> <p>Such steps would quickly demonstrate that the Sharif-led coalition government is truly committed to the democratic values it championed during the no-confidence vote, and that it intends to approach governance in a radically different way from Khan. It would also change the growing public perception that all our political leaders are merely puppets, caught in an endless game of musical chairs, and give hope that genuine democratic progress is possible.<\/p> <p>The coalition parties under Sharif have a choice to make. They can either sink to Khan\u2019s level and play his dangerous games, or they can learn from their experience as an embattled opposition \u2014 as well as from the resilience of our Constitution as demonstrated by recent events \u2014 and do things differently, better. This choice will apply across all areas of governance, but also in how they approach the media.<\/p> <p>The recent arrests by the FIA of PTI social media activists on charges of smearing the army and judiciary and the suspension of thousands of PTI-linked social media accounts are tactics from PTI\u2019s censorship and intimidation book. As the battle of narratives between Khan and the military over Cable\u00adgate escalates, we\u2019re likely to see the establishment resort to various means to prevent the armed forces from being publicly mali\u00adgned. This may include pressure on the media to promote one narrative over the other, including through undemocratic means such as media blackouts of PTI rallies.<\/p> <p>The new government must work hard to prevent this. Such a crackdown will further rile PTI ranks, and give their conspiracies and victimhood narratives more power. It will also confirm to those who had serious reservations about Khan\u2019s ruling tactics that the alternatives are not much better. For the sake of foreign investment, if nothing else, let\u2019s hope Sharif defends Pakistan\u2019s beleaguered press.<\/p> <p>The writer is a political and integrity risk analyst.<\/p> <p>Twitter: @humayusuf<\/p> <p>Published in Dawn, April 18th, 2022<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3VADEH0UHECZKEB383LVAYW6NMIPSO"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"e365eb66-c5f8-42de-9298-f3cba96a4e2e","work_time_in_seconds":2629,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"01","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Shehbaz Sharif","victim_keywords":"Prime Minister","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Najam Sethi\u2019s","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2021","month":"01","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Pakistan","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Shehbaz Sharif","victim_keywords":"Prime Minister","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Najam Sethi\u2019s","victim_keywords":null,"victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":968540516,"Input.title":"Alphabet Workers Union Tests Tech Industry Appetite for Unionization","Input.publish_date":"2021-02-08 11:00:49","Input.article_interface":"<p>Over the last decade, technology companies have been easing past traditional oil and gas conglomerates to become the wealthiest industry in the world. And yet, despite that vast wealth, there is still a massive tech talent gap. And now there\u2019s a growing trend of tech workers coming together to call for greater unionization in this sector. This is moving beyond petitions and signed letters from staff, to increased walkouts, employee resource groups, and even formal trade unions.<\/p> <p>On January 4, the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) launched with 230 members, instantly making it the biggest tech union. A few weeks later, the membership of this American and Canadian union, which includes permanent, contracted and vendor company employees of Google, its subsidiaries, and other Alphabet Inc. brands, has quadrupled. Earlier this week, international Googlers across 13 countries formed a coalition of unions called Alpha Global.<\/p> <p>\u201cTogether, we will change Alphabet,\u201d the global alliance commits.<\/p> <p>But Google employees aren\u2019t the first to want to change their tech companies and we are pretty sure they won\u2019t be the last. So today we reflect on the growing mobilization of people in tech, and try to predict where it\u2019s headed.<\/p> <p>OK, Google, How\u2019d You Get Here?<\/p> <p>We write it a lot \u2014 if the tech industry is building the future, then we have to be sure what kind of future we\u2019re building. But before it goes cross-industry, any push for change often starts within a company. In tech\u2019s case, it started with Google.<\/p> <p>\u201cAt Google, we have a really long history of employee activism. A decade or more of working together to steer the company in an ethical direction,\u201d Andrew Gainer-Dewar, Google software engineer and spokesperson for AWU, recently told The New Stack.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t do evil. Do the right thing. These used to be the mottos for Google. But, in April 2018, when the world learned of the now-infamous Project Maven contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for AI-backed drone feeds, about four percent of the Google staff wrote an open letter to the Alphabet CEO, demanding not only that Google pull out of the contract, but that \u201cGoogle draft, publicize and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.\u201d In the minds of these Google employees, adding muscle to a war machine could be viewed as doing evil, and they were complicit in this direction (Google declined to interviewed for this story, though provided written commentary and associated resources).<\/p> <p>\u201cThe company is an architect of the new world of work. It is a major incubator of innovations, and as a technology leader, it is a laboratory for new methods of communications and working. Unfortunately, Alphabet is also a creator of inequalities, implicated in sexual harassment and oppression of sexual minorities and people of colour. It is a place where many workers came to change the world \u2014 to make it more democratic \u2014 only to find Alphabet suppressing speech and cracking down on worker organizing while consolidating monopolistic power.\u201d \u2014 Alpha Global<\/p> <p>Among other things, this letter notably stated \u2014 in bold \u2014 that the Project Maven affiliation \u201cwill irreparably damage Google\u2019s brand and its ability to compete for talent.\u201d This feels pointed, like it was reminding their boss how hard tech talent is to come by. Google decided not to renew its Project Maven contract and even created a new set of AI principles, which specifies that its AI research should not be used for weapons.<\/p> <p>Now, while Google got rid of the simple statement, \u201cDon\u2019t do evil,\u201d that wittily ended their much more extensive Code of Conduct with: \u201cAnd remember\u2026 don\u2019t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn\u2019t right \u2014 speak up!\u201d<\/p> <p>However, Google\u2019s response to people speaking up has been less than welcoming.<\/p> <p>In November 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees staged a global walkout to protest the way the company handled sexual harassment and pay inequality, and to end forced arbitration where all lawsuits had to be settled out of court.<\/p> <p>In September 2019, a group of about 80 Google contract workers who worked on-site in Pittsburgh, in an effort to bargain over wages and working conditions, voted to unionize and join United Steelworkers. The outsourcing company working for Google, in response, started a trend of offshoring that work to Poland, the protesters alleged. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which handles U.S. labor law, has scheduled a hearing.<\/p> <p>In November 2019, a few more employees were fired for organizing a protest against the company\u2019s work with the U.S. Border Patrol.<\/p> <p>Then a few weeks later, four employees \u2014 hence known as the Thanksgiving Four \u2014 were fired, allegedly accused of \u201cbreaking security policies\u201d in their efforts to expose Google\u2019s work with notorious union-busting firm IRI Consultants. Of course, this only served to make public Google\u2019s affiliation with IRI public knowledge.<\/p> <p>The ex-Googlers partnered with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and, in part, successfully petitioned the NRLB to challenge Google. This last December, the NRLB issued a complaint against Google for unlawfully monitoring and questioning several workers who were then fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union.<\/p> <p>This complaint charged that Google repeatedly violated U.S. labor law by using \u201cterminations and intimidation in order to quell workplace activism.\u201d It also charged that Google\u2019s checking of employee calendars \u2014 installing a tool on employees\u2019 web browsers that flagged internal calendar events requiring more than ten meeting rooms or 100 participants \u2014 to be \u201cunlawful surveillance.\u201d<\/p> <p>Google\u2019s official response to this step by the NRLB:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe strongly support the rights our employees have in the workplace, and open discussion and respectful debate have always been part of Google\u2019s culture. We\u2019re proud of that culture and are committed to defending it against attempts by individuals to deliberately undermine it \u2014 including by violating security policies and internal systems. The NLRB determined today that Google was justified in terminating three employees who violated our data security policies.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to provide information to the NLRB and the administrative judge about our decision to terminate or discipline employees who abused their privileged access to internal systems, such as our security tools or colleagues\u2019 calendars. Such actions are a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility, and we will be defending our position.\u201d<\/p> <p>This case will be brought in front of an administrative law judge on April 12.<\/p> <p>Also last December, Google made headlines and inspired outrage again when it fired then Co-Lead of Google\u2019s Ethical AI team Dr. Timnit Gebru, which Gebru charged was an effort to suppress her research and her internal criticism of Google\u2019s lack of genuine diversity efforts and lack of transparency surrounding both employee and research feedback.<\/p> <p>On Dec. 4, Jeff Dean, senior fellow and head of Google\u2019s research organization, publicly shared an internal email sent the day before that outlined the chain of events leading up to \u201cher decision to resign from Google.\u201d<\/p> <p>About 2,700 Googlers have signed a letter standing with Gebru, stating that Gebru\u2019s exit was a termination not a resignation and dubbing Google\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented research censorship\u201d and the letter includes the following:<\/p> <p>\u201cInstead of being embraced by Google as an exceptionally talented and prolific contributor, Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing\u2026 The termination is an act of retaliation against Dr. Gebru, and it heralds danger for people working for ethical and just AI \u2014 especially Black people and People of Color \u2014 across Google.\u201d<\/p> <p>Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also wrote a letter on Dec. 9 saying that the company was opening a review to \u201cassess the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru\u2019s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process.\u201d There hasn\u2019t been an official response from Alphabet since.<\/p> <p>Just this week AWU filed an unfair labor practice charge against Modis Engineering, a subcontractor that provides data center services for Google, on behalf of contractor and AWU member Shannon Wait. Wait was suspended last week after she complained on behalf of herself and other workers about conditions at the center, which includes a prohibition of talk about salaries. According to Wait, workers at the South Carolina Google data center, who often perform heavy manual labor, have seen their daily repairs doubled during the pandemic, increasing safety concerns.<\/p> <p>And not to just focus on the organizing work of the technical, so-called white-collar staff of Google, up until this month the most significant unionizing effort was back in December 2019 by about 2,300 Google Silicon Valley cafeteria workers. These workers are among Google\u2019s majority shadow workforce, which generally shares in worse, stagnant wages and benefits, while these particular workers live in the wildly expensive Silicon Valley. These service workers were following suit of 500 Facebook cafeteria workers who unionized back in 2017.<\/p> <p>Still, these cafeteria workers aren\u2019t the majority of Googlers and working for the world\u2019s fifth-richest company is still what many people in tech dream of. So what\u2019s the point of starting a union?<\/p> <p>Unionization efforts are also taking place within other IT companies.<\/p> <p>About a year ago, Kickstarter United OPEIU Local 153 was formed. Kickstarter was the first major tech company to unionize, under the chartered goals of \u201ctransparency, inclusion, solidarity, accountability, and joy\u201d and of supporting \u201corganizing efforts across the tech industry.\u201d<\/p> <p>In an industry defined by scrambling for venture capitalist investment, Kickstarter\u2019s employees stood out as reflective of a turning point for tech employee activism \u2014 not the impetus, but the first to reveal their plans.<\/p> <p>OPEIU is taking seriously the commitment we unanimously made at our 2019 convention to organize in the tech sector. Today, we\u2019re officially launching @techunion1010 \u2014 a union by & for tech workers. Read our statement on this historic day https:\/\/t.co\/8tj9fXlB6n #TechWorkers pic.twitter.com\/2cOp9LcPbb \u2014 OPEIU #PassThePROAct  (@OPEIU) January 25, 2021<\/p> <p>What\u2019s a White-Collar, Non-Binding Union to Do?<\/p> <p>The difference is that, while anomalistic for the tech industry, Kickstarter United is a traditional union with collective bargaining power. And the crowdfunding platform has less than 250 employees.<\/p> <p>There are 250,000 Alphabet employees and contracted workers worldwide. AWU includes everyone from the permanent employees to that shadow workforce, from cloud architects to massage therapists, including staff who could already be in other traditional sector unions.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are the first wall-to-wall whole company union,\u201d Gainer-Dewer said, which, at the time of the interview, just covered the U.S. and Canada officially through a CWA partnership.<\/p> <p>Joining AWU is completely voluntary. An Alphabet worker just has to fill out a form and sign a card, and then the union performs an employment check. Dues are one percent of total compensation, which Gainer-Dewer says seems on the low side for affiliated industries.<\/p> <p>The Alphabet Workers Union is filed as a so-called minority union, which means it can\u2019t leverage collective bargaining. Under U.S. labor law, Alphabet Inc. can ignore the union\u2019s demands until a majority of employees support it. However, there is something to be said about the power in numbers, particularly when tech retention is so directly tied to profits.<\/p> <p>Google responded to the announcement of AWU in early January, by way of director of people operations Kara Silverstein, with: \u201cWe\u2019ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce. Of course, our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we\u2019ve always done, we\u2019ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.\u201d<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer dubbed this \u201ccorporate doublespeak\u201d that Google says they \u201cwill continue to engage directly to all employees which they haven\u2019t done in years and will continue not to do.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said that Alphabet Inc\u2019s \u201cexecutive strategy has been to pretend we are irrelevant, and aggressive retaliation will be a part of that.\u201d<\/p> <p>So, without collective bargaining and other big union wins, and when Google has unofficially acted increasingly anti-union and even overtly retaliated against people for organizing, why pay to join AWU?<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer was compelled to get involved in organizing after the Thanksgiving Four fires because, in his words, he witnessed \u201cthis escalation from engaging with employees to ignoring employees to really aggressively retaliating. Made me worry the next time no one would or could speak up.\u201d<\/p> <p>As our short history lesson proves, Alphabet employees have a formed a habit of inner-company activism, but now it\u2019s about making it sustainable.<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer said that while \u201cPeople have been organizing to stand up to leadership for a very long time, building this kind of sustainable long-term structure to build our organizing capacity is new,\u201d maybe 18 months in the works.<\/p> <p>He continued, \u201cWe are building a structure that can support continued growth and building resilience over time.\u201d<\/p> <p>Resilience isn\u2019t just referring to momentum, but also, in the past, those who have tried to stand up, without this support infrastructure in place, experienced a lot of burnout.<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer said AWU members are also looking to foster a \u201cresilient capacity to speak with a collective voice, to have all of our members democratically reach consensus on what\u2019s important to us, and to speak up to executives.\u201d<\/p> <p>While the most significant milestone is AWU growing past 800 members in its first three weeks, it has already seemed to have influenced some of Alphabet Inc\u2019s decision making.<\/p> <p>After the Jan. 6 insurgence on the U.S. Capitol, AWU criticized Alphabet subsidiary YouTube\u2019s response of just taking down President Donald Trump\u2019s video that seems to have incited the domestic terrorist attack.<\/p> <p>AWU\u2019s official response called this \u201clackluster, demonstrating a continued policy of selective and insufficient enforcement of its guidelines against the use of the platform to spread hatred and extremism.\u201d<\/p> <p>Soon after the union\u2019s statement, YouTube revised its response to offer the Trump account an equivalent of a second strike, which means the account is frozen for at least two weeks.<\/p> <p>Last week, AWU also responded to the suspension of the corporate access of Margaret Mitchell, AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team, which notably lost Gebru a month earlier.<\/p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt if nothing else, the formation of this union has the media\u2019s ears open to the concerns of this sub-section of Alphabet employees.<\/p> <p>Is the Tech Industry on the Cusp of Change?<\/p> <p>Gainer-Dewer says it feels like a historic moment for tech giants to form unions.<\/p> <p>He said, \u201cI suspect there are groups of other people at other big tech companies, writing the open letters and doing the petitions.\u201d<\/p> <p>Just this last week, the union Kickstarter United is affiliate with \u2014 the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), AFL-CIO \u2014 has announced \u201cthe formation of its Tech Workers Union Local 1010, an arm of the union with a mission to raise industry standards and provide all tech workers a better future in their workplaces through collective bargaining.\u201d<\/p> <p>There are already chapters of the Tech Workers Union in tech hotspots Austin, Boston, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, as well as in Brazil, Italy, the Netherlands, Berlin, London and Bangalore, India. TWU\u2019s definition of a \u201ctech worker\u201d is anyone involved in the tech industry in any capacity, ranging from programmers and designers to product managers to gig workers like Uber drivers and even to students. Google, Microsoft, ASOS, Monzo and Deliveroo are said to be planning to join the London chapter.<\/p> <p>There is also a movement to unionize tech workers in the Global South.<\/p> <p>The New Stack looks forward to watching this space to see what comes next when tech turns activist.<\/p> <p>Feature image by Cytonn Photography on Unsplash.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"34XASH8KLS1WMJYYO6P9YPX0VX0PMC"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"e365eb66-c5f8-42de-9298-f3cba96a4e2e","work_time_in_seconds":1997,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2018","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Alphabet Workers","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Margaret Mitchell","victim_keywords":"AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Donald Trump","victim_keywords":"President","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"regional orgs","violation_types":["unknown"],"year":"2018","month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"US","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Alphabet Workers","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Margaret Mitchell","victim_keywords":"AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Donald Trump","victim_keywords":"President","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":941749996,"Input.title":"US won\u2019t seek death penalty against pair of IS militants","Input.publish_date":"2020-08-19 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>WASHINGTON - The Justice Department has notified the British government that it will not pursue the death penalty against two Islamic State militants suspected in the beheadings of Western hostages, removing a hurdle in the potential prosecution of the men in the United States.<\/p> <p>The decision could open the door to Britain to begin sharing evidence with federal prosecutors in the U.S. for any possible case against El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey. An earlier British court ruling had effectively blocked the sharing of evidence with American authorities because the U.S. had not offered assurances that the death penalty, which was abolished years ago in the United Kingdom, was off the table.<\/p> <p>\u201cI know that the United Kingdom shares our determination that there should be a full investigation and a criminal prosecution of Kotey and Elsheikh,\u201d Attorney General William Barr wrote to British Home Secretary Priti Patel in a letter released by the Justice Department on Wednesday.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese men are alleged to be members of the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and to have been involved in kidnappings, murders, and other violent crimes against the citizens of our two countries, as well as the citizens of other countries,\u201d he added.<\/p> <p>Though the U.S. wants to prosecute the men, Barr told the British that the U.S. would move forward with plans to transfer them to the Iraqi criminal justice system for prosecution if American authorities do not soon receive the evidence that they seek.<\/p> <p>The British men, captured two years ago by a Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed militia, are accused of participation in a brutal Islamic State group known for beheadings and barbaric treatment of American aid workers, journalists and other hostages in Syria.<\/p> <p>U.S. officials have not announced any charges against the men, but have spoken of their desire to see members of the cell, nicknamed the \u201cBeatles\u201d by surviving captives because of their British accents, face justice.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf we receive the requested evidence and attendant co-operation from the United Kingdom, we intend to proceed with a United States prosecution,\u201d Barr wrote. \u201cIndeed, it is these unique circumstances that have led me to provide the assurance offered in this letter.\u201d<\/p> <p>The men were transferred to U.S. custody last October as Turkey invaded Syria to attack Kurds who were battling the Islamic State alongside American forces.<\/p> <p>They are being held by the military overseas. Barr said that was not a tenable long-term solution, so he set a deadline for action.<\/p> <p>He said the British government had until Oct. 15 to resolve any legal objections it may have and to provide U.S. authorities with the evidence they seek. Otherwise, the men will be transferred to Iraqi custody for prosecution by Iraqi authorities. He reassured the British that the U.S. would not provide to third countries that might impose the death penalty any evidence it has already received or may receive from the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>The British government confirmed that it had received the letter, with the Home Office saying in a statement that its top priority has always been to protect national security and to deliver justice for families of the victims.<\/p> <p>The decision is a significant development in years of wrangling over Kotey and Elsheikh. The U.S. and British governments have an agreement to share documents, records and other evidence in criminal investigations. In 2015, the Justice Department asked for evidence that Britain had gathered on the \u201cBeatles,\u201d saying it was doing its own investigation into Americans who were murdered in Syria.<\/p> <p>British authorities had been willing to provide the U.S. with evidence even without assurances that the men would not be executed if convicted.<\/p> <p>But in July 2018, after lawyers for Elsheikh demanded a review of the decision to allow the men to be put on trial in the U.S., Britain\u2019s Home Office said it had temporarily suspended co-operation with U.S authorities on a potential handover.<\/p> <p>Then, in March, the British Supreme Court held that it was unlawful for the United Kingdom to provide evidence to a foreign country that could be used for a death penalty prosecution. The court has not yet issued its final order, Barr said, but even after that order there could be additional litigation to block transfer of the evidence.<\/p> <p>The IS militants known as the \u201cBeatles\u201d held Western hostages in Syria and tortured many of them, beheading a group of journalists and aid workers in gruesome videos that were released to the world as propaganda.<\/p> <p>The British leader of the \u201cBeatles\u201d cell, Mohammed Emwazi, who was also known as \u201cJihadi John,\u201d was killed in a 2015 drone strike.<\/p> <p>Emwazi was responsible for the beheading of James Foley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist who was killed in Syria six yeas ago after being kidnapped by militants.<\/p> <p>His mother, Diane Foley, said in an interview that she was gratified by the Justice Department\u2019s action, which Barr had said would be coming soon in a conversation with her and other victims\u2019 families this month.<\/p> <p>\u201cI feel that both countries ideally should work together to hold these men accountable and give them a fair trial,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIf they are guilty, they need to be put away for the rest of their lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>She said the only way to stop acts of terrorism was to hold perpetrators accountable.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis would be a huge step, so I am just very, very hopeful and grateful to the attorney general\u201d and the Justice Department, she said.<\/p> <p>_____<\/p> <p>Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.<\/p> <p>Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/etuckerAP<\/p> <p>SHARE:<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"3EHVO81VN707DDELC7Y65O76BW9H17"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"ef69561c-f6be-482d-885f-0151057a3fab","work_time_in_seconds":407,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Syria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Foley","victim_keywords":"journalist, beheaded, victim, Syria","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, aid workers, killed, Syria, tortured","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping","killing","other","torture"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Syria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"James Foley","victim_keywords":"journalist, beheaded, victim, Syria","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"journalists, aid workers, killed, Syria, tortured","victim_type":["journalist","insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1037308104,"Input.title":"Amazon Labor Union wins election at Amazon warehouse in New York City","Input.publish_date":"2022-04-02 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Amazon Labor Union was declared the winner Friday in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) contest held in Staten Island, New York.

Another ALU election is planned for April 25 at the LDJ5 warehouse on Staten Island, which employs roughly 1,600 workers.<\/p> <p>The ALU\u2019s victory came a day after results were announced for a similar union election at Amazon held in Bessemer, Alabama. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) is losing the vote at the BHM1 fulfillment center, where it received only 875 \u201cyes\u201d votes to 993 \u201cno\u201d votes. Several hundred contested ballots are currently being litigated, and the result will be announced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) within the next few weeks.<\/p> <p>The highly depressed turnout (only 39 percent) for the Alabama vote came despite glowing media coverage and high-profile political support from Biden and other Democrats. Biden\u2019s NLRB allowed the RWDSU to re-run the election after an initial attempt failed.<\/p> <p>The larger turnout at the JFK8 facility may be attributed to the fact that the ALU has promoted itself as an independent union, run by current and former Amazon workers. Christian Smalls, the ALU\u2019s leader, is a former JFK8 worker who was fired in 2020 after he and several co-workers organized a walkout in protest of Amazon\u2019s lackluster COVID-19 protections.<\/p> <p>In another difference from the RWDSU campaign, the ALU raised a specific set of demands of the company, including raises to $30 an hour, more vacation days and paid time off as well as an increase in break times during shifts. Numerous investigations have revealed the widespread occurrence of workers injuring themselves in Amazon\u2019s vast warehouses as well as foregoing rest times and bathroom breaks in order to make obscenely high \u201crates.\u201d<\/p> <p>A New York Times investigation of the JFK8 warehouse last year determined that the corporation tracked \u201cevery minute of most warehouse workers\u2019 shifts, from how fast they packed merchandise to how long they paused\u2026 If productivity flagged, Amazon\u2019s computers assumed the worker was to blame.\u201d<\/p> <p>No doubt, many workers voting for the ALU did so out of a desire to improve their conditions and carry out a fight against the corporation and its multi-billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos.<\/p> <p>Such a fight, however, requires the mobilization of the working class independently of the corporatist trade unions, which are heavily promoted by sections of the ruling class, particularly the Democratic Party, as critical instruments for the suppression of the class struggle. This requires the development of a network of rank-and-file committees, democratically controlled by the workers themselves.<\/p> <p>While the ALU claims to be independent, its orientation is in fact to the trade union apparatus, a section of which sees in such initiatives (at Amazon, Starbucks and other companies) a method to somehow revive support for thoroughly discredited organizations.<\/p> <p>Tellingly, Democratic Party-connected media outlets have heaped praise on Smalls and the ALU. As it has throughout the entire Amazon unionization campaign, the Times led the way, declaring the JFK8 vote \u201ca stunning win\u201d and \u201cone of the biggest victories for organized labor in a generation.\u201d The Democratic Socialists of America-aligned Jacobin magazine, which sees as its principal role the strengthening of the trade union apparatus, called it a \u201cDavid-and-Goliath\u2026 fight between the independent union and one of the world\u2019s most powerful companies.\u201d<\/p> <p>There are already numerous signs that Smalls and the ALU are open to an approach from the RWDSU or other pro-corporate organizations. Speaking to NPR about the RWDSU, Smalls declared \u201cI hope they\u2019re successful\u2026 We know we show our support and solidarity with them.\u201d The RWDSU\u2019s president Stuart Appelbaum, a longtime Democratic Party and state operative, has offered to \u201csupport them [the ALU] and not look for anything in return\u201d if \u201cChris runs out of money.\u201d<\/p> <p>During the campaign for unionization at JFK, the ALU borrowed office space from the Unite Here, an organization (with $150 million in assets) that has played a critical role in isolating and defeating the struggles of service workers\u2014and keeping them on the job during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that in the aftermath of its victory at Amazon, the fledgling ALU will have more than just office space offered to it.

The rottenness of the British state is seen in the ever-swifter decay of its once vaunted institutions \u2013 in particular its supposedly impartial legal system. We have had numerous examples of proof in recent days. On Friday, junior Minister Chloe Smith announced the Tory Government was going to strip the independent Electoral Commission of its power to take corrupt politicians to court. The move will prevent the electoral watchdog from prosecuting politicians and parties over secret donations and illegal campaigning methods.<\/p> <p>The reason behind this move is outrageously transparent: the Electoral Commission is interfering with the ability of Tory politicians to game the political system. The Electoral Commission had the temerity to expose illegal money laundering by the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum. Now it is investigating the Prime Minister over the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat that he shares with Carrie Symonds. In the new British banana republic, such independent regulation of the political class cannot be tolerated.<\/p> <p>The rot has also spread to the police. Last week, the London Metropolitan force was branded as institutionally corrupt by an independent panel tasked with investigating the axe murder of private detective Daniel Morgan, back in 1987. The eight-year inquiry, ordered by Theresa May when she was home secretary and costing \u00a316 million, found the original murder investigation was riddled with mistakes and dogged by corruption \u2013 which the Met attempted to hide.<\/p> <p>Met Commissioner Cressida Dick (above) \u2013 the highest-ranking police officer in the UK \u2013 was among the senior officers accused of placing \u201churdles\u201d in the way of the probe, leading to the accusation that the force is corrupt as an institution.<\/p> <p>This is the same Met that launched a heavy-handed attack on female protesters attending a legal vigil to mark the murder of Sarah Everard, last March. A serving Met officer has pleaded guilty to Everard\u2019s kidnapping and rape.<\/p> <p>The Met is a past master at covering its tracks. For instance, in 2009 it hired former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis as its media adviser and paid him \u00a324,000 per annum for his two-days-per-week consultancy. To the Met\u2019s embarrassment, Wallis was subsequently prosecuted (though found not guilty) on phone-hacking charges.<\/p> <p>The reason the Met stays unreformed is that it is ultimately responsible to the home secretary. And successive home secretaries need the compliance of the Met high command in order to run their continuous political campaigns against scapegoats such as immigrants, black people and the Muslim community.<\/p> <p>The institutional corruption in the Met goes all the way to the office of the home secretary. The politician now directly overseeing the force is Kit Malthouse MP, Minister of State at the Home Office. Malthouse has form. He served as deputy mayor for policing during Boris Johnson\u2019s time as London mayor. As Boris\u2019s link with the Met, Malthouse came under fire for claiming that too many police resources were being allocated to the investigation into \u2026 er, press phone hacking.<\/p> <p>In Scotland, we should not think we are free of the stench of decay in British legal institutions. I need to explain this because there is a view north of the Border that all we need to do to create a modern, democratic state is cut the ties with Westminster. Not so. Scottish legal institutions are as much in need of root-and-branch reform as in the rest of the UK. Since 1707, Scotland has been run for the Union by a self-perpetuating oligarchy of local judges and lawyers. If this oligarchy has recently started to cut loose from the Union, it is only to save its own political skin.<\/p> <p>The 1998 Scotland Act in theory put the Scottish legal system under Holyrood but in practice left the new, devolved Scottish political system at the mercy of the old Scots legal oligarchy. And no wonder.<\/p> <p>THE legal architects of the 1998 legislation were Scottish-trained lawyers such as Donald Dewar and Derry Irvine. Devolution was engineered to protect the power of the Scots judicial class, with the unelected Lord Advocate and Solicitor General sitting in Cabinet and the Holyrood chamber.<\/p> <p>As the power of the UK state wanes, the Scottish legal oligarchy has been flexing its own political muscles \u2013 and not always for the good. One result was the now-admitted malicious prosecution by the Crown of David Whitehouse and Paul Clark, the administrators appointed to oversee Rangers when the club went into administration in 2012. Subsequent litigation could cost the Scottish taxpayer upwards of \u00a3100m.<\/p> <p>Then there is the fall-out from the failed prosecution of Alex Salmond on various sex charges. For obvious reasons I will be careful what I say here. But we need to note the arrest and subsequent prosecution of respected journalist Mark Hirst, allegedly for \u201cacting in a threatening or abusive manner\u201d as a result of a YouTube video he posted about the trial.<\/p> <p>Hirst had his electronic equipment impounded by Police Scotland. However, when he came to trial, the judge summarily dismissed the case. I would hazard that the baseless prosecution of journalists is a scandal \u2013 wherever it takes place.<\/p> <p>Then there is the successful prosecution of former British ambassador Craig Murray, for contempt of court resulting from his blog coverage of the Salmond trial. Murray has been sentenced to eight months in prison by Lady Leeona Dorrian, who also oversaw the Salmond trial. Murray (below) intends to appeal his conviction to the UK Supreme Court. The essence of the case against Murray is that it is possible to identify the anonymous complainants in the Salmond trial by \u201cjigsawing\u201d his reports.<\/p> <p>As far as I can determine, no mainstream journalist has been jailed for contempt for 40 years \u2013 fines are the modern norm. So Murray\u2019s jailing \u2013 right or wrong - is a landmark legal event concerning the rights of journalists. Except that Lady Dorrian\u2019s judgment queries whether Murray is in fact a journalist. She argues that mainstream media (a vague term surely) are \u201cregulated\u201d but bloggers are not. Hence the need for an exemplary sentence.<\/p> <p>Leave aside whether Murray is guilty. In fact, I found it instantly easy to identify some of the complainants from mainstream broadcast and print reports, which raises the question why the Crown did not pursue other journalists for contempt. Perhaps because putting \u201cmainstream\u201d journos in jail would be too embarrassing politically?<\/p> <p>The point here is that the state has chosen to pick on a blogger. Actually, a responsible, well-meaning blogger at that.<\/p> <p>These developments concern me. First, the Scots judiciary is seeking to expand its powers. Lady Dorrian oversaw a group which is looking to pilot trial by judge and not jury in sex cases.<\/p> <p>Secondly, it is not up to the judiciary to define a hierarchy of what is, or is not, \u201cmainstream\u201d journalism. If this were a decision of a court in eastern Europe, the Scottish liberal centre would be up in arms. As it is, because of the opprobrium surrounding the Salmond case, a major contraction of free speech has been perpetrated by the Scottish judiciary \u2013 with hardly a splutter from the liberal media.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"31N9JPQXIRXARKLAHUW42VK9EU7HN2"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1077,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Scotland","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mark Hirst","victim_keywords":"detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Craig Murray","victim_keywords":"detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"Scotland","region":"None","country":"United Kingdom","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Mark Hirst","victim_keywords":"detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Craig Murray","victim_keywords":"detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1023719162,"Input.title":"Grim torture images ignite anger against Ugandan police","Input.publish_date":"2017-05-13 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Al jazeera \u2014 Ugandan rights activists say grisly images of the torture of a detained politician showing septic wounds on his body highlight escalating brutality and impunity by the country\u2019s security personnel.<\/p> <p>Pictures began circulating online and in local media on Thursday of Geoffrey Byamukama, mayor of a small town in western Uganda, lying on a hospital bed with gaping wounds on his swollen knees and ankles, and bruises elsewhere on his body.<\/p> <p>Eric Rugira \u2013 a friend of Byamukama who visited him in the hospital where he is being treated and held \u2013 said Byamukama had told him the wounds came from \u201chours of torture\u201d at the hands of police shortly after his arrest.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe is in a terrible shape,\u201d Rugira said.<\/p> <p>The images of Byamukama have elicited widespread anger and denunciation from Ugandans on social media.

If there is any reason why they came there at all, that reason must have been a public information. You don\u2019t plan anything untoward and then give a public notice to that effect.<\/p> <p>\u201cTherefore, if Nigerians have agreed to meet at the national secretariat of CDHR that has consistently played the same role even under the military for 30 years, I do not see any justification for this and we are going to find out exactly why our office was condoned off this morning as early as 6am and they are still there. I will put a call across to the commissioner of police as to why such action was taken or necessary.\u201d<\/p> <p>He said there was no justification for condoning off or restricting people from accessing their legitimate place of business.<\/p> <p>Advertisements<\/p> <p>\u201cThe condoning off of the Sahara Reporters building is a bit excessive. Whatever it is that they have by way of their beat as security operatives, it cannot justify the violation of the rights of Nigerians to have free access to their legitimate business area.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cRemember that the national secretariat of CDHR also has other companies and concerns housed in the same building. It is a huge building, so why not invite the leadership of the organisation, why will you seal off the place and make a mockery of yourself?<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople who are issuing notices to have meetings are terrorised, those who are in the bush terrorising the country are now being paid in the form of amnesty. It is a big contradiction. These are vestiges of the state we have long passed where the military is riding roughshod on our rights, we won\u2019t take it.<\/p> <p>\u201cTo what extent will you justify sealing up a business premise? Omoyele Sowore is not Sahara Reporters. Sahara Reporters is a business concern, an entity that is a corporate legal establishment. Sowore might be a director there but he is not Sahara Reporters.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey should give us the reason for their actions because this is reminiscent of the military period. We have never had it this chaotic since that period and I believe it is condemnable and unacceptable and they need to apologise for their actions, otherwise we will all hear from ourselves one way or the other.\u201d<\/p> <p>Speaking on the siege, Olaseni Ajayi, co-covener of Coalition for Revolution (CORE), said the actions confirmed that the rights of Nigerians are no longer guaranteed under this dispensation.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe right to speech, associate, protest and even to think are no more guaranteed under this neo- regime. It is crude and confirms everything we have been saying about this regime and the situation in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>\u201cHowever, our agitation for the immediate release of Omoyele Sowore, Agba Jalingo, Abayomi Olawale (Mandate) and all others currently being held in Buhari detention centres, and for the revolutionary transformation of the country continues.\u201d<\/p> <p>SERAP condemns Siege<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has called on the federal government to lift the siege.<\/p> <p>READ ALSO:<\/p> <p>In a statement released by its deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the group said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s authorities should immediately lift the siege to the offices of Sahara Reporters and Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), end the illegality and allow journalists, activists and civil society to operate freely.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cNigeria\u2019s security agents and state governors should also immediately stop the nationwide campaign of arbitrary arrests against journalists, activists and protesters. The attack on Sahara Reporters and CDHR is coming on the heels of staggering crackdown on critics, journalists and activists by many state governors.\u201d<\/p> <p>The group said the government is increasingly targeting journalists, critics and activists, stating that it is an obvious attempt to silence investigative journalism.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe federal authorities and many state governors are targeting journalists, critics and activists, in clear violation of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution of 1999 (as amended), and international obligations, as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to requiring the authorities to respect fundamental rights and the rules of law.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese attacks are clearly aimed at silencing the kind of journalism and investigative reporting that makes federal and state governments uncomfortable.

The previous month, he had been convicted of \u201cinciting subversion of state power\u201d for writing articles about human rights and democracy. This wasn\u2019t Chen\u2019s first time in jail. He\u2019d already spent a total of 13 years in prison, including three for participating in the 1989 pro-democracy movement. So to some extent, he was prepared for what lay ahead. But this prison term would be different.<\/p> <p>Within a month, he had contracted frostbite on his hands after prison guards refused to give him warm clothes and blankets during the unusually cold winter. After two years, Chen began to suffer from chronic enteritis, a treatable inflammation of the digestive tract normally caused by contaminated food or drink. But Chen didn\u2019t receive treatment. In December 2013 he began to have frequent bouts of severe diarrhea. When his wife visited him in mid-2014, he was extremely weak due to dehydration and fever, had lost a considerable amount of weight, and was in a poor mental state. By December of that year, Chen was psychologically distressed. By then, he had been suffering from untreated diarrhea for a year and had been repeatedly placed in solitary confinement. The prison has refused to grant him medical parole and reportedly told Chen\u2019s wife it never would, despite its inability or unwillingness to treat him.<\/p> <p>Viewpoint China\u2019s \u2018New Achievements\u2019 in Legal Reform Exist More in Policy than in Practice Stanley Lubman It is no coincidence that two days after Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death, Xinhua published an article praising China\u2019s \u201cnew achievements in judicial protection of human rights.\u201d The judicial reforms the article mentions have not yet been fully implemented and...<\/p> <p>Disturbingly, Chen\u2019s case is not an outlier. Dozens of political detainees and prisoners have reported being deprived of adequate medical treatment. These cases raise the question of what kind of treatment Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo received before his death in July 2017 due to complications from liver cancer. Chinese security agents and propaganda officials went into overdrive before and after his death, attempting to paint a picture that Liu received the best available medical care. However, during Liu\u2019s seven years at Jinzhou Prison in Liaoning Province, authorities knew that Liu had hepatitis B, a disease that put him at greater risk for liver cancer. Yet, Liu\u2019s cancer was so advanced when he was granted medical parole and moved to a hospital that no surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy could be performed, according to his wife, the poet Liu Xia.<\/p> <p>Chinese law mandates that prisoners and individuals held in detention facilities receive prompt medical care; however, the reality is often far removed from the law. Deliberately depriving prisoners of medical care is a life-threatening form of torture, and appears to be commonly used against political prisoners on China. Many of these cases follow a similar pattern, starting with a decline in health from existing conditions or new injuries emerging due to torture or ill-treatment, denied access to adequate and prompt medical care, and a refusal to approve applications for medical bail or parole. Family members worry that the government will simply let their loved ones die behind bars; the death of China\u2019s most famous political prisoner in police custody only strengthens that fear.<\/p> <p>Another pressing case of deprived medical treatment is that of rural women\u2019s rights activist Su Changlan. Su was detained in 2014 after posting social media messages in support of the Occupy Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Authorities in Guangdong\u2019s Foshan City arrested and charged Su with \u201cinciting subversion of state power,\u201d accusing her of trying to \u201coverthrow the socialist system\u201d with her articles and comments on WeChat. Su suffers from hyperthyroidism, which can be fatal if not treated. In custody, she has suffered from complications from a lack of treatment, including heart arrhythmia, trembling hands, swollen eyes, weight loss, and incontinence. Su told her lawyers in meetings throughout 2015 and 2016 about the poor or non-existent medical care she had been receiving, as well as the poor hygiene and living conditions.<\/p> <p>Conversation Liu Xiaobo, 1955-2017 Perry Link, Thomas Kellogg & more When news this morning reached us that Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo had died, we invited all past contributors to the ChinaFile Conversation to reflect on his life and on his death. Liu died, still in state-custody, eight years into his 11-...<\/p> <p>For more than two years, authorities repeatedly denied her lawyers\u2019 applications to secure her release on medical bail. In March 2017, Su was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. Su\u2019s health continued to dangerously deteriorate after her conviction, and she now reportedly suffers from possible kidney failure and is having difficulty speaking. Her husband, who visited her on June 2017\u2014the first time that officials allowed him such a visit\u2014told journalists, \u201cHer health is much, much worse than it was before.\u201d Su\u2019s family fears her life is in danger and she won\u2019t receive better treatment until she is released in October 2017.<\/p> <p>The risk of death from deprived medical care is very real. On March 14, 2014, human rights activist Cao Shunli died after being deprived of medical treatment for over six months in a Beijing detention center. Police seized Cao, who had several manageable health conditions, in September 2013 to prevent her from traveling to Geneva to testify to the U.N. Human Rights Council about the human rights situation in China. Cao had a liver condition that she had managed in the past, but guards reportedly confiscated medication that she had with her. While Cao was held in a detention center, her health began to deteriorate, but authorities refused to approve her lawyers\u2019 requests for medical bail. It was not until she was practically in a coma that bail was approved, and Cao died from organ failure only 22 days later. Other individuals who challenged the government and have died after being deprived of medical care in custody include petitioner-activists Chen Xiaoming and Duan Huimin in the mid-2000s, and more recently Tibetans Goshul Lobsang and Tenzin Delek Rinpoche.<\/p> <p>The international community has spoken out about deprivation of medical treatment as a form of torture used against China\u2019s political prisoners. U.N. human rights experts, in calling on China to provide adequate medical care for activist Guo Feixiong in August 2016, felt that, \u201cHis public profile as a human rights defender seems to have been the cause and aggravating factor for the denial of appropriate medical care and ill-treatment.\u201d<\/p> <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to \u201cgovern the country according to the law,\u201d but the pattern of deprived medical care shows a disregard for the lives of human rights defenders and a lack of rule of law. Legislation requiring \u201cprompt medical treatment\u201d are not implemented, and other regulations and rules are deficient because they don\u2019t contain legal guarantees that doctors in prisons or detention facilities can make independent medical decisions without interference from either law-enforcement or Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) officials.<\/p> <p>The NYRB China Archive China: A Life in Detention Yang Zhanqing from New York Review of Books Every year in China, thousands of people suffer what the United Nations calls \u201carbitrary detention\u201d: confinement in extra-legal facilities\u2014including former government buildings, hotels, or mental hospitals\u2014which are sometimes known as \u201cblack jails...<\/p> <p>Under the Regulations on Detention Facilities, detainees are only guaranteed a medical examination upon entering the detention facility. A request for treatment outside the facility must be approved by the head of the detention center, allowing for arbitrary decision-making in \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d cases. The new draft Detention Center Law doesn\u2019t contain any new language that would ensure prompt, impartial, and comprehensive medical treatment, exposing the government\u2019s failure to act to end this disturbing trend. Though prisoners receive periodic medical checks, in practice exams are only required to be done once a year, and they may not be comprehensive or timely enough to detect health problems.<\/p> <p>Securing release for medical reasons is also difficult. China\u2019s Criminal Procedure Law allows for detainees and prisoners to receive medical bail or parole due to \u201cserious illness.\u201d However, the scope of what constitutes \u201cserious illness\u201d under detailed measures released in 2014 is extremely restrictive and requires some prisoners to endure six months of failed treatment before they can be eligible. Some Chinese lawyers who take on \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d cases have reported that C.C.P. bodies, not medical professionals, must approve applications for medical release.<\/p> <p>China has obligations under international law to ensure prisoners and detainees have access to prompt and adequate medical care, including seeing a doctor of their choice. Since 1988, China has been party to the Convention Against Torture, which bans torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. In December 2015, the U.N. Committee Against Torture raised concern over deaths in Chinese custody as a result of a lack of prompt medical care. A year prior, two other U.N. committees, on economic, social, and cultural rights and on women\u2019s rights, called on China to ensure women in detention and human rights activists are provided with adequate health care in all circumstances, in respect of China\u2019s treaty obligations.<\/p> <p>China\u2019s fellow members on the U.N. Human Rights Council should pressure the government to cooperate with the Council\u2019s own independent human rights experts, who have highlighted concerns over the deprivation of medical care to human rights defenders. Such experts should be allowed, as some have in the past, to independently visit China\u2019s prisons and detention centers to report on the standard and care of medical treatment. Other governments can and should continue to forcefully and publicly call on China to abide by its international obligations on torture and human rights. China\u2019s respect for its responsibilities under international law is a matter of global concern.<\/p> <p>As Dostoevsky famously wrote, \u201cThe degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.\u201d In China, as seen in the cases of Chen Xi, Su Changlan, Cao Shunli, and so many others, the government refuses to behave in a civilized manner when it tortures prisoners of conscience by depriving them access to adequate medical treatment.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"351S7I5UGBB6IQG05UZPE80ORPIJNM"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1454,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2012","month":"01","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chen Xi","victim_keywords":"activist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Su Changlan","victim_keywords":"activist, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Cao Shunli","victim_keywords":"activist, deprived, die","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2012","month":"01","date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Chen Xi","victim_keywords":"activist","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Su Changlan","victim_keywords":"activist, detained","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Cao Shunli","victim_keywords":"activist, deprived, die","victim_type":["human rights defender"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1040401905,"Input.title":"Rwandan court jails Chinese man for beating men tied on tree","Input.publish_date":"2022-04-20 16:32:23","Input.article_interface":"<p>\u2013 \u2013<\/p> <p>A Chinese man has been jailed for twenty years for beating his employees while they were tied to a tree in Rwanda.<\/p> <p>Sun Shujun was sentenced by a Rwandan court after he was put on trial for torture for his action which was captured on video.<\/p> <p>He was arrested after the video of his action went viral.

He headed the feared Haqqani network that is blamed for many deadly attacks and kidnappings.<\/p> <p>The announcement came hours after Taliban fired their guns into the air to disperse protesters in the capital of Kabul and arrested several journalists, the second time in less than a week that heavy-handed tactics were used to break up a demonstration.<\/p> <p>Drawn mostly from Afghanistan\u2019s dominant Pashtun ethnic group, the Cabinet's lack of representation from other ethnic groups also seems certain to hobble its support from abroad.<\/p> <p>Stay informed about local news and weather in the D.C. area.

Near daily flights from Qatar bring in humanitarian aid, but the needs are massive, and the Taliban can hardly afford isolation.<\/p> <p>In announcing the Cabinet, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid emphasized that the appointments were temporary. He did not say how long they would serve and what would be the catalyst for a change.<\/p> <p>Since taking over Afghanistan in mid-August after U.S. troops withdrew, the Taliban have shown no indications they will hold elections.<\/p> <p>The interim prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, also headed the Taliban government in Kabul during the last years of its rule. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who had led talks with the U.S. and signed the deal that led to the withdrawal, will be one of two deputies to Akhund.<\/p> <p>A policy statement accompanying the Cabinet announcement sought to allay fears of Afghanistan's neighbors and the rest of the world, but was unlikely to calm the fears of women, who didn't get a single post.<\/p> <p>\u201cOur message to our neighbors, the region and the world is that Afghanistan's soil will not be used against the security of any other country,\u201d the statement said.<\/p> <p>It urged foreign diplomats, embassies, consulates and humanitarian organizations to return to Afghanistan. \u201cTheir presence is the need of our country,\u201d it said.<\/p> <p>The statement spoke of protecting the rights of minorities and the underprivileged, and it promised education \u201cto all countrymen within the framework of Sharia.\u201d Women were not mentioned in the three-page statement.<\/p> <p>Abdul Salam Hanafi, an ethnic Uzbek, was named as second deputy to Hasan Akhund. A long-time Taliban member, he is unlikely to satisfy demands for inclusivity and minority representation.<\/p> <p>ISIS-K is a terror group behind the bombing that killed more than 100 people at an airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. Many of its members were recently released from jails as Taliban fighters took over the country. But the groups have their differences from the Taliban too - NBC News Tehran Bureau Chief Ali Arouzi explains.<\/p> <p>Besides Haqqani as head of the police, the other top security post of defense minister went to Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob , the son of Taliban founder and near mythic figure Mullah Mohammad Omar.<\/p> <p>The Haqqani network, which dominates most of eastern Afghanistan, has been blamed for dramatic attacks in Kabul in the past two decades and for orchestrating kidnappings, often of Americans. Washington believes it still holds Mark Frerichs, a civilian contractor, who was abducted in January 2020 and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.<\/p> <p>The new foreign minister will be Amir Khan Muttaqi, another prominent figure from the Taliban's last time in power. He faces a difficult task, given the Cabinet's lack of diversity.<\/p> <p>The Cabinet selection defied the many voices that had urged inclusivity and moderation. Instead, it seemed to be a bow to the Taliban's tens of thousands of fighters, who would have struggled to accept figures from previous governments that they see as corrupt and that they believe they were called upon to oust.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe fighters made the sacrifices. ... They are the decision makers, not the politicians,\u201d said analyst and author Fazelminallah Qazizai, who has has written extensively about the Taliban.<\/p> <p>Yet even with a Cabinet dominated by ethnic Pashtuns, the Taliban\u2019s fighting force would appear to have already attained some diversity, with their ranks bolstered considerably by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks. That may have helped hand the Taliban a surprising win in the mostly Tajik province of Badakhshan, which they overran with hardly a fight. When they last ruled, the province was the only one they failed to control.<\/p> <p>In 2017, there were 10 times as many girls going to school in Afghanistan compared to 2003 - when it was about 3% of the nation's girls. With the Taliban taking over, teacher Jaala Shaw fears for students and doesn't want them to fall behind in their education.<\/p> <p>At Tuesday's demonstration that was broken up by gunfire, protesters had gathered outside the Pakistani Embassy to accuse Islamabad of aiding the Taliban's assault on northern Panjshir province. The Taliban said Monday they seized the province \u2014 the last one not in their control \u2014 after their lightning advance through Afghanistan last month.<\/p> <p>Afghanistan's previous government routinely accused neighboring Pakistan of aiding the Taliban, a charge Islamabad has denied.<\/p> <p>Dozens of women were among the protesters, and some carried signs bemoaning the killing of their sons by Taliban fighters that they say were aided by Pakistan. One sign read: \u201cI am a mother. When you kill my son, you kill a part of me.\u201d<\/p> <p>At one point, a Taliban fighter responded: \"We have announced amnesty to everyone who has killed our sons.\"<\/p> <p>The Taliban moved quickly and harshly to end the protest as demonstrators arrived near the presidential palace. They fired their weapons into the air and arrested several journalists covering the demonstration. At one point, a Taliban member waving a Kalashnikov rifle took a microphone from a journalist and began beating him with it. The journalist was later handcuffed and detained for several hours.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis is the third time I have been beaten by the Taliban covering protests,\u201d the journalist told The Associated Press, speaking on condition he not be identified because he feared retaliation. \u201cI won\u2019t go again to cover a demonstration.

He pointed out the U.S. has only 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of the world's incarcerated individuals.<\/p> <p>Chang also noted that while African Americans make up 12 percent of the population of the U.S., black American men comprise 45 percent of the prison population. In addition, Chang said the U.S. has \"political prisoners\" such as American indigenous rights activist Leonard Peltier, and former Black Panther Party member Sundiata Acoli, both of whom have been imprisoned for over 40 years.<\/p> <p>The former gangster said the U.S. preaches about human rights but \"only talks about others and forgets itself.\" Citing the Native Americans as an example, Chang said, \"How does the United States reward Indians on Thanksgiving? Massacre and encroachment on the land \u2014 a lot of land in the United States was stolen.\"<\/p> <p>He then called on the U.S. to respect the rights and interests of the people of the Ryukyu Islands.

If you are not the Republic of China police, why should I listen?\"<\/p> <p>He then threatened to report the police for treason and admonished them to \"go back and look in the mirror.\" He then growled, \"You don't dare to admit you are a citizen of the Republic of China. What gives you the right to stand here?\"<\/p> <p>Chang then issued one parting shot: \"You didn't swear to uphold the Constitution? Scum,\" before turning tail and beating a hasty retreat.

However, it was not until four years later that he was arrested and charged in 2012, then later sentenced to seven years in prison with 1,000 lashes in July 2013. Just months later, following an appeal based on charges of apostasy, or Badawi\u2019s formal abandonment of his religion, this sentence was increased to 10 years.<\/p> <p>\u201cI have the impression that his soul is being crushed, literally.

However, as he remains in Saudi imprisonment the threat of brutality lingers and Badawi has been subjected to solitary confinement, denial of essential medications, and isolation from family contacts. With a release date scheduled for 2022, Badawi\u2019s wife, Ensaf Haidar, campaigns tirelessly for his freedom from Quebec, Canada where she fled with their three children and was granted citizenship following his detainment.<\/p> <p>Speaking on the prospect of Canadian citizenship for Badawi too as the family\u2019s last hope for his early release, she told Deutsche Welle, \u201cSince me and my children are Canadian, we have the Canadian citizenship and are living here, the citizenship gives me hope in terms of a family reunification.\u201d<\/p> <p>Katsiaryna Andreyeva, Belarus<\/p> <p>Enlarge Courtesy of Igor Ilyas<\/p> <p>By: Jasmine Kerber<\/p> <p>On November 15, 2020, Belarusian journalist Katsiaryna Andreyeva streamed a live broadcast of a protest on the street below for Belsat TV.

His sentence follows years of reports criticizing the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and civilian casualties caused by Turkish airstrikes in the region.<\/p> <p>In 1994, conflict broke out between the KDP, backed by Turkey, and leftist Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), supported by Iran, which divided the Kurdish region in Iraq. The two parties have been at odds over resource allocation and Kurdistan rule. The Kurdistan\u2019s Workers Party (PKK) arose from the PUK and has called for an independent state in Turkey. The PKK has been recognized by the U.S., European Union, and other countries as a terrorist organization.<\/p> <p>\u201cSherwani was arrested on anti-state charges\u201d and for \u201callegedly violating Article 156 of the Iraqi penal Code, which states that any person who violates the independence, unity, or security of the country can be punished with life imprisonment,\u201d Ignacio Delgado Culebras, the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 (CPJ) Middle East and North Africa representative, said in a statement.<\/p> <p>The Kurdistan Region Security Council used video recordings to accuse Sherwani of spying for the PKK. Culebras claims that the CPJ found that the video is highly edited to \u201cmake pictures and bits of audio recordings taken out of context appear as conclusive evidence of their guilt.\u201d<\/p> <p>Sherwani has been arrested twice before in 2007 and 2012, the latter of which was following a piece critiquing former Kurdish President Masoud Barzani\u2019s brother. In both instances, the Kurdish authorities have denied allegations that the detainment was related to Sherwani\u2019s journalism. In an interview with CPJ Sherwani\u2019s wife, Rugesh Izzaddin Muheiadin, said Sherwani\u2019s \u201cbrother has been approached by KDP members and asked to convince Sherwan to give up journalism for good.\u201d<\/p> <p>Culebras also wrote that Karwan Gaznay, a member of Kurdistan\u2019s parliament, \u201cwho attended the trial concluded that none of the evidence produced proved that Sherwani was guilty of the charges filed against him.\u201d During his detention, Sherwani was threatened with the rape of his wife, according to a Facebook post by Gaznay that shared details of the trial.<\/p> <p>An appeals court decided on April 28 to uphold the six-year sentence. Dindar Zebari, the Kurdistan Regional Government\u2019s international advocacy coordinator, did not respond to a request for comment.<\/p> <p>Abdurahman Abey, China<\/p> <p>By Eric Ting<\/p> <p>Abdurahman Abey, a senior Uighur publisher, was arrested by the Chinese Communist Party in July 2018 after being accused of \u201cseparatism and religious extremism activities,\u201d according to Radio Free Asia.<\/p> <p>Abey is a CCP official himself, and had a 40-year career as a publisher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, serving as the CCP\u2019s deputy secretary of the Xinjiang People\u2019s Publishing House. Per Radio Free Asia, he won awards \u201cevery year\u201d between 2003 and 2013.<\/p> <p>Radio Free Asia reports that Abey first came under CCP scrutiny in 2015, and was questioned regularly by various agencies. He was detained in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In recent years, the Chinese government has sought to crack down on \u201ctwo-faced Uighur\u201d thought leaders they accuse of harboring \u201cstrong religious views\u201d and \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d teachings.<\/p> <p>Yuki Kitazumi, Myanmar<\/p> <p>By: Thomas Manglona<\/p> <p>Japanese journalist Yuki Kitazumi, 45, was arrested by Myanmar\u2019s military junta at his home on April 18, released by security forces on May 13, and deported to Japan shortly after. Myanmar authorities say it was for the sake of maintaining its relations between the two countries. He was arrested on the suspicion of disseminating \u201cfake news.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cI wanted to report on what was going on in Yangon, but I\u2019m frustrated about not being able to do it,\u201d Kitazumi, told reporters upon arriving at the Narita International airport, according to Japan Today. \u201cThere are lots of things that people in Myanmar asked me to convey to the world.\u201d<\/p> <p>Kitazumi reported on the protests in Myanmar for Japanese news outlets. He previously reported for Nikkei business daily in Tokyo. He could have faced a jail term for as long as three years if convicted under a Myanmar penal code that criminalizes \u201cfake news.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists along with other media organizations had called for his immediate release along with the 40 imprisoned journalists they found in preliminary investigations.<\/p> <p>Esraa Abdelfattah, Egypt<\/p> <p>By: Phoebe Quinton<\/p> <p>Esraa Abdelfattah was abducted by plainclothes police officers on her way home from the movies on October 12, 2019. After being car chased and forcibly taken to an unknown location, Abdelfattah was tortured to unlock her phone and access her contacts. The police left her facing a wall for over seven hours, blindfolded and handcuffed, then beat her. When this failed, they suffocated her and strangled her with the jacket she was wearing. With her contact information, several more journalists were detained including Mohammed Salah and Solafa Magdy, with whom she went to the movies.<\/p> <p>Abdelfattah was arrested for joining a terrorist organization and spreading misinformation through social media. She is an avid human rights defender and activist as founder of the \u201cFree Egyptian Women Group,\u201d co-founder the April 6 Movement for workers\u2019 rights, project manager at the Egyptian Democratic Academy, and journalist at al-Tahrir newspaper.<\/p> <p>She has been imprisoned, without a sentence, for over a year and a half. Every 45 days, the police renew her detention. In response to the abuse, Abdelfattah has gone on hunger strikes on and off during her imprisonment. On Aug. 23, 2020, she was transferred to the prison hospital after having a nervous breakdown and almost losing consciousness. She is still captive in Al-Qanatir Prison in Cairo.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3W31J70BAUBI26PRYPQNZC6P77XKCR"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1243,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state

In 2018, He Qian alleged that Deng Fei groped her while she was a 21-year-old intern and he was chief reporter for Phoenix Weekly. Deng then sued He for defamation. A Hangzhou court concurred with Deng, ordering He Qian and Zou Sicong, who published her accusations on his website, to pay Deng $1,813 in damages. Her case bears obvious similarities to that of prominent #MeToo activist Xianzi, who last month appeared in court to press sexual harassment charges against CCTV anchor Zhu Jun. Public awareness surrounding gender violence rose sharply in 2020, especially after pop star Tan Weiwei released her single \u201cXiao Juan (Pseudonym),\u201d which documented a litany of violent (and often unprosecuted) crimes perpetrated against women. For The Associated Press, Huizhong Wu reported on He Qian\u2019s plight, and the difficulty victims of sexual assault have proving their case in court:<\/p> <p>A court in the eastern city of Hangzhou ruled Tuesday that the evidence provided by Zou Sicong and He Qian against prominent journalist Deng Fei was \u201cnot enough to allow someone to firmly believe without any hesitation that what was described truly happened.\u201d [\u2026] Throughout the process, Zou and He said they faced a higher burden of proof under Chinese law. Although China allowed sexual misconduct as a ground for lawsuits in 2019, the definition of such harassment remains murky and very few cases are filed. Many have been prosecuted in courts as labor disputes or under laws to protect public reputations. [\u2026] \u201cThis is equal to telling someone who was humiliated, who was hurt, that if you don\u2019t have audio recordings or videos of the event, then you better hurry up and shut your mouth,\u201d Zou\u2019s and He\u2019s lawyer, Xu Kai, said in a statement. \u201cThe court had imposed the entire burden of proof on Zou Sicong and He Qian.\u201d [\u2026] Zhou Xiaoxuan [also known as Xianzi], the face of one of China\u2019s most high-profile #MeToo cases, said she did not see the ruling as a defeat. \u201cIt was very brave then for He Qian to speak out about this with her real name. She did this for the rights of other women.\u201d [Source]<\/p> <p>At The New York Times, Javier C. Hern\u00e1ndez interviewed He Qian and Zou Sicong, the two defendants:<\/p> <p>\u201cChinese law needs to do more to respond to #MeToo,\u201d Ms. He, who also uses the first name Belinda, said in an interview. \u201cThis is only the beginning and far from enough.\u201d [\u2026] Mr. Zou said Chinese law should be more responsive to women who bring forward allegations of assault and harassment. \u201cHoping a topic will just disappear and return to the old world is ignorant and peremptory,\u201d he wrote on WeChat, a popular social media app. \u201cI will take responsibility until the end for publishing the article about He Qian.\u201d [\u2026] Feng Yuan, a co-founder of a women\u2019s rights nonprofit group in Beijing, said the court had \u201ccompletely denied the existence of sexual harassment.\u201d \u201cMany people will feel even more powerless in the face of sexual harassment,\u201d Ms. Feng said. [Source]<\/p> <p>He Qian is one of the victims accused of reputation infringement since 2018. Her loss once again shows how cruel the legal system is to victims of sexual assault. Insiders said that Deng Fei, the alleged rapist, has been using his personal relationships to prevent media coverage. https:\/\/t.co\/QgAUcxMQsT \u2014 FreeChineseFeminists (@FeministChina) January 7, 2021<\/p> <p>In the aftermath of Xianzi\u2019s December trial, The Economist wrote about the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s fraught relationship with feminist activists, who the Party views as potentially subversive:<\/p> <p>Many aspects of the system in China are heavily skewed in favour of men, not least in employment and family matters. The World Economic Forum places China above South Korea and Japan in its ranking of countries by gender equality. But since Xi Jinping became China\u2019s leader in 2012 his country has fallen from 69th to 106th on that list, below Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Despite this, more women than ever in China are gaining degrees. In 2009, for the first time, the number of female undergraduates surpassed those who were male. Since then women have retained this majority. Young highly educated women have been at the forefront of China\u2019s #MeToo movement. Their demands for rights as women are \u201cvery difficult to suppress\u201d, says Wang Zheng of the University of Michigan. The Communist Party accuses \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d of stoking such advocacy. In 2015 police arrested a group of women merely for planning to hand out stickers about sexual harassment on public transport. The \u201cfeminist five\u201d, as they became known, were released only after weeks in prison, and after news of their plight had sparked outrage in China and abroad. When visiting the state-backed All-China Women\u2019s Federation in 2018, President Xi said the organisation \u201cabsolutely must not become one of those organisations like they have in other countries for feminists or posh women\u201d. Though stifled by the government, campaigning has made some impact. \u201cPrior to #MeToo, discussions about women and gender in mainstream media and on social media were quite limited,\u201d says Zhang Zhiqi, the host of a podcast popular among feminists in China. \u201cThere\u2019s now a lot more awareness about gender equality and I think that\u2019s due to #MeToo.\u201d [Source]<\/p> <p>At ChinaFile, Shen Lu investigated the glaring gender disparities in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ranks, which belie the Party\u2019s own claims to upholding gender equality:<\/p> <p>According to the state-sponsored All-China Women\u2019s Federation, women comprise 37.5 percent of the 4 million members of the Party\u2019s neighborhood and village committees, which enforce Party mandates and maintain social order. But, the higher women move up the rungs of government hierarchy, the fewer their female peers. Less than 9 percent of Party secretaries and heads of local governments at the provincial, municipal, and county levels are women. At the county level, women make up 9.33 percent of leadership, 5.29 percent at the city-level, and 3.23 percent at the provincial level. [\u2026] This data was last updated in 2017. [\u2026] Women don\u2019t enjoy equal representation in the Party\u2019s rank and file, either. As of 2018, they made up 27 percent of China\u2019s 90 million Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. [\u2026] But while Chinese women\u2019s overall political representation has improved over the years, women still barely appear in positions of government and Party leadership, and seldom rise above the rank of deputy, according to data from the All-China Women\u2019s Federation and National Bureau of Statistics. Currently, out of China\u2019s 31 provincial governors, only two are women. In November, Shen Yiqin was promoted to Party secretary of Guizhou province, becoming China\u2019s sole female provincial Party secretary, a position that is \u201cthe most important stepping stone to a Politburo seat,\u201d according to Cheng Li, director of The Brookings Institution\u2019s China Center. The two female provincial governors and one Party secretary make 4.84 percent of all governors and secretaries, an improvement from just the two governors, or 3.23 percent, in 2017. [\u2026] Indeed, data compiled by the international affairs scholars David Bulman and Kyle Jaros on the tenures and backgrounds of Provincial Party Standing Committee (PPSC) members between 1996 and 2017 show that female cadres disproportionately headed entities such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (41 percent) and United Front Work Department (26 percent). \u201cThese assignments imply that the Party perceives female cadre comparative advantage through traditionally gendered lenses: Female cadres are effective communicators and dialogue facilitators rather than leaders in their own right,\u201d Bulman says. By contrast, women are underrepresented in functional departments where ultimate power resides. While 7.5 percent of all PPSC members were female, only 0.7 percent of Party secretaries and 6.2 percent of deputy Party secretaries were women, during those 21 years.

[\u2026] On Sunday, a group calling itself a defender of men\u2019s rights began an online campaign aimed at getting the attention of government censors. It offered a sample letter to send to China\u2019s media regulator accusing Ms. Yang of \u201cinsulting all men\u201d and \u201cpropagating hatred.\u201d The post was later deleted amid criticism. [\u2026] Ms. Yang responded to some of her male critics in a special routine last week, saying, \u201cThey think I\u2019m the most abominable witch in the world. Everything they\u2019ve suffered is because I said, \u2018How can you look so average and be so confident?\u2019\u201d [\u2026] In her show last week, Ms. Yang said that her supporters outnumbered her critics. \u201cA joke can only get laughs for one reason,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it resonates.\u201d [Source]<\/p> <p>The Economist also covered Yang\u2019s taboo-breaking success on the comedy show \u201cRock and Roast\u201d, and the backlash led by a patriarchal establishment unwilling to share the stage:<\/p> <p>Long the stars of Chinese joke-making, men are unhappy about being the butt of it. Chizi, a popular male contestant on \u201cRock and Roast\u201d with a penchant for boorish jokes about women, sniffed that Ms Yang was \u201cnot performing comedy\u201d. Guo Degang, a master of xiangsheng, a witty and often bawdy form of traditional comedy involving banter between two people, recently said he would not recruit women for his troupe (\u201cout of respect\u201d, he said). Very few women perform xiangsheng. [\u2026] The show, which began in 2017, has been a boost for Chinese stand-up and female participation in it. Evangeline Z says the form of comedy is \u201chuge\u201d in Shanghai. And she reckons up to half of the city\u2019s 50-odd weekly performances are by women. But male and female comics alike warn spectators that what they are about to say could be offensive and they should not take offence. Xiao Ju, a 22-year-old part-time comedian, also in Shanghai, says that showgoers expect to come in for \u201ca bit of easy laughter\u201d, so are ruffled when the ribbing reveals something about themselves. Female comedians elicit stronger reactions from the audience than male ones, says Xiao Ju. Many people are still shocked when women swear on stage. A gag about a prostitute told by a male comic draws tuts if delivered by a woman. \u201cSex is a perilous topic,\u201d says Xiao Ju. \u201cSo are shit, piss and farts. If a man jokes about these, everyone laughs. If a woman does, she is disgusting.\u201d For fear of offending, many stick to crowd-pleasing themes like families and jobs. [Source]<\/p> <p>Star comedian Yang Li was trending again for her new performance in which she wrapped up how roasting men had got her fame as well as hate in 2020. Not surprised at all to see so many men including Chi Zi to take offense again. Some even tip-off the authority to take her down. \u2014 Caiwei Chen (@CaiweiC) December 27, 2020<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":3,"HIT_id":"3SV8KD29L67VAZ01Q3AVAA7AGRCZK2"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":465,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2009","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Hangzhou","region":"None","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"He Qian","victim_keywords":"journalist, sexual assault, China, #MeToo, judicial ruling, defamation, Phoenix Weekly","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2009","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Hangzhou","region":"None","country":"People's Republic of China","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"He Qian","victim_keywords":"journalist, sexual assault, China, #MeToo, judicial ruling, defamation, Phoenix Weekly","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":1007276103,"Input.title":"Employees boycott lunch to protest \u2018splintering\u2019 of Ordnance Factory Board","Input.publish_date":"2021-10-02 13:34:55","Input.article_interface":"<p>A number of employees of the two defence units in Tiruchi observed Black Day on Friday by boycotting lunch in protest against \"splintering\" of the Ordnance Factory Board into seven corporations.<\/p> <p>They condemned what they termed as the \"unilateral\" decision of the Modi Government at the Centre to disintegrate the 220-year-old Indian ordnance factories into non-viable corporations.

Dozens of journalists have been assassinated in Sri Lanka, particularly in the North and the East, over the last decades by paramilitary groups.<\/p> <p>On Thursday, members of several journalist associations in Sri Lanka, including the Working Journalist Association and the FMETU, held a \u201cBlack January\u201d protest in Colombo to condemn the latest threats and commemorate all media workers killed, disappeared and physically harmed by paramilitary groups.<\/p> <p>The January 23 threats against the Batticaloa journalists are just one of several similar incidents reported this month.<\/p> <p>On January 7, Tamil Guardian reporter Selvakumar Nilanthan was summoned to Batticaloa courts after the police charged him with \u201cobstructing the duties of a government official.\u201d He was released on bail later that day and ordered to appear before the court on February 28.<\/p> <p>Nilanthan was visited several times by officers from the Eravur Police Station who behaved in a threatening manner. It is believed the police acted on a 10-month-old complaint made by N. Vilvarathnam, head of the Chenkalady Divisional Secretariat, who falsely claimed that the reporter was obstructing his duties. Nilanthan, however, was simply reporting on a protest by local residents against corruption in the divisional secretariat.<\/p> <p>On January 10, Nimanthi Ranasinghe, a court reporter for Lankadeepa, went to Mulleriyawa police station near Colombo to record a complaint about a death threat from an underworld thug. The officer in charge (OIC), however, refused to record her complaint because she refused to reveal her source of information. She has now lodged a complaint about how she was treated by the OIC.<\/p> <p>On January 19 an unidentified group vandalised the home of Jaffna-based Valampuri journalist I. Rajeskaran in Mannipay, Jaffna. The house was vandalised in December, along with a nearby home that is owned by another journalist.<\/p> <p>On January 16, a special Amnesty International report, entitled \u201cAttacks on Human Rights Organisations, Media Organisations and Journalists in Sri Lanka,\u201d noted that there had been \u201cmore than a dozen unscheduled visits to human rights and media organisations by the authorities\u201d between last year\u2019s Easter Sunday terrorist attacks and this January.<\/p> <p>Human rights and media organisation personnel, the report said, \u201cwere questioned about their activities by members of the Sri Lankan Police, including the Criminal Investigation Department and the Terrorism Investigation Division, as well as State Intelligence.\u201d<\/p> <p>In December, President Rajapakse met with corporate media heads, advising them to align their publications with his government\u2019s policies. \u201cI anticipate that all the media organisations will fulfil their duty to the country through journalism which helps to uplift the dignity of the country,\u201d he declared.<\/p> <p>Death threats, assassinations and disappearances of journalists were frequent during Rajapakse\u2019s tenure as defence secretary\u2014from 2005 to 2015\u2014when his brother Mahinda was the president.<\/p> <p>While former President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe came to power promising to expose and prosecute those responsible for the attacks on media workers, nothing changed. Police investigations into the disappearance of political analyst and cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda and the abductions and assaults of Rivira\u2019s former editor Upali Tennekoon and the Nation\u2019s deputy editor Keith Noyahr and its senior journalist Namal Perera were political delaying tactics and came to nothing.<\/p> <p>In fact, the intimidation and harassment of media workers and attacks on freedom of expression continued under the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration. This included the jailing of award-winning writer Shakthika Sathkumara and police threats against artist Malaka Devapriya. Both cases were initiated after complaints to the police by extreme-right Buddhist monks.<\/p> <p>The escalating attacks on journalists and media freedom in Sri Lanka are an international phenomenon. The sharpest expression of this is the persecution and jailing of WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange in Britain, and the moves to extradite him to US to face espionage charges.<\/p> <p>Since Rajapakse\u2019s swearing in as president, Sri Lanka\u2019s corporate media has ignored the escalating intimidation of media workers and not published a word about the death threats issued against the Batticaloa journalists. The growing coercion is part of a broader crackdown against the democratic rights of the working class as the new government, nervous about the eruption of strikes and protests, moves towards authoritarian methods of rule.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"3DQYSJDTYNQ3J48CTZB7FUEUOSEXEB"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d394f796-b546-433a-a452-733a0151fd8d","work_time_in_seconds":1654,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors with permissions","violation_types":["killing","other"],"year":"2009.0","month":"01","date":"8.0","city":"Sri Lanka","region":"None","country":"None","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Lasantha Wickrematunge","victim_keywords":"chief editor, murdered","victim_type":["journalist","journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Selvakumar Nilanthan","victim_keywords":"journalist, Tamil Guardian, threats","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Punniyamoorthy Sasikaran","victim_keywords":"journalist, Sirasa TV, threats","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Kunarasa Supojan","victim_keywords":"Shakthi tv, journalist, threats","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":5,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Nallathambi Nithyanathan","victim_keywords":"journalist, threats, Shakthi TV","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":6,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Krishnakumar","victim_keywords":"threats, the state-owned Independent Television Network","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"unknown"},{"victim_idx":7,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Vadivel Sakthivel","victim_keywords":"journalist, threats, newspaper Thinakkural","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":8,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Subramaniam Kunalingam","victim_keywords":"journalist, threats, newspaper Thinakkural","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":9,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Selvakumar Nilanthan","victim_keywords":"Tamil Guardian reporter","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":10,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Nimanthi Ranasinghe","victim_keywords":"death threat, court reporter","victim_type":[],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":11,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"I.

Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa held a closed-door meeting with company management and senior officials in his government yesterday to press for an end to the strike, including by deploying repressive state measures if necessary.<\/p> <p>Yediyurappa ordered the chief secretary in his Hindu-supremacist Bharatiya Janata Party government to \u201ctake necessary steps to restore normalcy at Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM).\u201d Chief Secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar will convene a meeting with senior officials today to announce what the \u201cnecessary steps\u201d will consist of.<\/p> <p>Auto workers at work inside a Toyota auto plant (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)<\/p> <p>In an article previewing the meeting in the Economic Times, a source familiar with the plot to smash the workers\u2019 resistance explained that the government could prosecute workers for obstructing manufacturing activity at the plant. \u201cOnce the government issues sanction for prosecution, the management would give a brief window for employees to report at work. Those who defy the government order and abstain from work will face summary dismissal,\u201d the source continued.<\/p> <p>Over 3,000 strikers at two TKM plants launched a sit-in strike November 9 over the dismissal of a union leader who had sought to convey workers\u2019 grievances over speedup to management. One day later, management locked the workers out of the sprawling 432-acre complex located about 50 kilometres from Bengaluru. TKM, which is 89 percent owned by Japanese car giant Toyota and 11 percent by Indian conglomerate Kirloskar, is demanding a 25 percent production increase to keep the Bidadi facility globally competitive. This would force autoworkers to produce 100,000 vehicles per month instead of the current target of 80,000.<\/p> <p>Three days after the strike began, management intensified its provocations by disciplining 39 workers for alleged \u201cacts of misconduct,\u201d even though the facility was closed at the time. The state government then intervened to issue a back-to-work order that requires workers to sign an undertaking accepting the increased production target and pledging not to engage in activities detrimental to the company\u2019s interests. Although the union indicated its readiness to accept the order, the strikers rejected its terms and continue to defy it. (See: \u201cToyota workers in India continue strike, defy state back-to-work order\u201d).<\/p> <p>The comments of government ministers who attended Monday\u2019s meeting made clear that they are fully on the side of the company and the corporate elite as a whole, which wants a swift end to the strike lest it trigger a broader eruption of working-class anger over miserable working conditions. \u201cThere is no way we can allow the strike to continue as it will harm the families of a number of workers as well as hurt Karnataka\u2019s image as an industry friendly state,\u201d Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar told the Economic Times .<\/p> <p>Fraudulently claiming that \u201cKarnataka is a peaceful state, and free from industrial unrest,\u201d the labour minister stressed the priority given by the BJP state government to investors\u2019 interests. \u201cChief Minister BS Yediyurappa does not want our state to acquire a negative image outside because of this strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very purpose of recent changes to labour laws was to get more investment.\u201d<\/p> <p>This is a reference to the ruthless drive of the Indian ruling elite, spearheaded by the BJP government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to compete with China as a cheap-labour platform for global corporations and investors. To this end, Modi has initiated an across-the-board onslaught on labour protections and business regulations in what he has termed a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in pro-investor reforms.<\/p> <p>Indicating that the company got everything it wanted from Monday\u2019s meeting, TKM vice chairman Vikram Kirloskar described the meeting as \u201cexcellent.\u201d<\/p> <p>The deployment of the full force of state power against the strikers enjoys the backing of the entire ruling elite. Well aware of mounting opposition among workers to glaring levels of social inequality and poverty wages, along with the authorities\u2019 criminal mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, the corporate executives and super-rich want to send a message to other sections of workers by brutally suppressing the strike. As the Karnataka Employers\u2019 Association put it in a recent letter to Yediyurappa, appealing for him to intervene to crush the \u201cillegal agitation,\u201d the Toyota strike threatens to spread and \u201cvitiate \u2026 industrial relations in the entire area.\u201d<\/p> <p>TKM employs some 6,500 workers, including 3,460 unionized assembly line workers. The remainder is made up of supervisors and office staff. The labour minister claimed that 700 workers have signed pledges to uphold company \u201cself-discipline\u201d and have returned to work based on an agreement to meet the new production targets. However, management admitted that assembly lines were operating at less than 10 percent capacity as of December 3.<\/p> <p>Speaking to the WSWS, a striking worker said, \u201cThe TKM management keep insisting on workers giving pledges before entering the plant and to this effect they sent out messages through WhatsApp and posts. Management is also now engaged in dividing tactics.\u201d These include attempts to entice workers into accepting the new production targets by offering some of them the prospect of salary increases early next year. \u201cThere is a big difference of 15,000 rupees (about $200), a sudden jump, in the salary scale,\u201d the worker explained.<\/p> <p>The employer\u2019s ability to weaken the strike through such methods is the result of the dead end into which the strikers have been led by the TKM Employees Union (TKMEU), which has isolated the Toyota workers\u2019 struggle. The Stalinist-led All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) and Centre of Indian Trade Unions, and the Joint Committee of Trade Unions (JCTU), which they politically lead, have mouthed support for the Toyota workers struggle, but have done nothing to mobilize the working class in their defence in the face of the escalating corporate-state assault.<\/p> <p>The TKM workers\u2019 strike can succeed only if it is immediately broadened to include all auto and industrial workers throughout the Bengaluru region and beyond. The workers are not only engaged in battle against a particularly ruthless employer, but the entire ruling elite and its state apparatus, which are determined to force the strikers back into the plants to work under conditions akin to slave labour to boost corporate profits. The mass mobilization of the working class in a political struggle against the ruling class\u2019s onslaught on working conditions and workers\u2019 rights is the only viable way to resist the threats by the state government to prosecute workers and smash the strike.<\/p> <p>The conditions in India for such a struggle are extremely favourable. Less than two weeks ago, tens of millions of workers took part in a nationwide general strike to protest the Modi government\u2019s austerity measures and the gutting of labour regulations. Farmers are engaged in a mass movement against the deregulation of agriculture so as to strengthen the grip of vast agribusiness concerns. An appeal from autoworkers for workers and impoverished rural toilers across India to join and support their struggle would be met with great enthusiasm.<\/p> <p>To fight for this program, striking TKM workers must establish their own independent organizations, rank-and-file action committees, to take control of the strike into their own hands. These committees should establish links with workers at all other industrial facilities in the region, issue appeals for solidarity strike action, and call for a general strike by all workers to force the state government to retract its bullying threats against the TKM strikers.<\/p> <p>The struggle against multinational giants like Toyota and the attempt by India\u2019s ruling elite to offer up workers as cheap labour requires above all an international socialist strategy. Striking workers must strive to unify their struggles with their class brothers and sisters in the United States, Europe, and Japan, who confront the same attacks on their wages and working conditions by the same corporations and ruling elites who are no less ruthless in their insatiable pursuit of profit.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"37SDSEDINBHEK2DS9340SBE78A281W"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1469,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"December","date":null,"city":"Bidadi","region":"Karnataka","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Toyota plant workers, labor union, strike, activists, Bidadi, India","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other state actors","violation_types":["other"],"year":"2020.0","month":"December","date":null,"city":"Bidadi","region":"Karnataka","country":"India","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"Toyota plant workers, labor union, strike, activists, Bidadi, India","victim_type":["trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"unknown","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":941425021,"Input.title":"\"Eight out of ten of the largest enterprises in Belarus are on strike\"","Input.publish_date":"2020-08-18 00:00:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>\"For Your Freedom and For Ours: why the Left should support the protests in Belarus\"<\/p> <p>On 9 August, Belarusians went to the polls in a presidential election that, just like every presidential or otherwise election in long-standing autocrat President Alaksandr \u0141uka\u0161enka\u2019s 26-year-long rule, they already knew would be neither free nor fair. The reigning president had already imprisoned several high-profile political opponents, attempted to prevent opposition rallies, curtailed the number of independent observers at polling stations and attempted to crack down on independent attempts to verify the official results of the vote.

A vast feeling of anti-government fervour gripped the nation, which united behind an unexpected candidate, 37-year-old former English teacher \u015aviat\u0142ana Cichano\u016dskaja. After her husband, blogger Siarhei Cichano\u016dski, was imprisoned by the regime, Cichano\u016dskaja ran for election on a singular platform of three points: a release of all political prisoners, a return to the original, democratic form of the Belarusian Constitution of 1994 and new, fair elections within six months. In running on a platform of intending to organise free elections and immediately resign with no intent to remain in politics after, Cichano\u016dskaja became less a traditional political candidate and more a vector of popular discontent, able to unify all opposition to Luka\u0161enka\u2018s rule under one banner.<\/p> <p>Upon the announcement of the blatantly rigged results of the election where \u0141uka\u0161enka was said by the Central Electoral Commission to have won yet again, thousands of Belarusians took to the streets in protest, intent to end the regime once and for all. The regime responded with great violence, sending riot policemen against grassroots protesters mobilised less by any politician and more by a handful of Telegram channels and young bloggers. At the time of writing there are two confirmed deaths and many more suspected. Thousands were detained in inhuman conditions for days. Cichano\u016dskaja, threatened by the regime, was forced to flee to Lithuania. Despite this, the protests still rage.<\/p> <p>In his 26-year-long rule, \u0141uka\u0161enka (referred in English-language media often by his Russian language name of Lukashenko) systematically dismantled aspect after aspect of Belarusian democracy, establishing himself as the overlord of a country he saw as his own personal fiefdom. He neutered the Constitution of 1994 with constitutional amendments in 1996 and 2004 which respectively replaced a disobedient legislative branch with an obedient bicameral National Assembly composed exclusively of loyalists and eliminated term limits for the presidency. Election after election was marred by extensive fraud, intimidation of opposition candidates and even brutal crackdowns on protesters. The civil rights of Belarusians are brutally suppressed on the regular: Belarus remains the last country in Europe where the death penalty is regularly practiced, and in the early days of the regime a frequent occurrence was the forced disappearance of political dissidents.<\/p> <p>In some sectors of the self-proclaimed left (including even some global heads of state such as President-in-dispute Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela) the regime is praised, for it largely resisted the privatisation drive of the 1990s in the rest of the former Soviet Union which wrested control over large industries from the state and put it in private hands, usually the hands of oligarchs that proceeded to have oversized influence over the domestic affairs of those states. Here two things have to be noted. One, it is that Belarus is a good case study for the truthfulness of the old anti-Stalinist criticism that it is not sufficient for a state to run its industry for it to be run in the interest of the workers and not profit. Since the rigged election on the 9th, Belarusian workers have gone on a general strike demanding the resignation of the illegitimate President and immediate early elections. And who could blame them? The state-run factories are run by appointees of the presidency. Workers\u2019 rights in these factories are habitually violated with the absence of long-term contracts and the existence of no-cause firing, for they are not run to protect Belarusian workers\u2019 jobs as such \u2013 they are run for profit, for the profit of one man who has reordered the state around the singular aim of providing him with personal revenue.<\/p> <p>In the agricultural sector, the regime has reintroduced what it calls serfdom \u2013 and these are their own words \u2013 where agricultural workers are functionally forbidden to resign without permission as their ability to travel or resettle outside their area of residence is legally limited. If the Soviet Union was often criticised by anti-Stalinist leftists as \u201cstate capitalist\u201d due to its economy being predominantly state-run but not actually controlled by the workers, then \u0141uka\u0161enka\u2019s Belarus is what happens when state capitalism is reanimated from the dead through an increasingly horrifying necromantic ritual.<\/p> <p>The second reason why the Western and global left should unconditionally support the protesters in Belarus is a matter of sheer human rights. The Belarusian people do not want much: they merely want a life with dignity and free elections where they can choose their government freely and not fear police violence. To refuse them solidarity even in this would be unacceptable ideological purity testing even if there were no other reasons to back them. But even beyond this, we owe it to our ideological comrades, too. Eight out of ten of the largest enterprises in Belarus are on strike. All the independent trade unions and parties of the Left in Belarus back the resistance \u2013 and suffer the consequences from the regime for this brave stance, too. The banner of the opposition, the \u2018traditional flag\u2019 of Belarus, a white-red-white horizontal tricolour, is in itself in origin a socialist banner, chosen by the Belarusian Socialist Assembly-dominated Belarusian People\u2019s Republic in 1918.<\/p> <p>Just as the global working class struggle for their human rights against the excessive force of the state in Portland, in Beirut, in Israel-Palestine, so they do in Belarus. Socialists everywhere must say: no to violations of human rights. No to rigged elections. No to serfdom, literal and figurative. No to the regime; Belarus lives!<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":6,"HIT_id":"30UZJB2POJRR7N85Y9BG4KJD44F53J"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":686,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"2020.0","month":"08","date":"9.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Siarhei Cichano\u016dski","victim_keywords":"blogger, detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, protesters, riots","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","killing"],"year":"2020.0","month":"08","date":"9.0","city":"None","region":"None","country":"Belarus","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Siarhei Cichano\u016dski","victim_keywords":"blogger, detained","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"citizens, protesters, riots","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"unknown"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":983104475,"Input.title":"In Reversal of Predecessors\u2019 Stance, Macron Orders Arrest of Italian Far-Left Terror Fugitives","Input.publish_date":"2021-05-03 23:12:00","Input.article_interface":"<p>Italian newspapers report on the Frenh arrest in France of Marxist terror fugitives, wanted for crimes carried out in the 1970s-80s.

However, Cape Verde tops the list of African countries with the 25th position, as it is said to have one of the freest media environments in both Africa. Since the 1990s, Cape Verde, with a population of almost 500,000 people, a literacy rate of 71.6 percent, and with 30 percent of its citizens below the poverty line, has been one of the most developed and democratic African countries with a stable representative democracy.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, Nigeria has over 100 independent newspapers, and issues continue to arise when journalists report on politics, terrorism, or financial embezzlement by the powerful. Section 39 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution protects the freedom of expression, but the supposed democratic leaders continue to operate as a military junta, continually devising ways to limit every form of rights as recognised in any democracy.<\/p> <p>Speaking during an interview in January, Governor Ayade explained that the Jalingo, a man standing trial for treason, and could be sent to death for allegedly criticising his government, \u201cacted out of youthful exuberance.\u201d The level of disregard for human life, rights, and justice captured in the statement says a lot about state government led by one of the most educated governors in Nigeria.<\/p> <p>Denying that he ordered the journalist\u2019s arrest, the governor said, \u201cIf you ask Agba Jalingo today, I am the one working with his lawyers for his freedom, I am the one sustaining him and sending upkeeps.\u201d But somehow, popular critics of the governor are arrested for treason and kept in detention.<\/p> <p>Although these journalists are currently on bail, these court cases are not over. On 7 February 2019, the state\u2019s Attorney General, Tanko Ashang, confirmed that the state government would take over the prosecution of Jalingo and that a letter to that effect had been filed in the Federal High Court in Calabar. The government could drag these cases as long as it wants, all in the urge to bankrupt, embarrass and punish these journalists, all because they criticised their state government. What else determines a healthy democracy, but by how free citizens can share their opinions without being attacked?<\/p> <p>Governments, either at the federal or state level, have adopted treason charges and its promise of death or life imprisonment as a means to stifle criticism and civic engagement. No voter or any Nigerian can afford to let that happen. Citizens have the right to hold any government accountable, and it is absurd for any leader to assume that it will always be right on every point.<\/p> <p>From the Social Media Bill and the Hate Speech Bill, to rampant killings by security agents, it appears the urge by political leaders to trample on their citizens is never-ending. We do not operate an ideal democratic government in Nigeria, where the abuse of power and human right is clearly rampant.<\/p> <p>Our justice system is fundamentally flawed, with the judgments and pronouncements clearly favouring those in seats of power or wealth. If Nigerians can learn any lesson from their detention, it is the assurance that the trial will not be the fairest ever seen in the country. With the threats hanging over their heads for basically exercising their civil rights, they deserve support in every form.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":4,"HIT_id":"36BTXXLZ2XN1U6P7VUT2HQGFAP24RP"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":425,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2019.0","month":"September","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cross River","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Agba Jalingo","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason, CrossRiverWatch","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Joseph Odok","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Jonathan Ugbal","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason, CrossRiverWatch, death penalty","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Jeremiah","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason, CrossRiverWatch, death penalty","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention","other"],"year":"2019.0","month":"September","date":null,"city":"None","region":"Cross River","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Agba Jalingo","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason, CrossRiverWatch","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Joseph Odok","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":3,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Jonathan Ugbal","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason, CrossRiverWatch, death penalty","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":4,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Jeremiah","victim_keywords":"journalist, Cross River State, Nigeria, treason, CrossRiverWatch, death penalty","victim_type":["journalist"],"victim_sex_type":"man","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":904785860,"Input.title":"Agba Jalingo: SERAP drags FG, Cross River to ECOWAS Court","Input.publish_date":"2020-02-09 08:50:11","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has dragged the government of Nigeria and Cross River State government of Governor Ben Ayade to ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja \u201cover the prolonged, arbitrary detention; unfair prosecution; persecution, and sham trial of journalist Agba Jalingo.\u201d<\/p> <p>Mr Jalingo, who is the publisher of CrossRiverWatch, was arrested on August 22 over a report alleging that Mr Ayade diverted N500 million belonging to the state.<\/p> <p>In the suit number ECW\/CCJ\/APP\/10\/2020 filed last week at the ECOWAS Court, SERAP is arguing that: \u201cThe sole objective of the government of Nigeria and the Cross River state government of governor Ben Ayade is to perpetually keep Agba Jalingo in arbitrary detention and to silence him simply for expressing critical views and carrying out his legitimate job as journalist.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to the suit: \u201cThis is not the first time the government of Nigeria and the Cross River state government of governor Ben Ayade have taken actions to intimidate, harass and suppress journalists through the instrumentality of trumped-up charges and use of overly broad and unjust laws, including section 24 of Nigeria\u2019s Cybercrime Act, 2015, which provides for the offence of cyber-stalking.\u201d<\/p> <p>The suit filed on SERAP\u2019s behalf by its solicitor Kolawole Oluwadare, states: \u201cthe government of Nigeria and Cross-River state government are using vague laws that give officials massive discretion to undermine human rights.

Between the state polls in 2016 and the national election in 2019, the CPM\u2019s vote share in West Bengal dwindled from 26.6 percent to 7.5 percent. At the same time, the BJP\u2019s vote share rose from 10.16 percent to 40.7 percent.<\/p> <p>The Jangalmahal region, once a left-wing bastion with a large tribal population and one of the state\u2019s most underdeveloped areas, has seen an overwhelming shift to the BJP since 2009.<\/p> <p>Jangalmahal consists of six West Bengal districts \u2013 Purulia, West Bardhaman, Bankura, Birbhum, Jhargram and West Medinipur \u2013 and shares the state\u2019s western border with neighbouring Odisha and Jharkhand states.<\/p> <p>BJP, which had little electoral presence in this region, has virtually wiped out CPM now.<\/p> <p>The left workers think they can enable the vote share of BJP and then get it back once the TMC is out of the way. But it does not work like that. by Ayesha Khatun, left politician<\/p> <p>Kalicharan Shaw, who works for the BJP\u2019s media cell in West Bengal, said the shift from left to right in West Bengal has little to do with ideology.<\/p> <p>\u201cIdeology largely works with the urban, elite electorate, which is still voting for the left,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation in rural areas is different. For them, representation matters.\u201d<\/p> <p>Shaw said the left had West Bengal for 34 years but the party was \u201cdominated by upper castes\u201d among the Hindus.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe state has a significant population of scheduled castes, backward castes and scheduled tribes. They are our biggest vote bank because the left never nurtured or produced a leader from these communities,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Beginning of end<\/p> <p>The tectonic shift away from the left, however, came in 2007 at Nandigram, a town 130 kilometres (81 miles) south of Kolkata, when the government led by Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wanted to acquire farmland to develop a special economic zone.<\/p> <p>But the farmers, backed by opposition leaders, protested the acquisition. To break up the agitation, left-wing cadres allegedly attacked the site. Official records showed 14 deaths, but more than 100 people were said to be missing. Allegations of rape were also made.<\/p> <p>The Nandigram incident marked the beginning of the end for the left in West Bengal. In the last national election held in 2019, it drew a blank. In 2014, it won just two out of 42 seats.<\/p> <p>However, Mohammad Salim, a senior CPM leader, said the situation in West Bengal has changed in the past two years.<\/p> <p>\u201cDuring the coronavirus-induced lockdown, TMC and BJP were nowhere to be seen,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe were in the streets, fighting for those struggling with economic hardships.\u201d<\/p> <p>Salim said the CPM is still raising the issues of students, women and farmers in the current election. \u201cBut the media is ignoring it. We have analysed our failures and you will see a rejuvenated CPM in the upcoming elections,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>On the ground, though, the reality appears to be different. For a party that dominated the Jangalmahal region for years, its presence today is strikingly underwhelming as flags and posters of other political parties drown out the CPM campaign.<\/p> <p>At a brick kiln in one of the remote villages of Purulia district, none of the labourers Al Jazeera talked to said they would vote for the CPM.<\/p> <p>Sadanand Singh, 37, and his wife Dipali, 28, toiling in the twilight in Dabra village, said their families traditionally voted for the CPM, but the next generation has moved away.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe condition of workers like me did not change much,\u201d said Sadanand. \u201cWhen TMC came around, we gave them a chance. But that party also turned out to be disappointing. Now, we have a new option in BJP. We should try that out too.\u201d<\/p> <p>The prospects of a rising BJP, which had little say in West Bengal until 2016, has made several West Bengal observers nervous. The party, heading the federal government since 2014, has been accused of throttling freedom of expression, jailing its critics, and persecuting the minorities, mainly Muslims, who constitute more than 14 percent of the country\u2019s population.<\/p> <p>In Bengal, Muslims form nearly 30 percent of its population, raising concerns over the BJP gaining a strong foothold in the state.<\/p> <p>But critics say the CPM also failed to stop communal forces from entering West Bengal by ignoring the right-wing party. Instead, the CPM were bent on defeating the TMC in the 2019 election.<\/p> <p>In the elections that year, CPM supporters were seen campaigning alongside BJP candidates with saffron flags, while the left-wing party\u2019s leaders were said to be aware of the transfer of their vote to the BJP.<\/p> <p>Former West Bengal Chief Minister and CPM stalwart, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had reportedly warned against this trend. \u201cThere is no use in leaping from a TMC frying pan into the BJP\u2019s fireplace,\u201d he had said.<\/p> <p>Ayesha Khatun, 50, who was the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) candidate in 2014 and 2019 national polls from Rampurhat in Birbhum district, expanded on the \u201cmistake\u201d committed by the communists in propping up the BJP to defeat the TMC.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe left workers think they can enable the vote share of BJP and then get it back once the TMC is out of the way,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cBut it does not work like that.

These agricultural policies are merely the tipping point for the farmers\u2019 movement in India.<\/p> <p>The degradation of farmers\u2019 economy, health and environment has long been neglected by the Indian government, who once caused harmful consequences by introducing corporate control into farming regions<\/p> <p>As farmers reach their tipping point, India\u2019s right-wing government is attacking vocal religious minority groups, convicting journalists, tear gassing protestors and shutting down the internet. Farmers in India are leading the largest protest in human history and finally have the world\u2019s attention. Despite this, right-wing Hindu nationalists target figures who have spoken out about the crisis, like Rihanna and Greta Thunberg, burning their photos on stakes.

SIT chief Arun Bothra revealed the gruesome of how the accused first assaulted the five-year-old minor girl, killed her and then tried having sex with the corpse.<\/p> <p>Talking to the media, SIT chief Arun Bothra said the arrested youth, Saroj Sethi, is the prime accused in the in Nayagarh minor girl murder case. Bothra further revealed that Saroj Sethi was addicted to child pornography and would frequently watch child pornography on his sister's phone.<\/p> <p>The accused saw child pornography on his mobile throughout the night before the day of the crime, added SIT chief Arun Bothra.<\/p> <p>Detailing the evidence that has been obtained during the course of the investigation, Bothra said the minor girl, whose house is about 200 metres from that of accused Sethi, used to go to his house with some children of the village to eat berries from their backyard. Also, the minor girl was very close to Sethi\u2019s younger sister.<\/p> <p>ACCUSED LURED MINOR, TRIED TO HAVE SEX WITH CORPSE<\/p> <p>On July 14, the accused youth was alone in his house as his mother and sister had left for their respective workplaces. The little girl came at around 10:30 am at his house to ask for some berries. Finding her alone, Sethi lured her into a room and removed her frock.<\/p> <p>Later, when he was about to remove her leggings, she resisted and started to scream. As she opposed the assault, Sethi strangled her to death. Following this, he attempted to have sex with the corpse but failed. In the meantime, he had discharged semen on the frock,\u201d Bothra said.<\/p> <p>HUNT TO FIND VICTIM'S MISSING LEGGINGS<\/p> <p>Further narrating details of the barbaric crime, Bothra said after his failed bid to have sex with body, the accused put the body along with the frock inside a jute sack and dumped it in a bush near a pond and covered the gunny bag with coconut tree branches.<\/p> <p>Realizing that he forgot to keep the girl\u2019s leggings in the gunny bag, he again went to his house to get them and later threw them in the pond.

Both her parents were teachers with her elder sister, Luci, following in their footsteps, but Silvia wanted to be a doctor. And thus she became in the early 1970s, during the military dictatorship in her country.<\/p> <p>It was at this point of her life that she first came across the growing movement of activists following the teachings of Silo. This was to be the pivotal moment of her life and changed her forever. His message of how to heal suffering resonated strongly with her, \u201cOnly inner faith and inner meditation can end the violence in you, in others, and in the world around you,\u201d but the strange characters she came across at the time dissuaded her from participating formally!<\/p> <p>Her work with the doctors\u2019 trade union eventually led to a four week period of incarceration during Argentina\u2019s most bloody war against its own people: she was one person among tens of thousands of people arrested at the hands of the military, many of whom were much less fortunate than her. Silvia didn\u2019t need a second warning. Upon her release she kept her head down, earned and borrowed all the money she could and took the first boat to Barcelona where she immediately contacted Siloists who had also established themselves there and started to grow their groups.<\/p> <p>It was through Siloism that she eventually met the man who would be the love of her life, friend, partner and, eventually, her husband, Jon. Siloists from all over the world met in the Canary Islands in 1978 and Silvia met Jon and immediately fell for him (\u201cI had a thing for guys who looked like Jesus Christ\u201d, she told me once) despite the fact that neither spoke more than a few words of the other\u2019s language.<\/p> <p>In 1981, after a 3-year complicated situation for both Silvia and Jon, she moved to London with some rudimentary English and immersed herself into the Humanist Movement which was then developing in the UK. The timing was slightly unfortunate, however, as she almost ended up incarcerated a second time when the Falklands War broke out in April 1982 as the British authorities seriously considered rounding up all Argentine nationals in the country \u201cfor their own protection\u201d.<\/p> <p>Silvia\u2019s Argentinian medical qualifications were not wholly recognised in the UK and thus she had to take UK medical exams and decided to specialise in psychiatry. Eventually Silvia would rise up to be one of the country\u2019s leading forensic psychiatrists, dealing with the most violent female murderers. She spent lots of her professional time in prisons and in court rooms working out how to stop these women from harming themselves and others.<\/p> <p>But her career was never her life. Her life was in Siloism. As for many Siloists, it was the only philosophy that made any sense among all the physical, economic, psychological, sexual, racial and moral violence that the system imposed on the global population every day. In the 80s, she spent hours of her spare time on the streets talking to people about the need for simultaneous personal and social change, building groups of the Community for Human Development, the Humanist Party, the Humanist Movement and later on the Centre of Cultures.<\/p> <p>It was in those days (December 1988) that she met me, an innocent boy from the countryside who knew nothing about anything very important, and spent hours inspiring me to transform my own life using the techniques developed in the Humanist Movement. It was magical the way she told the stories and the way she explained the doctrine. I would sit there in awe, falling in love with the world she was painting in my head, thinking to myself, how will I ever have the capacity to remember all this so that I can repeat it to others? No matter what the situation I found myself in, no matter what the difficulty, Silvia always knew the right part of Silo\u2019s teachings to look in, the right technique, the right anecdote to share.<\/p> <p>Together we tried to humanise first Highgate the neighbourhood where she lived, and then Camberwell where I lived. When that didn\u2019t work very well we launched ourselves overseas joining the growing cohort of humanists who were developing missions to new parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.<\/p> <p>We arrived in Nairobi in August 2000, not knowing what to expect, and ended up coordinating a two-day workshop for 50 people. We couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. For the next 4 years we travelled frequently to Kenya repeating the experience to increasing numbers of people who, we naively thought, saw the world the same way we did. Silvia, inspired by these experiences, started to repeat them in Colombia. Taking sometimes extraordinary risks by travelling by bus through the Colombian countryside in a time of open civil war. She also returned to Barcelona, re-connecting with many friends who she had worked with before in the 1970s. This re-connection brought her enormous joy.<\/p> <p>Silvia, for me, was characterised by her towering intellect and she eventually turned this to writing. In the 1990s she started writing her first book, From Monkey Sapiens to Homo Intentional[1] which was eventually published in 2006. It contained her insights into humanism, psychoanalysis, sociology and behavioural psychology, violence, Darwinism, economics and science, among many other subjects. It was all her take on the world through the lens of Silo\u2019s teaching, and I remember her being absolutely terrified to send Silo a copy! He was possibly the only person who made Silvia ever doubt herself. He gave it his seal of approval, though.<\/p> <p>When Pressenza was launched in 2009 amid the preparations for the World March for Peace and Nonviolence, Silvia joined whole-heartedly. She always had something interesting to say about any current situation in the news and was one of the agency\u2019s most prolific writers. There are 954 entries attributed to Silvia in our archive, translated to all our languages!<\/p> <p>Silvia\u2019s last major writing was a monograph titled, \u201cThe Space of Representation as a Psychosocial Experience, A Psychology of the image, Intentionality, impulses and transcendence at the service of the non-violent revolution\u201d[2]. Silo\u2019s contribution to psychology through his development of the scheme of the consciousness and the space of representation fascinated her. As a psychiatrist she could see all the shortcomings of what western medicine was doing in the fields of psychology and psycho-analysis, but she was wise enough to see where it was doing things well, and also how Siloist Psychology could make a contribution. She rushed to finish her monograph when she was diagnosed in December 2016 with what was a probably mistaken diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The doctors never did find out what was the root of the problem inside her body, but what is certain is that it led to the leukaemia that eventually dealt the final blow.<\/p> <p>The last period since that diagnosis led Silvia to some of the most profound experiences of her life. She dedicated herself to finally resolving all traces of contradiction in her life, reconciling with absolutely everything and everyone. A team of friends all over the world supported her in that period: Ariane, Dani, Karen, Danny, Inma, Monica, Dario, and many, many more in visits to London and from a distance, were able to support her and help her to purify.<\/p> <p>We were all held in a limbo with Silvia\u2019s situation. So many times we thought we were in the last days, and so many times she was stronger than the illnesses that I started to refer to her as my immortal friend! There were dark days, but mostly there were fantastic days. She took her last days of lucidity in hospital in that isolation room, to do a final personal retreat and clean up any loose ends. She stayed absolutely lucid until about 4 days before she left us. That\u2019s how she wanted to go. Brilliant in mind until the end! There\u2019s a document on her computer somewhere with a synthesis of the experience of the last three years which I\u2019m looking forward to reading one day.<\/p> <p>Silvia leaves us in possibly the most interesting time in human history since the Italian Renaissance. The coronavirus pandemic is twisting the world into new paths that were never before imaginable. She was here to witness the opening of a door to a new civilisation, but she wasn\u2019t able to walk through it with us.<\/p> <p>She joins many of her most important guides in the constellation of the great who have come before us in the task of humanising the Earth and paving the way to the brilliant world that she painted in my head all those years ago.<\/p> <p>All of us in Pressenza and everyone who ever knew her will be today giving thanks for the time she spent together with us and for the positive contribution that she was able to make in so many of our lives.<\/p> <p>Silvia Swinden n\u00e9e Bercu (1949 \u2013 2020) leaves behind her husband, Jon and her elder sister Luci.<\/p> <p>Below, we copy the text of the Siloist ceremony of Death, from the book Silo\u2019s Message. No more poignant or useful words are available at this moment.<\/p> <p>Life has ceased in this body. We must now make an effort to separate in our minds the image of this body from the image of the person we remember\u2026<\/p> <p>This body does not hear us. This body is not the person we remember\u2026<\/p> <p>May those who do not feel the presence here of another life, separate from the body, consider that although death has paralysed this body, the actions they carried out will continue to act, and their influence will never end. This chain of actions that was set in motion in life cannot be stopped by death. How profound it is to meditate on this truth, even though we may not completely comprehend the transformation of one action into another!<\/p> <p>And, may those who feel the presence of another separate life, consider that death has only paralysed this body, that the mind has once again triumphantly freed itself, opening its way towards the Light\u2026<\/p> <p>Whatever our views, let us not weep for this body. Rather, let us meditate on the root of our beliefs, and a gentle and silent joy will reach us\u2026<\/p> <p>Peace in the heart, light in the understanding!<\/p> <p>[1] Swinden, S (2006) From Monkey Sapiens to Homo Intentional: The Phenomenology of the Non-Violent Revolution London: Adonis & Abbey Publishers<\/p> <p>[2] Swinden, S (2019) The Space of Representation as a Psychosocial Experience, A Psychology of the image, Intentionality, impulses and transcendence at the service of the non-violent revolution, France: La Belle Id\u00e9e Park of Study and Reflection, accessible at: https:\/\/www.parclabelleidee.fr\/monographies.php<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":5,"HIT_id":"31HLTCK4BNA9ZTZ8ZF0DRC2LL03GVW"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":1206,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Argentina","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Silvia Swinden","victim_keywords":"doctor, Siloist, trade union activist, political prisoner, released, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"political activists, citizens, civilians, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"state actor","violation_types":["arbitrary detention"],"year":null,"month":null,"date":null,"city":"None","region":"None","country":"Argentina","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"individual","victim_name":"Silvia Swinden","victim_keywords":"doctor, Siloist, trade union activist, political prisoner, released, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"},{"victim_idx":2,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"political activists, citizens, civilians, Argentina","victim_type":["human rights defender","trade unionist"],"victim_sex_type":"woman","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":952353303,"Input.title":"Nigeria: #EndSARS Timeline - How Years of Unending Police Brutality Pushed Young Nigerians Into Fierce Demand for Justice","Input.publish_date":"2020-10-20 08:36:30","Input.article_interface":"<p>A protester stands atop a police structure in Ikeja, capital of Lagos state, during #EndSARS demonstrations on October 11, 2020.

More than 35,000 people have been arrested, thousands have been tortured or abused, and 400 political prisoners are currently behind bars. Earlier this week a 50-year-old opposition activist, Vitold Ashurok, died in a penal colony. The official cause of death was \u201cheart attack\u201d. His widow believes he was murdered.<\/p> <p>It is against this dark and repressive backdrop that the extraordinary events of Sunday took place. According to state media, Lukashenko personally authorised the forced downing of a Ryanair plane as it flew over Belarusian airspace between Greece and Lithuania \u2013 a real-time hijacking. He even dispatched a MIG-29 fighter jet to ensure the pilot complied after being informed of a fake bomb threat.<\/p> <p>The target of Lukashenko\u2019s fury was a 26-year-old passenger and opposition blogger, Roman Protasevich. Protasevich is the co-founder of Nexta, a Telegram channel. Since last August\u2019s presidential election, widely seen as rigged, it has reported on, and coordinated demonstrations against, the Belarus regime. These continue. Like other critics he had left Belarus for exile. And what he must have thought was the safety of the EU.<\/p> <p>Protasevich was arrested when his plane landed in Minsk. His Russian girlfriend who was with him, Sofia Sapega, was detained too. Their whereabouts are unknown. The shocking incident has provoked widespread international condemnation and horror. On Monday Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, called it \u201cair piracy\u201d. Foreign ministers have dubbed it in-flight kidnapping, blatant \u201cstate terrorism\u201d and sheer thuggery.<\/p> <p>The dilemma for western governments is how to respond. According to Andrei Sannikov, a former Belarus presidential candidate imprisoned in 2010, the regime is not merely enacting the worst domestic crackdown in Belarus since its independence from the Soviet Union \u2013 beating up its own, as he put it. It poses a grave threat to other countries, he said. Most of the passengers on board \u2013 171 of them \u2013 were EU citizens.<\/p> <p>Sannikov described Lukashenko\u2019s embattled Moscow-backed government as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d. \u201cYes, Lukashenko is a psychopath, a dangerous one,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThis is a test for the international community in general. The west has yet to find instruments and tools to deal with him. Maybe the hijacking will trigger something. These are not empty threats. Not even North Korea would do something like this.\u201d<\/p> <p>The hijacking raises the nightmarish prospect that Lukashenko may now carry out other special operations against critics living abroad. The head of Belarus\u2019s KGB, Ivan Tsertsel, has promised to eliminate all \u201ctraitors to the motherland\u201d. In April his colleague Gen Nikolai Karpenkov, head of internal forces, said participants in peaceful rallies would face \u201cinevitable retribution\u201d and be \u201ctreated as terrorists\u201d. State TV has talked of Stalin-style killings.<\/p> <p>Just a few hours before his plane was forcibly landed, Protasevich reported he was under surveillance at Athens airport. A Russian-speaking man dressed in a T-shirt and chinos stood behind him during boarding and tried to take photos of his ID, he said. At Minsk four passengers slipped off the plane and disappeared. They appear to be intelligence officers working for Belarus\u2019s KGB. At least two reportedly had Russian passports.<\/p> <p>02:00 Belarus seizes blogger after 'hijacking' Ryanair flight \u2013 video report<\/p> <p>If Russia had a role in the hijacking is unclear. Its FSB spy agency recently helped to arrest an opposition activist in Moscow accused of plotting a \u201ccoup\u201d against Lukashenko and Russian state media has praised Belarus\u2019s president for his \u201cbeautiful\u201d and uncompromising move. The incident, some believe, will further estrange Belarus from Europe, to the Kremlin\u2019s advantage.<\/p> <p>Already it has having a chilling effect on other dissidents. Natalia Kaliada, co-founder of the Belarus Free Theatre, was due to meet Protasevich this week. She told the Guardian she spoke with the pilot and airline on Sunday after boarding a flight from London to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. \u201cThe plane was put on alert. It avoided Belarus airspace. I\u2019ve had multiple death threats since November and December,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>In recent months the mass protests against Lukashenko have diminished. According to Sannikov, however, the regime is weaker than it seems, with Lukashenko reliant on his security forces. Behind the scenes there are defections and suicides, he said. \u201cLukashenko doesn\u2019t control the state anymore or the economy or government. He\u2019s only meeting with the men in uniform,\u201d he added. \u201cThe protests may be less. But hatred of Lukashenko personally is growing. It\u2019s leading to an explosion.\u201d<\/p> <p>According to Nigel Gould-Davies, Britain\u2019s former ambassador in Minsk, the EU and UK should consult with the Belarus opposition co-ordinating committee before deciding on possible sanctions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t only about Belarus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Belarus gets away with it other countries will likely be emboldened to have a malign interest in getting hold of people who have fled abroad.\u201d Sunday\u2019s events showed Lukashenko\u2019s weakness, he pointed out, noting: \u201cHe can\u2019t regain legitimacy.\u201d<\/p> <p>For Belarus\u2019s embattled journalistic community, meanwhile, it has been a disastrous period. The country\u2019s biggest non-state media outlet \u2013 the website tut.by \u2013 was shut down last week, with many of its staff rounded up and arrested. Currently 30 journalists are in prison. They now include Protasevich, who faces charges of organising mass riots and organising group activities which \u201cviolate public order\u201d.

Both regional shipping and oil and gas operators should expect further disruptions to supply chains, export routes and increased costs as more ransom payments will be necessary to liberate crews.\u201d<\/p> <p>About 60 per cent of incidents in 2019 occurred in Nigerian territorial waters, specifically in the areas surrounding the Niger Delta, and to a lesser extent, the shipping hub of the Port of Lagos. Raymakers highlighted that the socio-economic factors underpinning these incidents were unlikely to change.<\/p> <p>\u201cDriven by their experience fighting in the Delta\u2019s secessionist armed groups and embittered by their lack of access to the oil riches around them, the region will remain an abundant reservoir for budding pirates.<\/p> <p>\u201cAlthough pirates have not noticeably changed their tactics, the regular payments of ransoms have likely emboldened them to seek more attractive targets further out at sea, expanding their net outwards,\u201d he added.<\/p> <p>On March 22, seven crew members of the MSC Talia F were abducted off the coast of Gabon, and while most of the spike in cases is expected in Nigerian waters, Verisk analysts also anticipate upticks in the waters around Togo, Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and to a lesser extent Ghana.<\/p> <p>While pirates traditionally limited their operations to raiding oil tankers in order to sell their hold on the black market, the collapse of oil prices in 2015 forced them to alter their strategy, refocusing their efforts on abducting crews for ransom, Raymakers highlighted.<\/p> <p>\u201cIOCs like Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron and Eni operating out of Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Nigeria are particularly at risk of experiencing sporadic yet highly disruptive instances of piracy in their supply chains,\u201d Raymakers said.<\/p> <p>Given the recent collapse in global oil prices due to falling demand, Verisk anticipates that pirates are likely to attempt to board static tankers used as offshore storage facilities for unsold production. The ships\u2019 crews and cargo represent \u201cideal and relatively simple targets for pirates,\u201d the report said.<\/p> <p>The indiscriminate nature of abductions means pirates are likely to target IOCs\u2019 supply chains and oil shipments leaving export terminals in the Niger Delta, as evidenced by the abduction of seven crew members on the ExxonMobil-contracted supply vessel Zaro off the coast of Equatorial Guinea in December 2019.<\/p> <p>\u201cIOCs will also have to contend with the risk that pirates will seek to abduct workers, particularly expatriates, directly from oil platforms in the Niger Delta.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe kidnapping of three oil workers from a Chevron oil platform in Ogbele in April 2019, highlights the ease and speed with which such an operation can be conducted.<\/p> <p>\u201cIndeed, pirates have easy access to high speed crafts and a plethora of small arms giving them the firepower and agility to conduct such operations,\u201d Raymakers said.<\/p>","Input.batch_idx":7,"HIT_id":"3J9L0X0VDH17Z8C5BJZZLXZCOT3W9I"},"annotations":[{"worker_id":"d73bfc82-4452-4645-868c-0a1b8a80e08d","work_time_in_seconds":679,"annotation":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Ogbele","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"oil platform workers, ship workers, non-combatants","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}}],"merged_sample":{"perpetrator_mention":true,"perpetrator_type":"other actors without permissions","violation_types":["kidnapping"],"year":"2019","month":null,"date":null,"city":"Ogbele","region":"None","country":"Nigeria","victims":[{"victim_idx":1,"victim_population_type":"multiple","victim_name":null,"victim_keywords":"oil platform workers, ship workers, non-combatants","victim_type":["insufficient information"],"victim_sex_type":"other","victim_age_group":"adult"}]}},{"sample":{"Input.GLOBALEVENTID":945955885,"Input.title":"Nigeria: Group Demands Unconditional Release of Arrested Protesters, Journalists in Lagos","Input.publish_date":"2020-09-11 09:19:02","Input.article_interface":"<p>The Socialist Party of Nigeria (SPN) has called for the unconditional release of journalists and protesters that were arrested in Lagos.<\/p> <p>Premium Times gathered that police in Lagos on Thursday arrested 14 protesters who marched in Lagos in protest against the deregistration of political parties and increase in fuel price and electricity tariff.<\/p> <p>Four journalists, who were covering the protest, were also arrested and taken to the state police command in Ikeja.<\/p> <p>The protest was organised by the Socialist Party of Nigeria; the group is demanding a reversal in the actions of the government.<\/p> <p>Some of the arrested protesters include Dagga Tolar, SPN NEC member; Chinedu Bosah, SPN National Secretary; Hassan Taiwo Soweto, SPN National Youth Leader, and 11 others.<\/p> <p>The arrested journalists are Ifeoluwa Adediran of PREMIUM TIMES, Abiodun Ayeoba of Sahara Reporters; Awoniyi Oluwatosin of ObjecTV media and Daniel Tanimu of Galaxy TV whose camera was seized.<\/p> <p>But, SPN while reacting, called for the immediate release of the arrested persons without delay.<\/p> <p>The group in a statement signed by its National Chairperson, Abiodun Bamigboye, condemned what he termed as unjust arrest of members and journalists for protesting against anti-poor policies by the President Muhammadu Buhari government.<\/p> <p>Mr Bamigboye in the statement sent to Premium Times, on Thursday, demanded an end to the violation of human rights under the Buhari government.<\/p> <p>He said, \"The Socialist Party of Nigeria (SPN) strongly condemns the brutalisation and arrest of members of our party and journalists by officers of the Nigerian Police Force.

It has thus resorted to brute force to sustain its rule.

It shows the level of disregard for fundamental human rights by the APC\/Buhari adminstration.<\/p> <p>\"We in the Socialist Party of Nigeria (SPN) reiterate our rejection of the inhumane increase in fuel price and the hike in price of tariff. This sad development further shows that a system designed to meet the profit interest of the few over the wellbeing of the vast majority is incompatible with human development. We join Nigerians to reject this vicious anti-people policy of increments in fuel price and electricity tariff and the horrific condition that the ruling class has thrown the country into.<\/p> <p>\"The Socialist Party of Nigeria (SPN), demands an end to all attacks on democratic rights by the Buhari\/APC government. We also call on the leadership of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) to wake up from their slumber and begin to mobilise the working masses of Nigeria against the anti-people policies of the APC\/Buhari administration.
